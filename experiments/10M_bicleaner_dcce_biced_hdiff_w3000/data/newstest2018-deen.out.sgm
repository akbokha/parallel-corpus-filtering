<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your gaze at the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt, where young people are supposed to take place today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pinch chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners economies the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card estuary supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if land cards are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that the car-Navi had to be showing a green lawn instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, offering an offering of the antoportals of Bavaria, are anything but actual - but just so very illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which is not equal to such such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great coverage map, detailed cards were set up for cities and municipalities, so called Urgonslauleaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">This resulted in the Bavarian intermeasurement management system between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and issued a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops reached the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, they were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-Card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian State Department." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urgplant paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all others on the Bayerisches Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">Compared early in the morning, the country's capital is most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is undertaking that occurs relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the card, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendest focus on 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when observing, a smaller piece with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered ranges from the so-called "urine" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots have no more farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 in the 10th century, was actually a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the Urgonspaper you read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen area not only the street names" "" "on the Gastro" "" "or by the hill" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once blocked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was the Munich county-Irrenanstalt at the Auer Lünen there in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden directed the facility - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "it was advanced in his time and ended for example the Ankets of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "in addition, he prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the occupants," "" "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied herself for an exhibition with the Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first, later on 500 places were extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">At any time this capacitance was not enough - the reason for construction of the circle of the circle in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatria.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt there are now youth in the Munich Salesian.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and moved him to a youth centre with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located in the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of the cottage from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in architectural splendidly on the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during bombing raids during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was located at 1856 as the head square, "Kaufinger's name was named" Kaufinger Gasse. "</seg>
<seg id="45">The second world war also brought a decisive change in the heart of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied Forces outlined a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses, and a pylon of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where this day began working, and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil law published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to discriminatory policies and racial attacks of the state to Missouri." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which should come into force on August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to travel through the state, as a number of unquestionable, racial secures in the entire country, and here," "" "says it in the statement of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win Discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, the majority of the state, caused the event to publish the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the citizenship, human beings.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be induced or killed because of their skin colour, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "Sanders died at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police in Missouri, without being accused of a crime." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also has a recent report of the Missouri's Office of General Missouri by showing that black car driver in the state will be 75 percent more common than white." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"people have to be willing to bring if it had a matter of matter, or let the relatives know they can travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 years of work in the year 2015, according to the latest numbers from the Trial Chamber of the FBI, the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sustain a company for residency or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued plans for Texas and Arizona, after the United States had adopted immigration authorities to restrict people due to immigration, which will contribute to further pedigree.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warning are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but lately, stakeholders have adopted the measure as response to certain laws and trends in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Wheelaunus Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsorded Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">The representatives of the fishing villages of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisher CDU local community together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave insights into operation in which he supplies 55 hectares of grass and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows, and also many young animals, and houses all the houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so vignes.</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the Ferienges comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BAHV-Chairman of Fishbach, he identified the decaunching project as "elementative."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot act on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The Grünlandscaping care of a lot of work needs to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and to fight with Topography," "" "stressed andemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elical operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the deceit project and is happy with the promotion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">In this way, we hope that the overlap of the surfaces could still be gone out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the subsidy</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in total by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is 40 hectares that can not be enforced until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of our leader was promoted, a quarter contributed by the municipality of Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers stay 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of consecrates.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences" explained hindemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, no farmers and any country of agriculture won't go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White:" "" "here best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes of Landscape (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides the state subsidy of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black force.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence is one of the LPR reported funding transactions.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area may not be bad (slope for more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by collecting.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump now takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to start, when they start to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans also appreciate the same as any other - hence the catastrophic fall Saddam Hussein's place at firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic strife with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President of the drastic restriction of the legal emigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller do not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat cruises and Liberty Draitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the meaning which you were attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an American freedom, which lights up the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">This poem, which you refer to, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is reasonable right, but as he formulated it, it's not really around history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemporating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only charges an old immigrant, but the wormsts of the poor:" "" "your troubles, your poor, / your afflicted masses, which are longing to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There has never been a time in which the "elying waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict on the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus, and her friends, who used to place their words after her death at the base - did very well know that she was a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show connections between French and American republicism as shown in an unused classical illustration of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change their right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big screhroom Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty is anyone looking for the American Flame to the converted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine through the way in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather uncommon, Limbaugh is pushed out here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of a standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they had seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of men who are seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the will they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this obviously is not the perspective which Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Your torch should not shine, but hatred, who is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black engaged Scottish members of the UK team</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - can compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle became captain of the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitalists "speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or who they live or exercise, went out of the room, felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh was quite natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">"" "the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete in her fifth world championships for the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "" "unbelievably" "" "that 16 shallots are in the British team." ""</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the World Championship were seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman running after a great season who included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the man captains says that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only belonging to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing to be team captains, if it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mate for me voted and voted for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>

<seg id="155">What my speech affects as chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">To block critics via Facebook: don't throw yourself about a public ministry if you cannot tolerate the consumption of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"" "" "" "the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the papers fell on him because of the interior policy up to its political principles." ""</seg>
<seg id="163">It shimped during the critique, secure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and silly and dumb we will lead like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees blocked contributions of at least 450 persons and sold their opinions on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the staff of the Governors" "" "dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's very important when it is a type like Hogan expected.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the Nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to compose himself with his voters and decompose his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons, who arrive on the site of the Governors - a public forum, is considered officially and by employees who get paid in public tax dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr. Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of Trollen or sprife-filled people who force the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan expected.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post office and appeals to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not ugly, but she asked for hatching.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the comment field of news broadcast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same theme takes place, then they are disregarded as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the Governors referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "intercede."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in previous age, if you have done the same thing that employees were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductors and to scorch or demonstrators to silence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens now.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to be criticized that he impacted facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is claiming by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County discloses the First Amendment, according to US District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they served a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Letin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At present, Washington's time had a similar effect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters rendered to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous Trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"" "the people, the pseudonyms, like" "" "Juricola," "" "" Belisarius "" "" and "" "" Portius "" "," wrote all the letters to newspapers, which made Washington's decisions. "" "</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping of the UK, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents which were collected by the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery-Areal in Tummy on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30pm for a Serenade.</seg>

<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth charity enserenade can enchant himself from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescuing and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and supporters for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned in documents for the first time: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the Holy Mass in Tummy with the Vogister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the certificate according to the certificate of the certificate there was also a scenic farm, which belonged to the church or patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"" "as from the description of the Oberamused Freudenstadt in 1858, alongside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are currently still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the" "" "mountain" "" "is the third, the ancient settlers of the village." ""</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 capitalized this historical events.</seg>

<seg id="477">A Lord, who built a church, occupied and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit such a church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus the right to use a priest or the bishop would have a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two crust at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the second world war in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the window discs were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was intight.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops were in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörbroiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the graveyard was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower one had to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Years Eve 1834 the storm sank the church tower and half plunged.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower's tower only existed today, the witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim has denied" Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) urged to withstand its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>

<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place for Joanne.</seg>

<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper engraving from Retrouvius looks across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>

<seg id="1346">Thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage room Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The large-area of a trillion tonne is heavy and 5800 square kilometres drive now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in breaking of the iceberg is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, since around 30 years there have been a series of unusual interruptions of ice skating in the region, writes the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, these can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colonies has been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimming in the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow in the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Scheldung is situated south of South America nearly on the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this crawmill was the balance of waxing and cancelling a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelspring is broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate stands under voltage and could be broken if at a key point a piece abstained.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg will not increase sea level, as they swim in the water and melt the ice as much water as it yields.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the spring goes on that the glaciers directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, however only in a low degree, writes the UK research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest incision of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although there is a natural look and we have no direct connection to climate change, the iceis now comes into a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest retreat since the beginning of records," confirmed, too.</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "scientists say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now rise again or over the long term, and possibly together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models said it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers did not lead the crash of this gigantic ice cream on climate change, so many ice skiers in the Antarctic Peninsula have been debutable in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long wave of Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one might be more often present on these markets, than once per year, to send to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">While E-Sport are games games like "League Of Legends," "DotA 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA at the competition level.</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is safe to use.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is capable of competitively and many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a speedy response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only train the console, but also exercise their bodies and respect for nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) is ahead of e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tourneys.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The turnover in three years is expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already continuing.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be an legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to claim another committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Rodoce meet usually on Wednesday to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, organized by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug control.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two highly challenging journalists will discuss what feels safe: they are supposed to take their children with the office which were 2009 the target of a attack with grenades, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words onto a table on the front of the room: enemies, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the Reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartel, a catalog of breaches that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest from violence, and during the whole country, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered into office in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats under federal protection, there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publisher and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply receptive, even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, that shows its middle finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, that are his ridiculous face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although the Attorney General has been erected in 2010, to edit the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most thousands of murder, each year with drug trafficking and organised crime are linked, the murderers of journalists are only rarely judged on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still standing on treated to treat the violence of Sinaloa, though it is unconsolable, though the terrain is still availlastic yet.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without righteousness, the meeting on discussion of safety is little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why we are suspicious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to take a few blocks far away, before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced from his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelder River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The guns went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to go freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"" "" "" "since Guzman's arrest in the United States last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields in order to fight the vacuum." ""</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of mutually, two-story mausoleums for drug purposes, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state, with its precious harbours and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez is aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, there was a publication of a interviews with a garo Lopez, a leader among the rival cartography in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may upset the children, though the crew purchased every copy of the issue as soon as she was extradited to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to force a newspaper, following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, the country has to leave its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a landmark in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues might imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate from journalism without having to stumble on the fake venom problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the paper also earned a reputation for the courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters love to publish hard-proof tests without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories not to treat them anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists to protect journalists from the prosecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever he was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to fear.</seg>

<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine to become routine?</seg>

<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before, it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, used to supervise journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, who described the governor themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It's months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug members are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blown up three main histories.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit Gallery is moving people, although they are not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone divides the population of advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold, the subject is hardly any cold.</seg>

<seg id="2094">"" "" "" "while the advocates make that a Gallery draws more customers to the city, of which the other shops benefit, fear the opponents, that the pedestrian precursed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned right on the property, on which the farmers market stands, in which 13 direct investments will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - as a Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maids are always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothes, footwear, dropping or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops are vacated here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mainly offered by producers and is also very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores exist almost no more and what is left of it will probably even disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market stand during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration, if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates the ghosts bit gallery before going to banish all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that won't work simply.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But thanks to phantastic construction, there is no space for a peasant market in many - like me - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound perfect for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causes gastclamps and blows, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those that are usually advised to alleviate flesh and dairy products found researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells, which promote an tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The executive explorer, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes that are hidden in the food, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger infections are offset by cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments that a type of tolerance subsidy immune cell comes in mice that carry a particular bacterium in its innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and developing a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immunity. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan diet tolerated, less inflammatory bowel diseases, if the same system works in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of students had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It is thought that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbial of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were missing in a sterile environment, so they did not develop a bowel microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers removed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerate the tolerant conveyor cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant conveyor-giving cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us from our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if Tryptophan side products from L. reuteri found the cells at men such as in mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells are controlling inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2628">There were pitfalls.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>

<seg id="2632">The surprising question of questionnaire by the Greens MEPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, President of the SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony is after the surviving of the green deputies of the CDU to the CDU without their own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, no longer, the comrades soothed down.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Everything will be different after the federal elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This was then also - and everything was clearly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taumeln, the Dusseldorf-Pleite party felt smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades reported to meet the comrades in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When she had just had a new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And the next fall came with him.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his aura at that weekend, because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burnt.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did something wrong in the crisis communication, what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz is fighting for political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-gas affaires and its role in the Supervisory Board, the lower saxonian Prime Minister had already been in the critique for some time.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Several surveys were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps, because in the past weeks, because in the past weeks, Weil tried to set accents in the covenant.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The ambition of the former mayor of Hannover to expand its power in Berlin, was also not concealed in Martin Schulz as well.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They left him, as they promised by Weil a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Thus, because in the partisan horn, the lower Saxon Green is basically no guilt.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz is not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Sometimes, the comrades endeavours to keep the own ranks closed.</seg>

<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary question, complains a "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the watchman of four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil to prime minister," says Oppermann, who carries the lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the German elections, the RND.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President on board is the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-president Mike Pence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter used in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South Lawn, after the recordings of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted to be aware of that, because it is an unusual event with high visibility," "" "said the Commander of HMx-1 on the eve of the event its predecessor, the Deputy Military Tribunal for Aircraft." ""</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter hoved around 15 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn at the South Lawn and so long until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours a second squad would be needed for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original flight was during the helicopter, while security personnel remained on the ground during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by the TIME were not clear, but ultimately, a second flight number was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal authority to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMx-1 has asked whether the event could hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "" "" "a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="2730">But the official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">On the event, the President gave a impulse to the reform of the health reform, which was underway in the Senate and he prophesied the efforts to overcome the rule of government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obligated to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-operation is uncommon.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in order to extradite Helicopter's helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain budgetary drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the academic year of the Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD replacement for the VH-3D was 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are lying close at this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain is not given up in the pursuit of Neymar after receiving an offer of £189 million in order to emulate its freewheel clauses, but have they warned us three years ago in front of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has been heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way, how Neymar has forced his way to outside, although a source of the Catalans board has always given that the club has always been his best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago from the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City will show interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi was a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign a one of the best players from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I'm not worried about knowing if they touch one of our players, then we will contact them in opposition, we will contact them," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the beginning of this summer with the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made clear that it would not allow it to leave the International from Italy, under any circumstances, and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing some of their price quotes by Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparrow-Report" was the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Brandenburg Domsparrow report on the abuse of abuse has relieved Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domsparrow continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated after publication by the German press agency, he observatory from the former Regensberg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerge Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very common to see the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret on their own undercover or their wrong evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican authority" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however, criticised that in the reporting of violence at the Domab pads with" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "regards the grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be punished by" "" "shameful and shameful action" "", "but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit that signifies the Catholic Church as a source of all evil work is already a part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that for normal" "", "Scaraffia writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis meant in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we're looking forward to the church and this is a found frescos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "stripes have been a quite educational means" "" "to be done with fret children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann means" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "written with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "Hesemann," "" "for all of this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the findings of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report which was awarded by the bishop in Regensburg with the reconnaissary lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensile Domsparks were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "victims of overprint, 67 Domsparks sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">"" "in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "" "so," "" "summarize that from Domenellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and mental force were applied." ""</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even at high Emotions, the punishment for students could also be more ferocious.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike numerous other accusations, many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report describes the abuse of Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence on protective results" "" "there is a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Many students bring forth his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it also appears as a Choleriker and perfectionist, which was able to handle the more difficult times when a Domotatz was no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyse this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are devoted to him and it is acquitted clearly by every suspicion of the mid- or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence took place outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">They can ban it if late, too late, or have not taken our first hints seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "in practically all the respondents, in which he worked, was" "" "redemption" "" "in practically all respondents -" "" "redemption" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger represents a very excellent report, describes him as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "sinent" "" "and" "" "understanding" "", "as an extremely skilled teacher, who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high Emotions, who also led to Wutausquarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he threw not only with chairs and threw the key ring onto the ground, but also earing too bold guys on the hair or ears, he has already been granted, deeply regret, and apologize for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "however, to his honour, however, that such educational methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely distributed in parents as with teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes on in this report, namely the appealing sexual abuse and the non-violence on the preschool, that is certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You're wondering if it doesn't seem to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, are still eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report abduced Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media reports were clearly reported about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domsparrow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also undertake any transaction or scaffinity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother to talk about it," "" "said a concrete representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with reconnaissance of sexual abuse has been and yet is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows student Ratzinger play a role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had left untimely findings and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" ""... "I think it..." "" "it is also absurd to assume that it exclude him... Buben an urgent or clearer or more obvious or more obvious, compared to their parents, internators, trust teachers etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to a clear result:" "" "the pupils involved in advance and / or their surroundings, could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What concerns sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus exemplified by every mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to put his good name with these contracted crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violent food" "" "was to be read by the shelters in the cathedral-cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domencapmaster Georg Ratzinger will be thrown out in his report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage all blends and mentions to a huge bag of sexual abuse and violent exchanges and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clean separately: between the preschool and the high school of Domsparrow, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other claims.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents in the period since 1945, so after four decades of which Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where the lad were tortured and painstakingly contested, and among them suffered, happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where truly skinous states have to have reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on his face when they were already in the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most of the witnesses are emphasized, the topic "Vorschule" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium physique?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there indeed were discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at the conclusion that the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims were incriminated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">The most accusation, at most, remains to be looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the conditions at school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself, and from operations at a school which he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) would not hear, and then again at 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Lock Georg Ratzinger consistently upheld the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral Division, which was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way, he points out that in the preschool, the test penalty will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">He recommended even in face of the risk of negative profits.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was banned when testing was also forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that she occurred in a lawnly gray area, as everyone knows of us know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate him, where the people were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where truly the admissible border had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he would have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards for that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about" "" "pitfalls of Anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger, past today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of adversaries and violence against innocent children's men, that's far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all quite dreadful and I'm glad that it will finally be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all of this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishment, so to give ear and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was prohibited, it also strives around.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his regained time, George Ratzinger has played in the discussions with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of the test conducted in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, the cathedral-cats only played a minor part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Still, I don't waste any way, that he led an austere regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said: without these perfectionism, without signifying unconditional discipline, it wouldn't have been possible to form the real cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone one does not make a big singer and a huge singer every success, but always in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger and experienced again as a wonderful, humorous, believing, deep believing and heartily good people, from whom you can't imagine that he could just do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, like many former Domsparks still today, 23 years after his Emeritus, regularly contact him to visit him, he is almost blind and as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him till today, that he was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him that he enrich their lives and brought about the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respect person was to look at her today and honoring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even more clearly: everything you have imagined, are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overovercome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make media coverage.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the evil intention behind it, but it is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published was relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now it would be a 93-year-old man who has gained great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany nobody would have known the Regensburger Domsparks to finally make peace." ""</seg>
