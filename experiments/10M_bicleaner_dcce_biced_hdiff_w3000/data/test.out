&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will surely miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he never wanted to participate in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .

Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
that the Hollywood star has clearly made clear of the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or get exposed from the outside label who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather j@@ ok@@ ing . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the actress give her time home , front TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , they bring the question after the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not have married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother to see two sons .
the film runs from August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger will receive the pil@@ es of sport
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a gol@@ ft@@ ist in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked a little bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered her end , they were hunting in the fast Gal@@ lop into the feeding trou@@ gh .
one kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding arri@@ vals ended again then again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all times - 101 tournaments - again nearby horses .
he left with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , he did not sw@@ inging on a horse .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German gy@@ ms handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
in awards it does not lack the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed him .
the 18th century winner of the pyramid of sports is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only granted for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger supports the offspring for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro to the same time .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US mast winner was induc@@ ed into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
among the winners , the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ des and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ves , the poet Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob Young Driver , Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the jumping of the tut@@ el@@ ites , Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous , is Ludwig Gor@@ geous .
many of these sport participants were gone to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential candidates are in their tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small , and warns about how the state of economy cannot harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
by contrast , it would be different , claimed to be Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will fri@@ ghtened controls , and he is strong for far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , against it , says : the State has certain tasks to open , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
that is why the taxes were increased to the rich , says they .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
to be invested in the m@@ uts , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost exactly .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party of the Republi@@ can stri@@ pe .
thus , a partial internal discussions could be delivered on Tr@@ ump .
clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and to drive coal in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ osition of trade agreements , do not want to sign .
at the same time both , however , both the USA will not isol@@ ate from international trade but just American jobs .
they should be paid better then , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
she wants to raise him up to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics are holding him before , so the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least the rich the rich they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any Dam@@ ned woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who escape alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her young son in his arm .
he rocks with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother wa@@ its on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the Vice President of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and among others she deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of the north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made on their run experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they are torture or death , because their families will send them to Europe as a hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal it secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her homeland , they had experience with sexual violence , ken@@ nel , hon@@ esty , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
this is driving her away .
it goes on the escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the tu@@ g@@ boats call for a bottle of water a sexual action , is not a r@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrived in Germany , remember B@@ ahr .
even here all single women in refugee income would often consider as inferior and worst case ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the north of the north , are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were so used that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not able to help , I need more accommodations just for them , called B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments have been responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
at the question of whether they wish from a similar project as in Munich , some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are no such thing in accommodations of governments .
also in Schw@@ aben alone , women escaped non @-@ separated women , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are two floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published in the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may be too - continuous - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the Wash@@ rooms should be separate and easy to access for women , is in the study .
how much the women of this protection need sense , you can read on the crowds that exists in the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has been spoken around , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands according to new work@@ stations
the assist@@ ants of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new work@@ stations in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council , to appro@@ ve more work measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there should be a minister , to worry about the contract .
assistance and medical students enrolled in July about the ref@@ usal of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A contract .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be problems which led the contract rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC committee voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and call on official new negotiations to all emails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board asked an formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of cal@@ ising workers which begins early September .
the disputes resulted in assist@@ ants this year , six times wi@@ ped , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election , the BM@@ A Assist@@ anc@@ ellor Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana re@@ signed to the election of the agreed agreement conditions that were advised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Doc@@ tors for Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Out@@ side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and an official end of the eight months long lasting war@@ fare of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin receives its Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace in reception , I cannot deny that Ankara denied this reconciliation .
there was a stop , yes .
but Put@@ ting sm@@ iles had an alli@@ ed and radiant heat , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdogan immediately spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis but even further improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had so much worse than would never happen .
me , his enthusiasm , seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduction : the shot of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ured .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall in the back .
the walk was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ i will be re@@ build again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
during the period , the government controlled media led a violent , non @-@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed as the Turks would bear it for everything .
the acc@@ us@@ ations of senior civil servants , that pean@@ og@@ ans have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria in Syria , to be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message said that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting only took place because Putin got the ap@@ ology of President that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are obvious .
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends that he can get after he was be@@ headed by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are res@@ umed .
they are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week forec@@ asted public transportation , vegetables and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists where long , tomatoes are long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West because its response to the attemp@@ ted power supply was regarded as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the g@@ out on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state of state won a bonus in Ankara following the attemp@@ ted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well @-@ noticed for Moscow , a self @-@ understanding that has self @-@ sigh@@ ted fear of regim@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace built by Russia and Turkey , as it declared to me an analy@@ st once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that encounter the west and being badly handled and ign@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but in Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first call , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have accepted the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of Turkey has deliber@@ ately promised to answer a question about their differences , whereas Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found on Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , NATO member Turkey has shot the Russian battle jet , it certainly is better to talk to each other at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global amb@@ itions of the bank .
the bank has since dist@@ anz@@ ed since eight years ago , the bank had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved .
in this time , brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer financial brands .
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by up to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised headquarters and its stock exchange to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN has been inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland to : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be one of our investment brand as well as to the brand in which our staff will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will be his six Nations sponsor@@ ship not going to continue to increase the perception of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , as we focus on making this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori att@@ ained to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction his 3@@ .000@@ ,000 profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings to him 3@@ .000@@ ,000 profit
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 5,@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with its second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ then winner D@@ ett@@ ori who won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy about what happened in New@@ market , because I have landed 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ en Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I &apos;m reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the le@@ ver when he gets to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ct the Victory
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s have reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey which is modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few minutes before him .
it has style and is strong , but its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the others in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma already impressed fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks prior to ep@@ s@@ om that he had already scored 6.000 wins if he was not only a weekend and Grand tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie has played a winner almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated a milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ished to Flying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the hands of the British flat race for two decades .
it was anno@@ ying .
a whole series of big tournament win , including his famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ rich Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and obtained a drug ban .
three years ago , he had trouble passing in difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to with@@ stand his two fl@@ yers and returning to his efforts .
and he has not yet been at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions until at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years .
Russian Putin relies on Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V had been part of Putin &apos;s close association of trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special officer for environmental and transport agents .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin ordered the mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential department . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Vice @-@ President since 2012 , was named to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn , Germany , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo message .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later Chief of the Chief of Staff and Chief of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the most important task of government to support your activity as head of government regarding bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and put V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this stage has made Moscow myst@@ eries .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time in Vladimir Putin &apos;s strict confi@@ denti@@ ality and works as he was for the Soviet secret service to the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff re@@ affir@@ med his own request .
but despite the smile for cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently knows this .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once quoted as potential president , would like to run into Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin site , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is true that I have asked you to put this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - one could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as the former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Employment Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin had come to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted in most .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president &apos;s second term president of Russia , since a third term of mandate exp@@ ired against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Put@@ ting , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President for three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he proposed producer
Gibson was involved in a physical conflict at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announces its termination in a shared opinion .
Gibson , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for publicly disclos@@ ed before the announcement of his termination .
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of the series , such as the character Gib@@ sons of the series , which is written by a team of FBI agent , will be released at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Greg had played since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Court Min@@ ds and I put my whole heart blo@@ t in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gibson in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hop@@ ed to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the twel@@ fth season finale will be scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of fish help , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act among the 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were donated by a fountain of fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fishes .
Queens@@ land Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the project will be completed by £ 1.@@ 35 billion to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Queens@@ land cross country with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now related to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four stops of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ lan@@ ted rop@@ es .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
the building site , Keith Brown , took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a work of engineering from a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , almost 79 % of all bridge de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a bet@@ ting for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to get off the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and low@@ land represents .
after the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the northern tower wall , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern Zu@@ er@@ brücke in 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very very delicate activity .
solid since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up by a gra@@ dient of approximately 3 % .
swing , because the toler@@ ances that the team worked , tiny were - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
luckily , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saving in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station defeated an event on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat was moving on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we be@@ held how the boat turned around and turned the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat down to their range until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging out without a li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board ship rescue routes and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engines had a stop @-@ stop , the bo@@ oting , however , def@@ ended the boat from the lo@@ ot of the boat from the person that was controlled by boat .
someone has wonder@@ ed today about these men .
seriously injured - man g@@ out on his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and injured .
as the police run yesterday , the 50 year old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff .
instead of non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when this came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice to them .
the 44 year old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
while the 50 year old destroyed his ex @-@ friend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished one of his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went with his compan@@ ions from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life of man .
when the two women again ro@@ asted the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old moved his sister to the site and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mean : investors are going to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how are you respon@@ ding to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; action concept &quot; to the next meeting session .
but dispute is programmed .
the first place is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are said to agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build urban areas , in the future , 20 percent of all flats have to be considered social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable housing can also occur in its continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the huge dispute in the town hall , however , says viol@@ ated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to build with investors facing private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such surfaces more than 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions of costs and will have to be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , says Viola : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few regulations .
the left does still want hardness editions for investors .
regardless of what , then Brat@@ mann , then a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear if we get the skilled workers .
yet the programme is not entirely covered : for around 12@@ 60 new homes , which should be built anyway .
but how is the loss of some more than 1,@@ 300 affordable housing that will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the spokesperson for planning , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city &apos;s ongoing commitment .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting apartments back into the price area .
this is possible in the western town .
solve the problem at one blow .
in the west city , at the end of the yearly Dead@@ lines run .
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner who don &apos;t want housing companies .
because the number of social apartments in the western town is dramatically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called perme@@ ating mixture is removed .
it shall not be a concentration of social weak in just a few city parts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they focused on more building sites for family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does not mean , however , that there may be a compromise possible .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that teen@@ ager and child do not go outside , but rather you prefer to spend their free time on screens , was lam@@ ented in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about bringing people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on the screen was initially set to the TV , then to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities not close any other in free .
I am taking myself of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later there were a cartoon animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
as many phenomena in popularity sun@@ k the interest in the release of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than t@@ issues and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons with a GPS , and once they were found once they were found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation which played the game when she was younger , joined the wreck and jum@@ ped out for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person goes back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35@@ ,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it simply sees the raw data for auction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns to take care of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take away from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get rid of the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa , because many public messages are d@@ ull on the health and come by people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to avoid cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that are too long to introduce them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in free that fun to them .
three pillars of health are covered - motion , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even close up new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical game @-@ destruc@@ tions , always to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk towards a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could follow our activity , they gave us no reason to practice sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use of time will be im@@ min@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality by activ@@ ating the real world and will help many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter , and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in the ladies

Simone Bal@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the ank@@ le horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on all line .
and now also the Olympic champion .
19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast invented the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &apos; -@@ Mann@@ our@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ ail@@ winner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig @-@ bal@@ m of the women &apos;s individual campaign at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ al is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ battle pit and a total of the fifth , while she ti@@ ghtened to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who have put their sports at new high@@ s :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es won the last three years domin@@ ating their sport , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold med@@ alists from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton , from her told she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The best Tur@@ ner@@ in is that I ever saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ le and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .

although it in@@ sist@@ ed on top of a long way to have never planned the future , this is not really true .
a part of their ground exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , was adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has never lost any event competition , a victory of victory that will continue so long as it wishes .

the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze wa@@ ist in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man trial , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her ground exercise , she designed the public c@@ ousin , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as it concerns , it has a completely new meaning for the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of murder while listening to music in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who had been killed in one of the most fatal attacks in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ers by Phoenix , while they heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle lin@@ ers , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s Dau@@ ghter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a single drive , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators mo@@ cked eight shots from a hand mo@@ ist , while standing on the front of the car , and then fled with another car , is to be read in the report .
the police stated that the tri@@ ke murder doesn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of an adult victims .
the polic@@ eman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the slides led the investig@@ ator to see if it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks , and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that attacks are linked to and out of the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was down on an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge he@@ els and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro @-@ ep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is getting better &quot;
like most 6 year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves to sing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its age , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I did not create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let me down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what does not correct at all -- you have settled it on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund Hillary cannot recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far , they struck him to institu@@ tional him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can walk with help of a walking remedy .
Edmund could neither sit still cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to sing and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth is the sign language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please click on me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring to him sign language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS news .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- she says . Edmund has invented some notes alone .
Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a multitude of causes : genetic as with Edmund and infections with viruses , such as Mas@@ ks or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how life is influenced by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ vol@@ ved .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds itself of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve ever asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis , because I do not expect it really can tell me any more .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects , which were caused by the Z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it will improve better .
they know they will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Louisiana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ area floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its sho@@ res and threatened with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rainy days , the national weather service reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards provided that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help to the localities concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , distributed that the requests for flood @-@ vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiplied .
Ste@@ am said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa has claimed ten thousand sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service rel@@ ates that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could be falling in this area .
the South of Al@@ ab@@ amas was a Fl@@ ut@@ e@@ war@@ n System on Friday , and it continues to rain in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both are in Louisiana , all probability of reaching over the weekend will reach a record level .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers may spread many houses to the past Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that an influ@@ x @-@ directed floods occur in Ascension Par@@ ish , as it is only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Kan@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Louisiana , on Friday , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue Team still p@@ ushes people from the flood in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were amongst those who were saved on Friday in the near of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly over night .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and po@@ uring the water and po@@ uring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never seen such stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members would have had all the disabled and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer saved them all three in a large military truck and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ves , where they were accommod@@ ated there until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretched out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities delay evacu@@ ation instructions into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server recorded near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was greatly increased by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities made that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding the residents of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and fra@@ ction were caused in five school districts .
the WW@@ L , the C@@ BS subsidiary , reported that 200 floo@@ ded homes floo@@ ded in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded homes .
the residents were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now floo@@ ded .
the ruler of the village Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven animals escaped from floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the Ev@@ acu@@ ity .
&quot; once the water starts going back , they will go back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa we have closed almost two dozens of streets because of floo@@ ding and brought sand@@ bags for the residents , who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city council .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison county said that it continues to ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday has been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday but were not announced on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; varn@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police co@@ inci@@ ded with that the 6 @-@ year old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week , this week became the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admit that Brown suffered various sh@@ ab@@ uses , including in the lungs , leg , arm and abs , but that he was at his transport to hospital with consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was extingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the child &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is expected to recover .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot by German@@ town .
there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front of a car together with the 29 year old , who is found in a critical condition , recorded in the broad@@ c@@ aster .
the other two victims were not in the car , and the police had just been determined to be found under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators given C@@ BS Philadelphia , with that it seems to be a be@@ acon between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge he@@ els for assault rif@@ le , which have been tra@@ ced back to various assault rif@@ le , rev@@ iled the crime scene .
it seems that it was clearly a pro@@ longed fight .
on the road , on both sides of the walk , they found themselves .
so it seems to have given several armed fighters here , who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police spy Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there came no ceremony and the police are currently reviewed reports , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross@@ bars on arm as she played before her house in the area of West Oak Lane .
she re@@ covers and police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imag@@ ined among the women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ nen , and that is more than a reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three tur@@ keys , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who insp@@ ire many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ist and Madison Ko@@ cian who is Cath@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has fixed the black and H@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , number one has been one of the female gymn@@ ast@@ ings an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this indicates strength .
on the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas welcomed a surprising Olympic team and che@@ ering .
now , the world was able to be witnessed incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but you do not see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ keys in the team . besides , that is the last year Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality shows that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Turner first place in private gymn@@ as@@ ium that will maintain by parents , who will come up by parents for training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner , and family ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ ast@@ ers lie in weal@@ thy suburbs , who can support the business .
in these clubs the Turner receive its total training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained her athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to insp@@ ire the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide a free and easily accessible gym training .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ ement of 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ ics in Harlem for about 15,000 urban yo@@ ungst@@ ers ( especially black and H@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer to the youth of high quality exercises that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination provides lifetime benefits to health and school@@ ing and professional success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration for this team , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the practice and that is great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team champion and thank you , hat@@ red her so many young girls with different background to start heal@@ thful , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ting &apos;s proposal have refused
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amend@@ ment of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Regist@@ rar , who vote in a vote , refused him .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans unveil@@ s a for@@ ci@@ bly to initi@@ ate the contract , allowing the N@@ HS to be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; which would be harmful to the employees and patients to be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ - and weekly working hours to improve the care of maintenance times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ ants conducted last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have reached the proposed contract as before serious concerns , in particular that it is going to heat the current staff crisis and to deal with all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group dropped by doctors in the new Treaty , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on behalf of the BM@@ A on resol@@ ving the dispute through talks during the government to take part in re@@ vocation , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened by Jerem@@ y Hunt just last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt now must act to lift the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance . &quot;
if he did not do this , then the assistance are made clear that they are willing to implement further labor measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an elev@@ ation of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , as n@@ urses and specialists were included in order to grant doctors to the strike string .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amend@@ ment to the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week wage for 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants which are subject to contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of N@@ HS Staff , called for the assistance of assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor policies achieve nothing of the only little ones , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , fo@@ ster and their families only concerned , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the commission of assist@@ ants and talked with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively on concerns regarding the prec@@ urs@@ or and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ y@@ ings .
employers would hope that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , education , mutual recognition of education , training holidays , health education , health education , health education and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of cardi@@ ac disease patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day medicine after the authorities recommended to submit more people for a longer period of time .
the inhibit@@ ing drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
regul@@ ating authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has a four @-@ year @-@ long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
regul@@ ating authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has a four @-@ year @-@ long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by gathering fatty acids in the arter@@ ial fires , forming the pads .
when the covering comes apart , it may cause blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
if blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it may flow through the blood stream and clo@@ gged the blood flow to the brain which causes stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ica , is distributed under the Bri@@ li@@ que &apos;s trade name , reducing this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg t@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Programme , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , one quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ red consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack .
by preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit .
the information on the efficacy and safety of t@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood pressure risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the design draft recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sen@@ za was last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government face because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to that widespread constitu@@ ency was ignor@@ ant in Muslim communities such as a devast@@ ating government report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacked the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have evidence of election abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corrupt matter of religious motives , said that the police should be allowed to set up bul@@ locks out of pol@@ ling plants to protect registered voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead to her identity in order to prove their identity .
at present a v@@ oter must call its name and address .
the report proposes un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person when they vote their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to local documents and decisions from un@@ official commis@@ sions or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud but also the municipal government is supposed to protect , protect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special Ele@@ mentary Court decided that the reig@@ ning mayor ad@@ versity to Rah@@ man after a lit@@ any and illegal practices of his ministry should be applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man could per@@ vert the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Cyprus way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had brought his critics with ra@@ cial and Islamic debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign led on the basis that it will be the reli@@ c duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a reflection , when one person cho@@ oses one another .
Sir Eric said that in all the country there were evidence of fraud .
in particular , he vo@@ iced al@@ ar@@ ming for the g@@ rie@@ ger@@ ate letter - when the older members of Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made multiple recommendations to clean the pol@@ ling system , including the desire of withdrawal , to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof has been established that pressure on vulner@@ able members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised to choose especially women and young people to choose especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ quet background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions such as such as &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider@@ ations concerning eth@@ nic@@ ities concerning eth@@ nic@@ ities and religion could not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist papers process to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot;
the report that is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in vom@@ iting will also require tough@@ er registration verification to prevent the down@@ stream of immig@@ ration and social concrete purposes .
consider options to ask voters in front of your choice .
do not use removable print on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limitation on applications for automatic letter selection .
prohibition against political activ@@ ist , complete letters and env@@ elop@@ es of letters elections .
the police give the authority to set inter@@ sper@@ ms about election stations .
a law change that was reli@@ eved of the Indi@@ ct@@ ment due to the re@@ pression of the People Act 1983 ( Economic Affairs Act 1983 ) .
photographer in election stations .
requirements that only English can be used in turn@@ tables ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensive training of training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters go in the box alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it aston@@ ish@@ ingly , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let fall there was no pen@@ alties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral Court has L@@ uta for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was found guilty by a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ ents of the Rath@@ geber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said , &quot; The Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is wearing a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of pol@@ ls and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic Champion in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except edge and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ agent of the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only one to compete with gold in this summer - at least not by its own Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give thanks to the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces dedicated to our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ unter and the Wolf : crew member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates double plat@@ former on the cycling track , many people found on the internet like a certain bow that could be called Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the crew member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the arc hit the mad@@ ness into the social media and gave to hear that he already wanted to hear from his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no considerable re@@ semb@@ lance , except for the facial hair , &quot; told Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he &apos;s a hand@@ some guy , so I lay it out as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the up@@ lifting simil@@ arity between UK &apos;s wide @-@ jum@@ per Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double tran@@ script for the Cuban American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hard@@ ly who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ cl@@ oned skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans was buried , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; at the same time .
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about others that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities
put theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter username declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter had an incredibly similar face and eyes .
another popular compar@@ ing Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that re@@ sembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC Com@@ mem@@ or@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his testimony that Chinese swi@@ mmer died as a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Donalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he s@@ warming its own opinion at the end of the 4x@@ 200m exemp@@ le s@@ wimm@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought into the comment team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
too excited , she went as a ste@@ w , and died like a pig .
thank you for this .

viewers in all Canada react quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; was like a pig died ? ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot does not have K@@ AP@@ I@@ ER@@ T that they were still on show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m exemp@@ le s@@ wimm@@ ers for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard with him to speak many of his speech .
Twitter users weren &apos;t looking back when they heard how un@@ susp@@ icious Byron Mac@@ Donald was
a other Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like shave . # attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broad@@ cast@@ ed via a bu@@ oy@@ ancy performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen form@@ ulation , it &apos;s sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with people who have responded to the comments on Twitter
the commentary box Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it that these statements were made and that it was made to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers yesterday night and ap@@ ologi@@ ze in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make one thing clear , Byron &apos;s comments is related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
however , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ fortun@@ ate selected form@@ ulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to just@@ ify his re@@ mark that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I did after the s@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I was looking forward to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and did not refer to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was int@@ ent and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark app@@ alled by woman who tried in the middle of business sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to look at , when a woman attracted their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to give shelter .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered them , she drew her out , and put them back to the shelf .
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , on .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she left the under@@ wear and left the shop without buying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants , drew her own ti@@ ghts and tro@@ users and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody was star@@ ing when they didn &apos;t like the trou@@ bles , which you obviously did not like them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , getting back and out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that they watched , or to think about the person that would buy under@@ pants , which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that anyone would take care of a person who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got involved , the employees tries to withdraw the garments from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of sub@@ h@@ osen , and find out that another woman she had touched and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of what is happening on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone &apos;s event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ceas@@ es
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer to you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to find out with armed inc@@ ense at the distance .
regardless of whether you approach from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn the e@@ wer for your c@@ ops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you can turn back from behind , you should turn your attack@@ er so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give yourself from the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before you face him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knees and turn the knees before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while preparing the weapon to him .
by attack@@ ers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
now lay the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and judge the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to do it Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is the saf@@ est on the saf@@ est way to make your money - unless you are not a Grand@@ master Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling Ian Wright for a travel guide &apos;s tongue to the dirty places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ r@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - giving some of the most dirty and most ek@@ est places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk pushed his train to a euro area , a yellow @-@ ring binder and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before emp@@ tied every object , it used an Lumin@@ ometer to show oneself and to show us what he is introduced .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , pull the flush with a pull @-@ pull , which was already used by thousands of others , may be totally revol@@ ting , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a mixer .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals on promoting intest@@ inal bacteria and their own health .
thank@@ fully , nothing left what he emp@@ tied , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things .
from public money to train stations up to flush buttons of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the film : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was just perfect for his call .
the only thing He refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its trial showed an Lumin@@ omet@@ rics of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the Lumin@@ omet@@ rics will be fresh washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop after their Lumin@@ omet@@ res was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ d produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial capacity at different locations such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I spoke in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not stop here , because it is aw@@ k@@ ingly listed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company receives Mr Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and immune systems .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that fascinating to look at and at the same time declar@@ es the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which we ended , that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in healthy health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide more information about an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who direc@@ ting the film , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; I should have lost my respect for Ian , when he showed some of the things that I have referred to , such as the ec@@ el@@ ly Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to put them , and others in which it was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty delic@@ ac@@ ies on film . &quot;
in a survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all question@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria present in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ inal and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products that contained l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social Family Dest@@ ru@@ ction Del@@ og@@ nom@@ ination in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a delay with a damage of £ 50,000 because it wre@@ cked their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
having been removed from their property , shocked employees found their property in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls instru@@ cted cra@@ ck@@ les holes , wood panels were sliced , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated at the walls .
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears not to repair the apartment anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably not considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who were now living in the apartment , and the police said that the terror which the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ ches and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cious behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in circumstances , age was cast away
they were traded in the property where they were traded in the past of drugs called wooden legs .
neighbours said that they saw them on the street , and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ined her and her partner these week viol@@ ently from the property , after they gave them a extended period of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender .
the del@@ etion were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours that told her life to hell .
one told me , &quot; They sh@@ ook no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say , the police are saying here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was a family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the church , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it abh@@ ors the ten@@ ant to adop@@ t any responsibility for their behavior and to their family as a delay is always the last step that is taking Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult to look aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , which are brave to us and have provided us the information we have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope this development will don@@ ate consol@@ ation , and the message convey@@ ed that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cious behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress lined in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ aying on the ground
workers of the in @-@ house administration are now dispos@@ ed of rub@@ ber@@ gs , which surround the house
in 2014 , police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after she had found herself guilty of the possession of a drug B in trading vision .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after being without hom@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room @-@ walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti by gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that she will del@@ ve mi@@ red , who will not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row distributed by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that Del@@ og@@ nom@@ ination is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who can be@@ have without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as those who have been damaged by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ cious behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our churches .
tourists in Portugal moved to Pan@@ ik , after transfer@@ ring a ti@@ ghtly closed military jet beach
sun@@ ba@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3C Orion aer@@ op@@ lane of the Air Force put an incredible crash flight
the Air Force sent that it was on a training trip , but had to wait for a security threat .
this was the moment when sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after a ti@@ gh@@ ing jet is crashing on a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military aircraft flew almost in tan@@ gible near the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holidays rose , when they under@@ stand@@ ably started to make wor@@ ries about the noise of the de@@ bu@@ oy@@ ancy engines , without seeing all of what they came through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted the videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in panic , when the aircraft flew from darkness and was incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces gave us today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and so deeply I had to know that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet because of the bad visibility was somewhat lower than usual , however , the air@@ planes used to wait for any time at any time .
area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces gave us today that the pilot had to fly through the rati@@ os - strong fog and fire - so deeply he had to limit its point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plane was on a training trip to identify the pilot &apos;s fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans enter the Du@@ eling around the Spanish Super@@ cup at the FC Sevilla , which goes back three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner has to do with the su@@ ck@@ ling cup@@ fin@@ alists and the ruling Europa League Champion , amongst others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who dispute the Olympic football tournament in Brazil .
Moreover , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is also missing .
during the training session of Claudio Bravo , the German War was at least the first step in the training of Bar@@ ca at least until the signing of Claudio Bravo .
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen compete in Barcelona for two years , around the status as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique did so far back on a clear decision and made Bravo in the League , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen took the advance in most of the other applicants .
before the first mandatory play of the new season there is dou@@ bts about the fitness level of the crew , which was hum@@ ili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ s@@ als against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co did not really convince .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup at Real Madrid to di@@ gest and stre@@ amed the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with previously eleven successes of a record winner in this competition .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ pe@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
this was clear that for the third time a Chinese single title would take a single title in the signs of five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they moved back to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their shel@@ ters in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat@@ s until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I was for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ hang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really wanted to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first sentence .
then set off the pace on the board and let Z@@ hang down there for a total of 13 points .
the expected match did not develop by the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma .
yet we were not satisfactory to see stunning bal@@ lo@@ ons .
Miz@@ pe@@ ani won the game around bronze with the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Weiß@@ rus@@ el had excav@@ ated a squ@@ ee@@ zing in a medical treatment , &quot; ultimately , &quot; conclu@@ ding with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump grants &quot; tremendous problems ″ on election campaign
the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans leadership is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive complic@@ ity as well as traditionally conservative federal states .
the presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave his election to his election campaign in the rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment , in which the Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is usually obvious and confident , such correspon@@ dent correspon@@ dent report .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the dou@@ bts rise up on his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame the false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his familiar media back .
rep@@ ubli@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ les
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his conclusions from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , simultaneously .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by far the distance that rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates are common in the federal state .
there are also Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answered the question how he would stop again to stop Clin@@ tons , &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he do nothing other than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
if it is not enough for him in the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is in order , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump threatened to paint funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better question@@ able .
instead , one wants to make the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to be stronger among the arms .
Olympia : sc@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary Commission to the event .
Kenya &apos;s athl@@ ates threat@@ ens the Second D@@ oping Aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ dar@@ ach Olympic Games .
after a fraud test at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee was assigned to al@@ locate a disciplinary committee immediately to investig@@ ate the case .
a Ken@@ yan func@@ tionary has told that the former Sprinter and modern coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , was given a urine test in the Olympic village , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported that the Ken@@ yan team management has been reported by D@@ oping Control@@ lers .
the IA@@ AF world association has created the IO@@ C for information about the case to follow its own resear@@ ches , a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping Control Station and signed as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , which was released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the Ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ doping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup quarter more than 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athlet@@ ics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he shall have informed about cash payments from his country via upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
after a long time , Kenya has been under special observation for the IO@@ C after numerous D@@ oping clubs .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 D@@ oping rules before the Rio Olympics , un@@ used to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia could be taken into the visor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world anti @-@ doping agency had lots of pressure on African country to create an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law has been adopted a few weeks before the Olympia Start .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose doping control shape are associated with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a large runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the majority of medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
in a series of TV reports the ARD was repeatedly collected , that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he was employed in the Russian athlet@@ ics role .
thereby , it could be proved that in this sport , systematic and system@@ atically controlled .
Russia &apos;s ren@@ ditions were subsequently excluded by the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival highlights the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ al Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ te Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a bit older than Maria .
she re@@ members wor@@ m@@ wood with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally outstanding !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and hum@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she re@@ sembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist full of praise for oper@@ ability : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is a hu@@ gely generous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an exceptional artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you can see it in every of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a joy@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we left the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ ies went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
these are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; those who don &apos;t fit and Erdogan is engaged , sits on caught suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Constitu@@ ent of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
at the short term , Kurdish Community Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seeking to flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; belie@@ ving Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass acc@@ urs@@ or to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the short term , I anticip@@ ate tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany in the medium term , when the Erdogan regime is fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Vice President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had previously covered Kurdish high bur@@ gh@@ s with imp@@ ec@@ tions , 500,000 ds of Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run .
following the led put@@ sch &apos;s cheese , sec@@ ular and opposition ethnic Turks are added .
many will re@@ start in Europe if they will continue to be op@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes refuge in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the government def@@ ended Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ an cities .
that will increase Erdogan &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ ation to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already extinct in the past hundred years or distributed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal President asked that the federal government is &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . &quot;
in Germany , there is a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critic .
in the last months I did not feel for the first time in Germany anymore .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition leaders .
the fire mark as the Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destroyed teachers and other graduates the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and Erdogan is engaged in stirring suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Education , the Turks had already reported the biggest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution .
at the reporting date June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all recognized as as@@ yl have been recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , there are not pla@@ ited from war , poverty or f@@ law@@ less@@ ness .
asylum entit@@ les according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the governmental side , individual persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ships from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia to not choose the parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as so far , it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and farm combat - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election campaign , are on vacation .
most of the tourists that are on the land , Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are hel@@ per , infl@@ ating posters , distribute flyer , spread fl@@ yers and end up with the end of the vote .
until September 4 , 2016 , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern &apos;s vote in the election and last festival day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to be over for the people over the past .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , lies in the pol@@ ls only behind the CDU .
what is exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of coalition fac@@ tor@@ ments .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ icious election campaign , one sees his major posters .
he travels through the country , spread ros@@ es and chat with people , as it did already its legendary word @-@ kar@@ er predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors get cold feet and pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel at AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the credits , which is likely to cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with their nick@@ name , the Minister of Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she was invited to Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel is a parliamentary circle in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ke , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad anyone else from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU decreased largely to the common constitu@@ ency and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; under@@ stand@@ al role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that it was ob@@ sol@@ ete on the country , that it must be very strict to find a wire back to the people .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , barely there in the times of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CDU campaign Kok@@ ert on his fellow cont@@ est@@ ants , however , is also self @-@ derived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to go there where human beings are : Dor@@ m@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , each birthday party must be used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Social Democrats were last only 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and only just ahead of the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had still won with 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Klein@@ part@@ y , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should make the jump in the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e in the holidays of emergency and disp@@ ose of its constitu@@ encies in the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; calls it the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green constitu@@ encies in search ensu@@ ite search for local votes among tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the nick@@ name di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ vy just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; elec@@ toral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
at speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the responsibilities of the construction , at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise to be praised .
&quot; they did everything pretty tough , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells about the jet gas station .
that is a super@@ team .
there is no default either .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south end of the weekend until the end of October should be completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will also comm@@ end the opposite to the construction work , for example when it comes to set up Beh@@ ind passes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was w@@ ander@@ ed on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and again the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has once again been relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again on both sides .
ev@@ as@@ ion through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Director of the Management Board responsible for Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ac@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schl@@ eich@@ wege were searching and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
so , what led to some people to spend some truck in residential areas .
since the Speed limit has not been kept , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable ab@@ uses , &quot; says King that made herself any location above the situation .
two to three per minute has been lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was at 77 kilometres per hour in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has passed on , it was never qui@@ eter .
for the business people at B 27 there is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers of Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ restoration has led to revenue in them with sales , everybody who asks you will look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have &quot; less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; for other companies , has hardly any consequences for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decrease &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also grants that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most explo@@ ited are the local restaurants .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
that is already existed .
not only him , but all of them have met it hard . &quot;
they were missing the clients of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and R@@ ott@@ weil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
sales revenue represents &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking took his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turned back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could be a financial compensation , otherwise indicated by the benefits of the location on the B . now she also benefited the dis@@ advantages to carry out through the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
for other regular traffic control , other regular traffic management is less frequently rec@@ alled , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else .
that his pedi@@ gree returns to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and birds , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers &quot; biggest crisis that has experienced its place in its long history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
in the name of counter @-@ terrorism in laws is supp@@ ressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère put now a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has an effort to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ iti@@ oning say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of his proposals are political , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of State at the launch of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not ur@@ ge anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also concerned about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Interior , he is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ sens@@ us con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to store before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
these are now more comprehensive reasons for this .
some is already known , proclaimed , told , that a new security authority must take care of the cra@@ cker encryption , is not new .
this is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and ceas@@ e@@ fire .
the offer for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals which had not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck the jihadists with double citizenship to the German Pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CDU @-@ man .
nevertheless , he still uph@@ eld this for sen@@ sible and demands nothing , which at Ko@@ al@@ iti@@ an doesn &apos;t have a chance .
some new ideas presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
those have partially in itself : he plans rapid @-@ method for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the arrest of people prior to deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically into the country should check their smartphone before and expos@@ e social media accounts for a security test .
at Dul@@ ces for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to set out some more bad than such that off@@ ences or un@@ aware of their Pap@@ ers to dis@@ gu@@ ise their identity .
some of them is political and legally holy .
some even seem un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - with im@@ patient treatment of patience for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
many people are worried about safety in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply hurt themselves did not let compl@@ ain about in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the accommodation in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the he@@ dging is large .
and yes , there are election fights .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly focusing on inner safety .
in the past few days , there was high between both parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky stri@@ fe about the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a safety state Minister of Interior Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also call for a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and a revers@@ al of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère ought also to be reconc@@ iled to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a departure from the double pass he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
we have satisfactory the discussion in Germany .
she &apos;s new to do , don &apos;t make sense .
and on a Bur@@ ka ban he has been constitutional .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show itself only .
there &apos;s a lot in what could cause dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing an inner safety subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first time to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is even worse by Volkswagen .
despite diesel clients , the delivery costs are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the retri@@ ev@@ ing action there is vort@@ ex about a concept .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year for deliveries to deliveries .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to mark a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW posted its overall sales market particularly in Western Europe and thus secured the total sales of the company in the D@@ ax companies .
in July , the brand , VW , sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
by China alone , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year .
in the home market Germany , the deliveries around almost one sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned the weaker numbers from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been given a department store . &quot; &quot; &quot;
along with the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the exit from the EU decided to explain a speaker .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ aff@@ aires first escal@@ ated , is also a minus of beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the affected house brand of Lower Saxony is further increased by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
Group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was further pointing out to a sales office from January to July .
Volkswagen produces 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of car manufacturer after the upgrade is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t talk from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal experts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen won a guarantee of diesel models for its German customers now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the traffic department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vari@@ ances will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry of Minist@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that the fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the conversion cannot be increased , and all the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate affairs .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen provides the opportunity for example a half year after upgra@@ ding , for example , to carry with a motor damage in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage caused nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that with some other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal to have a violation of possible warranty conditions , as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , I use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity in future pen@@ di@@ aries - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is just about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on bank or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single incident and sees in it no signal : normal aspar@@ agus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need to be afraid to pay for their savings pen@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks account money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund back from September of private and corporate clients for deposits via € 100,000 to bank or day money .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he jumps for some time 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the others and that he could not be conc@@ e@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are lying with me on the central bank account and create 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of Banking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up to 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
the cost will now continue according to the par@@ ach@@ ment principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply ran into the sp@@ urs of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four accidents , I may not like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers could have understanding and changed to other cards .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Soviet Union declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy on the ECB causes significant costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their charges for bank account , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Land and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burg had made head@@ lines with its doors for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits , with the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is a client , which is a little l@@ ush from wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free for money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ah @-@ E@@ likes , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , famous actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ operative Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ operative is not currently known any other banks that comp@@ ute an offset rate for in@@ sol@@ es of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German Federation of German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had stated late June , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives towards the private client , is very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .

in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des of hob@@ bies - it has an emotional importance : older plat@@ former don@@ ors keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .

if this blog has been a news report on TV , I would follow my camera , while I remain in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild , before I stick to keep my hands and keep a little effort like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a close look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look on it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vend@@ ors were based , there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the camera man to place the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow by Sister Ray ( number of people : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of people , a woman , probably around the 20 ) is one day because of the meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; I guess so , &quot; he says .
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound panels , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a si@@ z@@ able number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates which he could not afford to buy , when he sold , when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was too young to buy them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es to those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets to apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the medi@@ as , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have promp@@ ted to purchase their old records again .
of the talks that I managed , people usually have def@@ ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica in order to recognize that record shops offer a soo@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers joined the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sil@@ encer , from objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ations .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be filling a void , or the property of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; WE@@ Z said .
that is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to employ intellec@@ tu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a band stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this point of news , I would probably look very worried , while I leaf@@ ed through a st@@ acks to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( SNB data : three men mean age ) has been working , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here and said , &quot; I own no record player but I would like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them to the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product heavy , less musicians .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are getting slow .
F@@ opp , which has devoted a whole floor to the record , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , the photos make , teen@@ agers and women medium age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tet Pop instead of speakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to determine when you stand for about 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates for sale .
she rather gives a show@@ down as a big one .
she doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting of records is no real option , it says .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of plat@@ ters is ... it drives up with a lovely si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired : urban outfit .
while I confess the je@@ ans hot@@ spot , I watch a group of young teen gem@@ s that join for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , essential boards for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to address them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry , and some customers can send to the depths of Soh@@ o , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money , is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ join forces .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their th@@ urs@@ day tomorrow with security not with the stroll through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while it with@@ stands the ga@@ ze of an in@@ conc@@ e@@ erie , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who e@@ ats over the shoulders nothing of an intermediate age .

French court den@@ jects offer over demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a quotation from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during the hearing of this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais claimed that the state should be authorised to settle down 72 provisional shops , in which persons offer shopping services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be torn down because they would not include a parallel economy , from which no taxes were paid and they have a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the dish that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups that would not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they led out that the temporary shops and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who run the 72 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provisional shops &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a lot more important than people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that areas of calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , the non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English , French and French coun@@ sel@@ ing for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of migrants had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - according to a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must focus on the next generation of speed settings : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , the tem@@ ples should be especially effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to gentle bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary base for compliance with speed limit .
a durable mobile construction can however be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days , the case data is encrypted using a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded at the same time with laser measuring technology .
variable speed lim@@ iting and travel connections to time , timet@@ able and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a highly used state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with a trailer h@@ itch .
so that he is not simply reduced , it is lowered by the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the pan@@ ick@@ ed and by the way also f@@ us@@ eless outside .
in addition , an integrated alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities too flash@@ ed with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold cat@@ ches
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day Rug@@ by came in final on Thursday evening at a ab@@ rupt stop at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when she was beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji divided a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ st@@ ping , desc@@ end , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ac@@ aille of any color .
the defeat was scor@@ ned by the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day might fall back to the final .
but if this form , Fiji could have put a 15 @-@ man team in top form .
it might be a sol@@ ace for UK - but it will probably not be that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chef Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
the GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , she lost under Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this folder will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and made the attacks spring off having fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in Co . when you run in travelling buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with more than four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added a further attack on the right corner of which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a violent ti@@ ck@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a saw a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the resur@@ gence and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u prec@@ eded by further weak ti@@ gh@@ lings of the UK Team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is like Fiji had been born to play 7 , while the GB is still missing .
it is so too .
GB carried out basic changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nort@@ on started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the southern s@@ lan@@ ders , whose fans flo@@ ats , flags , and dancing on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it wasn &apos;t difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i bag dot with another try in the last few seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le pointed , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the GB kno@@ cked down beaten decis@@ iv@@ ely in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 conquered and Britain pushed South Africa into a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion to the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ ok@@ s in the first half of the front , but Dan Nort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive leg work and scored a goal under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late te@@ ar@@ ling from Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ AS@@ IDE team , secured the win - and the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no engines of engine than those games , and that wants to be .
from the first rowing machine to the last , 220 hard sh@@ ie@@ ve , which go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
although it were only those who were sitting at the rud@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams was all present as she named for the second Olympics in suc@@ cession , the first women in the history of British Sports , who used such a scale .
her dom@@ ination was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter is an un@@ strug@@ gling deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ ons that reflect on the surface of the elegance of s@@ warf , which is not reflected in the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind every gold in rowing , there &apos;s a batt@@ ali@@ on on content to make the difference and it was no one @-@ conscious than the trainer , who would not survive this day before it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able , and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads anywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky enough to be at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , out of the season , in case that the break was at least the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even larger one .
in the in@@ medi@@ ation of victory her first thought went to Williams , who spent a anno@@ ying morning so doing something more than usual , trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was as cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much as I mean , how much I and Helen and also worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I could not have a better person to coaching or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no races during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the past 500 meters , when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were tra@@ pped very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , just stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take out for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ port .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the general manager of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ n assembly group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian well . &quot;
a small w@@ ailing drinking water @-@ purpose band as a model for large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original post in a post by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken claimed the purpose of the two .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; Bavarian as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller who was 31 years in the purpose of staff , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association with seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for further cities and municip@@ alities there are water supply contracts .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remembered that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and has been appointed the Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ck@@ shof in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance activities across office and organis@@ ational activities , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land of land in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and re@@ modelling of water pipes .
it did not have a stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations because water is cover and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio she pra@@ ising G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used much warmth for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived in the water @-@ purpose and it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he as a real pract@@ iti@@ oner gave the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gs to nit@@ rate cover before the Water Forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller brings together water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who had worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best sk@@ e@@ eper and he was a loyal b@@ out .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he drew the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the pipe bur@@ gl@@ ary in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages with water could be supplied .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n could only be maintained once , because you filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ ne@@ sts .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who succe@@ eds from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot dead in a family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday , and she was wounded .
&quot; the man called herself up and stated to have shot his personal compan@@ ions , &quot; said a polic@@ eman .
the perpet@@ rators be on the run , and after him I will be publicly disclos@@ ed .
meanwhile Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ az@@ ze .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
however , it &apos;s a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ ac@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in himself , the police .
who Sven S. sees to call the 110 .
the police says of a &quot; relationship &quot; .
the sacrifice was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to make data between the perpet@@ rators and the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ mit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said a police officer in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , it was a special police force ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - View for German steel industry
the explo@@ ited and energy @-@ corrosive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of height .
financial loads , which are threatened by the industry , are threatened by the table .
it remained in the liberation of renewable energy circulation systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to put the steel manufacturers , the gases coming from the blast furnace for power generation , for making your own consumption .
according to German industry associations , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate of EU Commission pursuant to talks with compet@@ iti@@ veness of Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only when the generators will be replaced in the steel structures , all an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall had welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the EU Commission on its own power .
thus the status Quo will be re@@ written to the current regulation .
special importance have the successful artwork of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the reform of the emission decision , climate and employment goals are to be weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall by Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ lays and considerable pricing since the 2008 financial crisis .
last year , the situation escal@@ ated , as the world @-@ largest producer of China has grown steadily on the world market due to the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
over the spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for one show , in@@ fusion oil on import steel effect , for the other , economic prospects in China have ste@@ ered up .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price will be .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ously on Thursday .

the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost savings .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de even closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 0,000 people were employed by the end of 2015 in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic association ste@@ ep@@ ed in steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the second quantity returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
the association anticip@@ ates an increasing job position thanks to improved order conditions in the coming months .
community , mind , health : sing the sen@@ iors good
the singing is accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already with her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , sitting in the teaching position , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balance , cheerful and a whole living , says she .
by this way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is like a great hobby for sen@@ iors , he says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in choir and co @-@ minded the joy of the music , describes hack@@ ers .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for frequently , social and family structures are frequent , then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrange and organize , learning and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says hack@@ ers .
because the sen@@ iors practice a deep and controlled breathing .
who demands his lungs regularly , does not get in everyday life so quickly out of the pu@@ zz@@ iness .
even if it comes to maintain the sound of voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour community of senior citizens .
in the older generations the common singing had a high priority value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly persons raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth period .
lyrics and especially melodies dem@@ n @-@ related people at long past events .
while singing the head , a special power is required , L@@ enz explains .
simultaneously , to focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not just prac@@ tise on themselves .
another positive aspect is recognition , which drives by singing in chorus , says hack@@ ers .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through the singing in chorus .
to show himself : if I do for something , I get better and watch beyond me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to begin with S@@ ingen , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate then - even if he means a little talent , reveals L@@ enz .
you are not singing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening to a sound beside it ?
in search of the right offer senior citizens have various ways , says hack@@ ers .
if anyone sings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle in an elderly par@@ ench@@ y@@ or , you can simply connect .
many towns also offer over the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
he who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical chorus can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many volunteer cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
who has no access to internet , your family , friends or neighbours will ask for help with the Internet .
who desire to sing , should join a choir , reveals hack@@ ers .
sing the soul very well and has a sense of liberation - this is true for every age .
cats react sensitive as tom@@ cats on scre@@ ams of young animals
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect of cat &apos;s cats has grown on adult animals .
at her surprise , the male was also not cold . however , they always looked at the difference to the females .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ al level of cats at the Mi@@ auen &apos;s of the little ones .
they react just ten percent faster on Lau@@ tle of K@@ ittens born in large trouble as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the k@@ ittens of K@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ wing of less and strongly ar@@ ous@@ ed young are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author@@ itarian study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens was different with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
a total of nine adult cats and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H in total .
they were played for a pack of babies who were taken out of the saus@@ ages for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
secon@@ dly , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ ittens , which were additionally lifted up .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample @-@ sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she turned out faster to the loud@@ speakers , when this bu@@ ff played the very great k@@ ittens .
this ability may be canc@@ eled or developed with sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises .
some studies show that women responded sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
it is accused of being a member of the terrorist group .
after the attempt at the coup attempt in Turkey , an important soccer game is taking place in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before Du@@ eling the Erz@@ riv@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business as usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the exp@@ iry of the extra@@ dition request in July , the government accord@@ ed the everyday life of normal alb@@ ac@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the In@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
in addition there is no content even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
therefore , in America , the South Cau@@ r is being accused of being a member of the terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is supposed to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
although this is valid for 90 days , however , until October , the state of most Turks , however , has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sports is - like the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and ad@@ vers@@ aries .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ic@@ tas are traditionally not amongst the friends of the President .
but what the anger of Turks en@@ acted in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
even the fans even agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ Winner &quot; Gala &quot; it is going to arrive especially to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
in the last season the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first play as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all cont@@ ests .
in the final play against fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the paper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; acc@@ laimed : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup of poker .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the disappo@@ inting season for the record master found a concili@@ atory conclusion .
after the first @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; differ@@ ed early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the playing year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who provided the basis for the 14 titles with 26 seasonal ten@@ den@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ al@@ ot .
this is also the reason that fans will continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in the case of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had only announced his bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez following the attemp@@ ted attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario is willing to come to us , he must say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the falls would have to be willing to do without a third of its annual revenue of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still medals for Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for Dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ owa should not start in Rio .
other survived athlet@@ ics sin@@ ner can only laugh at it - they &apos;re fighting in Rio by medals .
the topic D@@ oping determined as before the head@@ lines for the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping lock , just before playing , was pushed out with their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess and spread out .
it was a sk@@ il@@ an@@ ile scenario : she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are numerous further sports@@ men who go to the start despite D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversial figures in the athlet@@ ics category .
he was locked up for d@@ op@@ ings twice ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
since its spell , the 2004 Olympic Champion and Ex @-@ world champion runs more quickly than before , he is number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two times world champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock , after receiving the pain of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

Per@@ kovic suffered the sent@@ in@@ ous in@@ gest@@ ion and was blocked for six months .
the most common lit@@ ters will go to the account of the great gold favorite in this year .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ rit ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 metres , was tested positively and closed 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ rit .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( H@@ ammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Championship title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with him testosterone levels .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give up Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 based on a decision of the International Sports Court of Justice .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked # two of the World Ranking List .
Liu Hong ( 20 km Go , China ) : the world record and gold favorite in May has only been tested positively in May , but may still be started in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships of world championship were found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ doping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran off on 13 July .
bomb ror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had suffered arms and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she planned her home journey for early September .
whether from another explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in permanent contact with local authorities , so schn@@ au@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bombs .
according to police , a copy of Thailand were killed and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday night two jumps went up high , a further person was killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
near the Det@@ onation in the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police data .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban staff .
the explo@@ sives has come to the air according to the authorities in front of the territory of the territory of the territory .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations demanded on Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions of Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ bers carry the same manuscript , &quot; said armies defeated Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s too early to express itself to possible motives - this is probably the action of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that typical for the bom@@ bers of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , however , stated that attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is assumed that bombs have been laid by the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ y references to the south of the country last days - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group is still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police reported their officials in all the country , security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they mostly do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the ration@@ ale explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office recommends to work on his homepage , the instructions of Thai Security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ per and its surroundings .
following disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , the necessary trips are not necessary in these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday had completed a few days following a controversial referendum on the Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were a try to make chaos , while the country moves towards stability , to improve the economic situation and tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody up@@ heav@@ al , is feeling good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the military did not succeed in order to get into the grip for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , in Bangkok , a bombing of a popular Hindu @-@ shr@@ ine had killed 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised in the visor of the Federal Office for Constitu@@ tional conservation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial hospitals , the constitu@@ tions under observation have also provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ tional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we are watching the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of your own identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Constitu@@ tional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity cards &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely alig@@ ned with the provincial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extrem@@ ists are trying to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the affected Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ sex@@ ist .
this is not an app@@ alling advertising for its own thing .
the propaganda should be emotion@@ ally addressing the people .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
last year , from several federal states , we had given reports of the &quot; identity &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no findings .
for the constitutional protection , the possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , AF@@ D - by certain people , which are extrem@@ ist , changes its targets , and so extrem@@ ist .
thus , such persons can be contributed to the party to control such people .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view of the clear increase of ri@@ ot@@ iv@@ ated off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee families said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak with new right terrorism .
but we have established in recent years that there can be legal gu@@ er@@ ror@@ ist structures .
there were &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be certain that further right @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups const@@ itute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee attacks or attacks from other right @-@ sex@@ ist motives .
but it is not recogni@@ z@@ able either in the wide or European control of right @-@ terrorism .
the previous groups were created on regional level or in social networks .
worried about how many survi@@ ves went to the account of people who had previously appeared in the right scene in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodations were not known as criminal , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , previously used with right @-@ right trem@@ ors , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who however have radic@@ ally radic@@ alized by right @-@ wing trem@@ ors . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the head@@ lines of Olympic Games or world records .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Summer Olympics .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he couldn &apos;t see more in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neck was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ its was then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a reg@@ ression of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athlet@@ ic figure that drew attention to the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old did not participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right by the international floating band .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ merged countries known .
because in eth@@ opia the most sports@@ men walk , Hab@@ its just wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
the first top sur@@ names make the lap quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he just talked with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters of Freist@@ il , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run for media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea as it had to compete in an attempt at 100 meters of Freist@@ il alone .
f@@ ren@@ etic was fired at M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks to a presidential campaign in Florida .
if so , with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then put into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential election in November , it would be a matter of matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it will be either open , or I have a very , very beautiful , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the candidate of rep@@ ubli@@ can in an telephone interview with the CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not sufficient for him in the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he described US President Barack Obama and the can@@ did@@ acy in demo@@ cra@@ t , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist state of Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance were formed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go to the third party sales , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months , whether they are shipped to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Scooter , with the letters and pack@@ ets should also sell to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der had said it &apos;s time to ask , about craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly rise to mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ own factory plan the company plan construction of up to 10,000 cars a year and shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group will significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and rop@@ es in the long term a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said late July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Scooter has been active in Germany since 2014 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of re@@ structure are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last ill G@@ RP business numbers , each shareholder will become un@@ ste@@ ady sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ pped in cor@@ um@@ m@@ ns in dit@@ ch : eight injured
with an accident of 43 sen@@ iors as a passenger bus , there were eight people injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ n ( District of Aur@@ I ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , and shared the police .
the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach must according to an accommo@@ dating lung , which drove part in the counter @-@ way .
the bus came down to the right from the road and turned into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , persons could not leave the bus self @-@ employed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ usually travelers were brought back from a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ries and possible witnesses to report with the police .
the charges per cubic metre of se@@ wage from 1 October 2016 for the area of san@@ itation Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare was 2.@@ 10 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ enberg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , se@@ wer@@ age fee will then further increase when appropriate improvements are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation the waste price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was established during the approval of the household by the Land@@ council with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that it was exposed for these w@@ ast@@ age installations .
on the basis of legal foundations , Kas@@ endorf is committed to maintain the facilities compli@@ ments .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ châ@@ tel , Az@@ endorf , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lind@@ enberg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to make a deep breath in the money &apos;s bags .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as the executive director Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new circulation of charges for waste water air@@ fields was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and including covers from the previous cal@@ ci@@ ation period shall be at the same time .
the gra@@ vest@@ ing increases increases in order to fly with all three w@@ ast@@ e@@ water systems by relatively small san@@ itation with a very low se@@ wage case , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres a year .
due to the low distribution basis for example , expenses for a necessary repair of several thousand Euros would be engraved .
the waste disposal in all three plants is slightly lower .
in the past cal@@ ci@@ ation period at all three plants , not least because of their age of rehabilitation and repair applications in a considerable extent .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged because of a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pum@@ ped world the company had to over@@ take the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems from the ground up and during the pond l@@ ur@@ ran@@ ger L@@ opp had to dispos@@ ed after almost 20 years of operation the first ten@@ derness , which dispos@@ es of an additional ventilation option , to keep the water legal requirements in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to these extraordinary expenditure , the continued support and maintenance costs were to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to power costs which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation during the previous years of 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that the small w@@ ast@@ e@@ water in the three systems had the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
thereby , Schmidt , the market leader of great entertainment costs , had been spar@@ ed throughout the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned grounds will continue to remain pre@@ dict@@ ated , especially as to continue to expand the utility area of the waste @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al by these facilities , because it is a consistent facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter has inspired An@@ ime , but some ob@@ servers say it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , take Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily exercises that change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are in@@ hib@@ ited , independent , autonomous tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ ections per day .
all patches are to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn cr@@ iti@@ que in the past , where they were accused of the app Black@@ face promoted or her white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as this week , some U@@ ses proposed a filter that gave them sacrifices , false teeth and un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated che@@ eks , there was some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversi@@ es on a bigger problem said that the company has di@@ ver@@ eign@@ ty .
the news and the in@@ dig@@ nation were extended on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after snap@@ chat , that it could be disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , ra@@ cial ver@@ us experienced , rem@@ inded of the filter to vulner@@ able c@@ lich@@ és .
others ass@@ orted the An@@ ime comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et became widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ating and m@@ ild@@ ly said un@@ pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the contrast of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not safe , but the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ lowing was removed .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling tournament .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration combat , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and take Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience young people - those in breed different than their older opponents - could be expected to go out sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a picture produced for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s much harder to notice that such things were un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for media to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a phone interview she said that rac@@ ite @-@ related Con@@ tr@@ usses reflect a lack of diversity in the employment practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the big part white , only male leaders and ended their essay by h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either do they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin paints that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or ben@@ evol@@ ent to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely abandoned un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for diversity of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , follow the Snap@@ chat on Thursday , discuss@@ ing the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has focused a personnel responsible for civil groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military command for@@ ci@@ dent ISIS Secret Services , Pres@@ ents Committee of Congress
military personnel in the United States Central Command changed consideration to rati@@ fy an optimistic picture of war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , when it had allowed actual conditions on site , a report of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the rep@@ ubli@@ can members of the Armed Forces Revolu@@ tionary Committee , reported by a great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret service anal@@ ysts who reported how proph@@ ec@@ ies changes the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news Rec@@ ur@@ ation of Cent@@ Com typically ar@@ ous@@ ed , typically a positive picture of the American efforts led against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article reviews . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; exhibited Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com ranges up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows significant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct references to change the government peaks under Obama orders , it shows how anal@@ ysts often saw the pressure from their laws , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many central Command press releases , opinions and statements against the congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; presented the report .
for example , an Cent@@ Com family publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the middle of the year 2014 up@@ to the middle of 2015 , the peaks of Central Command changed the following reports to play the threat by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them being played that anal@@ ysts want to worry about the mani@@ pulation of reports from the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are further underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
Democratic members of the con@@ scientious objec@@ om@@ in@@ ees published its own findings on Thursday which co@@ inci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has made an over@@ moder@@ ately restricted process for preparing surveys on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest ranking Democrats in the Kom@@ som@@ ee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ con@@ scientious reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was too little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ c@@ rats said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no evidence of the White House near Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts agree on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the Pentagon &apos;s New York Times reported by investig@@ ating the Pentagon , who were admitted to complaints from Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
according to Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a report of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress that the Defence Staff was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ ver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that now is made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the past year have rejected the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for the in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism about the Islamic State remind of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , than an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker sum@@ mon@@ ed up the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and a little time on it to face the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ kers announced that contrary to the statements of government officials , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group would have taken place because these provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ &apos;s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ative for his excessive positive assessment of the war at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US winning fourth match in the hockey world championship , show@@ down a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India that the Americans have won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who kept their goals in memory .
she knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equ@@ is@@ able in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will match the first round on Saturday in the final match .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams in their group will win the first and second place within their group .
the first placed will take a little bit longer out of the way that leads the other group .
as always the game likes to go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising thing by their success story , four years after she landed with the last London Games on the last 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey girl in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years ago she became a national player in the USA .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , since she was not able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , and thus things got to become a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working order in London we have now .
we have to ro@@ b the rest completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back out of the se@@ am area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the play from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the left flan@@ k over the left flan@@ k , and then moved the ball to the gate in order to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a course .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge on Saturday from the outcome of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the days of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inev@@ itable , a law@@ less wa@@ ist between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod that will protect from the bracel@@ ets to the gymn@@ ast of the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
don &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bors in the queu@@ e in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey is still available .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , could well have been sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertisement , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even f@@ encing .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights at the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade the sports that are not commonly accepted : air @-@ guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have a long rule .
but if I could make humble arguments to my particular favourite , then let me attention to the discre@@ tion charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jump has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so anno@@ ying that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent men to the competition , it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping and a athletes who have made it up to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline jumping has a certain surface char@@ me , partly because it sounds a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - the cart@@ oon@@ ist trem@@ bling of his never ending asc@@ ending - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ as@@ ion and do@@ cking , the two sports that are essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
jumping fighters jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic Museum for execution , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fellow athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ed in their quest to go to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the goal , sometimes go and back , up and down to the playground .
they do not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also in the television broadcast , another polite goal : the world or the Olympic champion .
the targeted quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up an audience to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel when looking at this games as a bit gu@@ ilt .
the trampoline provides a breathing snack with it .
the vector of the trampoline is up above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or she pr@@ un@@ es , seem@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then go back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the finish , no sl@@ umping in the distance , but dre@@ amy , elegant lift of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympics .
the qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming from 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the du@@ cks as part of a afternoon blo@@ c at both days starting from 14.00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ looked during general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ affen and the objective of male athletes - as it struck the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is waiting for its air ring , new fan base .
&quot; a Generation &quot; Protestant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , a ally of the US
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia , calls for violent resistance in the government .
witnesses say that the police were killed during clas@@ hes with police officers .
is Ethiopia right now ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and far more territ@@ ories .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med to roads and desired fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses identified that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security personnel hit young people with st@@ resses , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to summar@@ ize this country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services cooperate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , when at all , get so much Western help .
the Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a considerable speed .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ ler@@ ite in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the re@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , where dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively transferred to silence .
many were sent into exile , or sent into exile , or put into the deser@@ ters of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and those no other options have to protest out , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a professor in Central America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor space to lit@@ ig@@ ation with regard to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a widespread election last year , ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , tension grows along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this sh@@ ack@@ ing , controversial line called in June hundreds of life .
anal@@ ysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden were forced to force more or less in recent years , the turbul@@ ence could explo@@ it and be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years tend to explo@@ de from ink@@ ing@@ le under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and improved its Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what it is at regular intervals , especially in protests , so many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conc@@ eal where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ian gave them to be so in relation to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ as in Ethiopia .
Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural fo@@ es .
since the eth@@ n@@ ons we prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which are mainly coming from Christian countries , in politics and economics as they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos and live in low@@ land regions .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ public illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly pos@@ ing out to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special commission@@ er to process enemies and to make them bad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ on Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike the Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of the northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that he doesn &apos;t enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was an up@@ heav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing , according to the analysis of the government apparently sli@@ d and stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ ers , many Protest@@ ants were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest passed quickly .
development experts comm@@ ended Ethiop@@ ian leader for its visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ atory train , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty reduction .
obviously , this is not the intention of the internal dis@@ mis@@ sal of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hat@@ red over to the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are bringing its pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even when it was recently closed that they closed this base .
while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to break out his allies in an already vol@@ atile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin grat@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his claim to ISIS was &apos; Sar@@ cas@@ m &apos; .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday through his campaign that his repeatedly rec@@ claimed asser@@ tion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist state of Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication failed to communicate new questions about the Presi@@ dents of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Presi@@ dential Data &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he is able to communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his mates , who ende@@ av@@ ours to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection , to declare in the ex@@ propri@@ ation position , which he could not meant .
after he had made the thinking on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made a reference to the claim on Thursday and in@@ sist@@ ed in interviews that he really didn &apos;t int@@ end that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply brilliant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et was opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews he said it was completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ bin@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to we@@ aken the statement by repe@@ ating him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate had to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism from Mr. Tr@@ ump came down while he tried to focus on its campaign because of falling demand to economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es to economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this topic .
commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and found their word boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he appe@@ aled to himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to send Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he said later , Of course I said the sar@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then return to your needs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of its methods to test such as certain messages from his fans , as they arrive , and then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction is falling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who monitors both of the candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think too , it &apos;s clever enough to keep his say@@ ings v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even corrosive sound , because its fra@@ ctional values went further back .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a guided tour of big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head racing in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying not to exc@@ use himself for his prov@@ ok@@ ing statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his testimony or mis@@ use his humor .
but while he ampli@@ fies the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps dice his loyal inter@@ stre@@ ak into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ cession , there was much effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani talked about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s testimony was if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Obama had an almost unknown small organization before Obama . he called the rear @-@ heads , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most ma@@ inst@@ ream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government held under Obama in Mrs. Clinton as an external minister , ISIS allowed them to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media and gave them to ride on any of his words and to be bi@@ ased against him .
he de@@ fied the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats spell over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once more p@@ ushes the market from the market , Café is back in green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ atter@@ ned café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi , but it served for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie set up the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local indigenous people as last loss in a opposite city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead to the Chelsea Hotel and now is a soap shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when New York is change , it is also re@@ discovery .
a restored Ver@@ b cafe opened last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good , too .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time collabor@@ ator of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
verb uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ator bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches stand with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions .
it is natural white @-@ bowls .
the café is not served beer anymore , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ owed power of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also driven by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to green@@ point she would take the way .
having closed the verb , she gave a while to the coffee break , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture of the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they place this day instead of their usual iced coffee house a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and rendered imm@@ or@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch , and they prepare my spell @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal got still his usual order , but sometimes it changes his Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not make a waste that the soap shop has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to make a special soap for verb in the cold @-@ powered coffee of the caf@@ és as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will come to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the Café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he imag@@ ined her to see them soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
fill in the ch@@ ill coffee shop into bott@@ led coffee and sell it on a local juice .
there is a chance that the Café expands to a neighbor@@ ing building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ gre@@ ed and said he was destroyed in the ground when the Café was closed .
as the new cafe , Wh@@ itt told that the location of the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .

&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery hist@@ ori@@ ans .

they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the ice@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ itz@@ el I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .

as the repor@@ ter made hack@@ ed , this was appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stret@@ ches the ingredient .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ates for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were the Americans sent food during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country went to reverse is no longer expanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when the food was a central , felt topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bund@@ le co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Omar was a member of &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the newspaper Bild @-@ Zeitung , nearly 6@@ 0,000 people recovered their lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers contact their own life to move people out of bom@@ bed houses , and to afford first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil protecting who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Sy@@ rer to the shining symbol figure in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes has never seen himself , he said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks often come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna site .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic until today .
Greenland first got up with 150 years of young .
he is swi@@ m@@ ly floating along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour he reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it depends , the five metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this lifestyle shaped , however , seems to be an im@@ print concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report on &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein at the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the Evol@@ u@@ tionary schol@@ ar thought that Greenland &apos;s rock is rocky .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , last@@ ly , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer to use the water temperatures below the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland company .
your time @-@ sn@@ u@@ cle@@ o moder@@ ation works , when they equi@@ val@@ ed six animals with a radio station .
lo@@ ot these shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a animal species found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for cad@@ aver , which down from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest one @-@ inch size was measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the len@@ tic@@ kers of shar@@ ks .
this centre of eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks which the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in len@@ tic@@ kers .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the peak of 220 centi@@ meters length , the len@@ tic@@ kers included a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland we had regular Carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arise from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an old carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland , while the record @-@ shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are more than four metres , known .
now the researchers were able to assign an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters was probably determined at the threshold of sexually mature and his age at 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ehol@@ ding is apparent at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is likely to be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
no co@@ incidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live in icy waters is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , at the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught in front of Alaska .
the low temperatures often runs the organism of the animals living there .
so they mature later - and al@@ beit slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , animals are often particularly large .
the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal affects heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on concentr@@ ating as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ u@@ tionary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein as early as possible .
a very big animal should invest its resources more in a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has therefore the best chances to attract new jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner , head of the Compet@@ ence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain whether money stores may continue from London from financial transactions in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport .
they just use big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects to deal with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , has united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the biggest banks of the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emergency tank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg holds a large fund sector , but also tail@@ or as Dublin as a result of the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner .
in addition to the Seine , the rent for the first real estate business property by 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and fewer crime .
in a ranking of the business consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands at third place seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Paris to 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit .
consequently , the power of powers : in London , according to numbers of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal rights from the he@@ pat@@ itis C patent suit with Mer@@ ck
a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal expense , which are created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated of damages amounting to $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster cases S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an US judge ordered a pattern of mis@@ conduct , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ra@@ cial actions .
in survey on Thursday , US official judge at Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs that were created during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to lev@@ y Gilead to the market of a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck each other accused of def@@ endants and ownership of laboratory work carried away from which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r used to contribute to the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
by the US , troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal control
Hillary Clinton published their fiscal policy for 2015 on Friday , this revealed for the presidential election of demo@@ c@@ rats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton &apos;s former president Bill Clinton generated an in@@ comes of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax explic@@ ations of the past ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; clin@@ ched the fight against Jennifer Pal@@ mer@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax rul@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is usual for US presidential candidates to publish their tax explic@@ ations , although they are not obliged by the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax test for the tax authorities as a reason for its ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ ton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er said to CNN that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the controls are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already disc@@ arded that his ref@@ usal issues relating to wealth , his business groups and different other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the internet in the high @-@ ranking Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax returns .
on Thursday she spoke the subject of a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish its tax explic@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO has announced that Tr@@ ump did not pay for two years or only very little taxes , and an econom@@ ist of New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make persons the more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called on behalf of Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , whose Ber@@ kshire Hath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ e glomer@@ ate has its headquarters to exchange Tr@@ ump at a meeting in order to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he had just subjected to a tax test of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign published fiscal policy until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective pre @-@ tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 fiscal policy of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of their income was referred to as wages , unlike most of the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their primary investment fund was a low @-@ cost index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

natural protective in Tanzania uti@@ lize an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to stop eleph@@ ants from people who inhabited sett@@ lements - they throw con@@ doms which are filled with ch@@ ili powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea ahead of years ago , trained with the US natural protection , trained by volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , a non @-@ ste@@ pless four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing without harm animals .
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend itself .
Friday is World Annual Day , dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ...

the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and a horn in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he isn &apos;t slo@@ ped down , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ wol@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ce mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom spl@@ its with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed the fine dust of Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a hint quite normally already in order to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
one last option is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a golf course into the air and a loud , bright explosion causes .

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Not@@ ification - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ tied a media uprising , after he betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , there was no Israeli pre @-@ election as it had claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; wrote his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tested Israel to be found on the pre @-@ selection list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , eliminated that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him like Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it , behind , dissolved in the director , even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre @-@ selection is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worker was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this hotel chain has borne in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved quite big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some instru@@ cted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have happened to the alleged &quot; Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , where it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all the alle@@ g@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement to include Israel in the elec@@ toral list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police relies on Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo were gathered together with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for public image system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began to collect the students apart from police officers , which led the police to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be wag@@ ered to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the preliminary president Michel T@@ emer at walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran are suddenly rising to 71 % - RT business
according to the increase of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an at the annual comparison of 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly , divided by the Ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , the further trade of trading is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade event was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian foreign represent@@ ations about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel to travel , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist groups in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of old Persian civi@@ lization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bridge the period until the next romantic pilgrimage of all minist@@ rants in the next two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ration Round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several pilgrimage aims were tested and decided finally to see for the bishop of Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage was offered .
16 Min@@ is made of Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ Rooms made their way .
in the evening , priest served the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and distributed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster of Un@@ ser@@ er loved the wife , and so the pilgrimage was turned away from Münster .

S@@ cot Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
in the last evening , the Scottish team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 in the bicycle team of Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor of his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ade and made the legend hau@@ te when he stor@@ med his home to hit a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after performing in March at the train World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when Hin@@ ds appeared .
Ho@@ ys re@@ formed a gap that attemp@@ ted K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ t@@ winning - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic champion in the qualification round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the crew to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a major part of transformation , in order to slow down it in a higher gear to slow him and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert , and Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der fell to the podium than on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name .
we have placed an Olympic champion in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph over 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys &apos;s mark , there was no way that he dropped off to the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no verdict of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
for such a superior victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we came so badly with so many world titles so badly that it was incredible to win at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation bringing seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat the victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British Sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal .
the would come from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lon@@ ely , alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll are qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ mile race .
they finished in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won &apos;t win in London in 2012 , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .

after a truly extraordinary view of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drama in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , amid@@ st sex and mobil@@ ises , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton . &quot; &quot; &quot;

future of the Portland cr@@ ushing of Portland because of lifting the energy contract
the future of the aluminum sch@@ mel@@ ts of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are based on the game , as the plant operators are acqu@@ iring the energy supply contract and thereby under@@ went all delivery contracts , such as the supplier &apos;s energy company .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no other subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a payout for 20 years is exp@@ ires in November .
there are up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland stand in the game .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - may be at risk when closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , as the melting plant consum@@ es approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A joined the point of Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ o power station last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the current price of the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium melting plant with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina joint venture , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L goes from that the plant is still run in Portland , which means an additional physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L said that the contracts so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force since November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L goes from that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenue at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong appoint@@ ments for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared the value of the contracts in its annual decline in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book contracts negoti@@ ate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ ill ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the melt or ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company told that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year even if there is yet another explanation , why it came from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions in the sector before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
in regard to the analysis of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts of power .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
Kendall J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US V@@ ogue .
Bander@@ a , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me to the sight of this cover to crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revel@@ ations of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans family ) , which ends the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends with a classic twist : they have planned all a surprise @-@ party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é hi@@ jack@@ ed action of almost every birthday release of a children &apos;s post@@ age ( Se@@ ac@@ rest assured the phr@@ ase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a sign on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kris had to participate somehow in this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the M@@ ogue September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ ra great sister Kim likes it , what the V@@ ogue Cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league .
the issue is the most sold issue of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference that re@@ sembles a picture book as a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of advertising respon@@ ds ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the disclos@@ ure of his code stars is awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine se@@ ep still before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ itor and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence has been on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - in the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people or for reality stars or young people of today , who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( although it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
obviously , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success every day .
with their reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers has always been curious in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d asked her and called them &quot; The Mist@@ er of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings are again high when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the point of use , things seem to be passing by .
Kendall J@@ enner is on the cover of the sept@@ em@@ issue of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your under@@ coat of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all her sisters are selling images on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
they are sold by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the German magazine .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
annual centers include 16@@ 0.000 people each year .
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s budget needs will be rejected by the municipal centres annually , while the industry accounts for the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants and needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and others - they are looking for free legal advice and legal rights .
legal services of the community , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely trained , are ready for further reductions .
as of June next year , the legal centers are to be reduced to another 30 percent of its federal states .
the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Federation of Municipal Coun@@ ts revealed that thousands of people had been rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land municipal centres are under@@ financed chron@@ ically , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need is rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressed debts , families who have been dismissed through divi@@ den@@ cies - all these people have problems , and this survey shows that they can not receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of high @-@ needy people from Queens@@ land will be forced to help with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Gener@@ ational Justice and Federal Minister of Economy and the sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to withdraw this middle short@@ cuts so that people need help you get in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its promise to take funds for direc@@ ting on the national average .
it is now at the time to examine the needs of the municipal centres and customer community , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of countries @-@ elections : SPD and CDU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are considerable losses for government parties of the SPD and the CDU .
this was a representative pol@@ ls of the Federal Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely reign in the north , this is not possible after the question@@ ing in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD headed for 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent of five years ago to 24 percent .
according to pol@@ l , the Party pol@@ led only just ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the AF@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens are gradually increasing by 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the Schwerin country day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent each day .
at the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD Congress held only 23 percent ( 2011 of 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU still reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they were still anno@@ ying by the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would like to miss the default in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the followers now domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , so it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ abytes , which should now range for about two sel@@ fs with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ ,000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the early internet era of the internet era .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a couple of months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in West@@ h@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to that time a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , although qu@@ eting slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone family experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft .
today , the market dom@@ inion today , which all came much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , this is today for a very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , alone , 5@@ 55 million pieces were sold .
the global turnover of the equipment is around € 400 billion .
these are the well @-@ running business of the countless app vend@@ ors and the t@@ elecommunic@@ ations network .
around the Smartphone an entire industry is produced .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came first in 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communications ator to easily operate everything via touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , today , the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market , had the desc@@ endant .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen is now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a 20 years after its invention a self @-@ understanding .
on average , every German site now looks around 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in charge of the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessi@@ bility is also valid as a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and to expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but in all country renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the largest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we run a big effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local people and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already planning to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as it was ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such thinking that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I told that England will never be ready for the games and let &apos;s become bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .
the dou@@ bts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles for over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
extension is possible to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ching growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 bn of expensive infrastructure investments in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in suc@@ cession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two busy hi@@ kes of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and to expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to ensure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising trials , ad block@@ age , with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced it would block ad block@@ ings on his desktop page , in which users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook distributed that his desktop side would change the coding in terms of terms of advertising , which is part of the site advertising is to make difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o @-@ struggle between the inter@@ lock@@ ers open source community and the re@@ h@@ ers are already underway since the invention of display block@@ ers is underway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has launched in the fight , is a powerful indication for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using display block@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users with active users , which access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ve accounts for 84 per cent of the world &apos;s accounts .
the company does not apply to ad block@@ ages on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers don &apos;t have any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram , distributed a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , giving Facebook the investment of such stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control of people over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control in the hands of the people .
woman believes suicide on Swiss motorway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls for witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday had driven suicide by several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident happened at the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss @-@ born at the age of 49 aged several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , was to kill themselves .
she died still on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police , those , as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; log@@ ically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter was shared by the Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; he said .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the driver will not be held responsible for responsibility .
in each of the two cases - if one person ran in the dark on the free@@ way - has been decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that pede@@ stri@@ ans are in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ y@@ woman was acquitted of the neg@@ ligence after having over@@ drive a man and had killed one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious of the street un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report with the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Pro@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was once again hab@@ itable for the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms , which re@@ semble climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have res@@ umed similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow shift of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still turned into slowly .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to lodge life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of the Venus run their daily page of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that works like an umbrella in order to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average @-@ temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today .
the model created a history of Venus that re@@ sem@@ bled evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably hab@@ itable once it was the Venus -- in the course of several billion years , --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
your oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when your hydro@@ gen dropped it , only a thick atmosphere back to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know them today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and re@@ marked that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been in the course of the summer long and have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs it and it &apos;s a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a certain number of decisions regarding decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Z@@ acc@@ ic , who had been hired on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , the winner of the Jack Adams Award winner was the best coach of the League .
he led the Club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches drawn in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers take up talks again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for Northern oil workers shall be exposed , while all the parties for a new talk of talks are put on the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can affir@@ m that we have agreed with the decre@@ ment process of the current Stre@@ ites , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions at the coming weeks , the beginning of next year will begin to rest@@ art the problems .
the unions told that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage short@@ cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore @-@ contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company takes the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed and plans for thousands of people and plans to impos@@ e its oil and gas trade activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its operating activities using the UK energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are located , due to the lower cru@@ de prices under pressure , an economic situation , which was for@@ tified by the British ruling in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in early this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes ar@@ ising from a generation in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and in the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotary rate of stars at the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ ch teles@@ cope also helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ations under the star@@ es of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why are stars in star@@ ry at different rates , as well as in the context of the rotation periods with the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from Earth .
many stars in this star@@ ry which originated approximately 125 million years ago will now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now fastest .
leading up to top rot@@ ations , these mature stars require large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds are traveling through the magnetic fields of stars they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ tert , his rotation speed begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by loc@@ ating the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- such as sun @-@ stain@@ s -- .
the latest catalogue of rotary rates indicates that more intense stars slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ ing the stars with dancers , taking larger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare display qualities such as rotary rates .
&quot; the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of rotation rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us , how we would like to learn more about how the spell and why stars down their rotary rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return disclos@@ ure , the 41 year @-@ old professional to the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays became one last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under one ten years agreement , granted him a year 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 he will be as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player he paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays point out only two additional bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not yet to be accepted in the Hall of Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his occurr@@ ence out of space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was assigned to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; which had forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 , he was blocked for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ icious , for years on an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounter@@ s yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League might have done for the year 2014 even a favour , because I played a break for 20 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez happ@@ en@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his deportation days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds in their last games will get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a shooting tour . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first doping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get caught : because of a positive doping work , Wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ber Adrian Target &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot start from Poland in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will over@@ shadows over the first official d@@ op@@ es of the 2016 Olympics .
an athl@@ ete has won nearly one medal .
the first official d@@ op@@ es of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have become known before the seventh competition day before the seventh competition .
the Chinese swi@@ m@@ suit Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athlet@@ ics competition .
in Chen last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de been demonstrated , that is used as a massive remedy for doping substances .
the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon and their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed them the bronze medal .
on Friday Chen would have to take part of the incident over 50 m of free .
Chen has requested the opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demanded from Chen &apos;s full @-@ term cooperation with the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are honoured with the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news se@@ ep@@ ed over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is innocent , &quot; The only declaration could be supplements , &quot; said the athlet@@ ics crisis .
according to the report it is said to act on the forbidden agent of blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ resources EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended pre@@ face , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly informed criticism of the Athlet@@ ic Athlet@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t pull the right loops , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians have been excluded , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Target &quot; became known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days prior to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deny the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa , a further heavy blow for the Rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the complete Russian crew to an exception due to systematic d@@ op@@ ings , but also in Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport the earlier distribut@@ ors in China had also cat@@ ered for heavy disputes between the athletes .
thus , Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang har@@ sh@@ on .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the centre of a meditation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this .
sun was tested in 2014 on the Chinese championships positively on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ im@@ re lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ aser hack@@ ers her ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers of war@@ ungs @-@ malware engage a targeted company to start @-@ up and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware company Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies have at least once in the past twelve months at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were once again target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were willing will@@ ingly charged the sol@@ dering of the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially dis@@ pres@@ sive ran@@ s@@ om is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary @-@ fast evolution of the malware software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ Cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the press@@ way software for itself .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates in a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , they will search for long @-@ long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files , as well as archives files and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ jack .
in order to get the code @-@ key code , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ mal@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin - above .
but where in private users the personal photo database is on the game , there are companies for sen@@ sible customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
consequently , the damage falls from if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of Germany &apos;s affected companies reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to fall completely under@@ cut the business , in case of a case people were mort@@ al .
in Germany , several hospitals victims were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure &apos;s safety researchers investigated the exploitation of commercial areas and contact with the results : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to make a kind of customer service to take more money .
you will declare their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or dec@@ ryp@@ t free example files .
and you will rede@@ em private people after payments of a few hundred Euro , companies have to negoti@@ ate a hard and five @-@ digit total amount , to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potential and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the hack@@ ers are becoming professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware for approximately within a week . &quot;
more likely , it is that it is three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ jack .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself , consulting and additional tools bought for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ t@@ tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then search for more hack@@ ers , to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log into one of the forums on the ground , buying the set of a crimin@@ als and instru@@ cts the software to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected host .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is well known for many companies to secure their data better .
over 50 percent of firms @-@ IT @-@ responsible for the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes database trust , Ran@@ som@@ ware can rely on @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful surveys , the perpet@@ rators instead of the release of sensitive data like about customer lists or pricing calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ Cy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential of damage according to type of data still a multiple higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators also may take some new destinations in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demon@@ ated safety researchers as they were able to get thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a block blocked , the heating so many victims may well be a ran@@ s@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of the heater to block an entire production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the little HR @-@ V Honda would pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be really flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is rather small , although only 1.@@ 60 m high , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear of space .
the materials of the inside are well processed and work comfortably , just the cockpit @-@ top is falling somewhat .
versatile than comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a boot from 453 l at high @-@ operated and 10@@ 26 l back @-@ locked back lean back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear side can be folded like chin @-@ up and thus offer box storage that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor .
the rear cavity is well loaded , but the load @-@ pitch with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should set up his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is equipped : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the handling behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be more direct .
the equipment can be explained in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
the City @-@ emergency braking system is one of the safety systems ( co@@ operates at the pace 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and trace systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision avo@@ ids sometimes because he &apos;s rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ ru@@ ding objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable the bin@@ ocular wiz@@ ard works very reliably .
and the intelligent Tem@@ p re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ les the speed .
the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are OK .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel from € 23@@ 000 .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday suitable car .
Airline is not liable : overthrow in passenger
a airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger .
because liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap when the fall .
however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it trade itself about a common risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay the man compensation .
disease : when the organiz@@ ers paid
after their journey , vac@@ ation@@ ers get money back , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten per cent of guests were reported to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the negoti@@ ated case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ ur@@ l@@ b was severely affected by diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faulty cla@@ iming , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey was a lack - and accused of the organis@@ er .
the cl@@ utter had no success in court .
although the se@@ wage plant was defective .
but the organis@@ er stopped only shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea water was fine .
he did not hurt his information flows so the judgment .
no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection each other - belonged to the general risk of life .
only 38 of 6@@ 91 guests were only ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state had n@@ ailed and decided to react to terrorist attacks at the same time .
surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
we will not allow terror@@ ists this triumph .
if perpet@@ rators need to leave the country , but increase security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement a implementation of proposals by the German election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit order for more than several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies to terrorism stand under punishment again .
video surveillance should be improved that ceas@@ e@@ fire should be amended , especially when purchasing weapons in the Internet .
the last much discussed per@@ spiration for doctors should remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions with the trouble of trouble , as the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be decre@@ asing , he said with a view on psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to oppos@@ e a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister holds better social care .
teachers should be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mat@@ ised humans .
in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special fields of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of criminal investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to the security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister clearly spoke against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an office for the hin@@ ge @-@ makers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was rejected by the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship .
a general ban of full di@@ ligence er is problem@@ atic for constitutional problems .
you can &apos;t realize everything you reject , and I reject the carrying of the Bur@@ ka .
these rules could be spoken about rules on road traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister before , he wanted to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror @-@ packages and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party congress Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ ver@@ bs and a fusion of the common right bring people no more security in this land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way br@@ inger
it regularly sticks on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal split shall be extended .
this is good news for all cars of the car that are in traffic on the ambient road every night in the st@@ au , when they drive through the motorway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road of road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler street sign the right track for 700 meters .
drivers can then roll directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
the big advantage : traffic will arrive early , whereby the total amount is improved on the multiple section of the state road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger anno@@ ys the drivers especially between 17 o &apos;clock and 7 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back@@ log goes through to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also .
reason is the needle eye on B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler lane exit .
from here the traffic is only dri@@ fts on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back to a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to record the heavy @-@ duty fuel consumption above all .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated push perform@@ ers will continue , the company cannot say .
however , it &apos;s to be counted with years : for the bridge has an official rem@@ n@@ itude of time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the provincial firm has been deliber@@ ately chosen for the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural Activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The invisible building . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s enables teen@@ agers with immig@@ ration and refugee camp , to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an introduction of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy &apos;s Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was attended by 19 students between eleven and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interests , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the students from the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ography , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible to follow the action performance nevertheless , so the press release of the boy &apos;s Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. t@@ ann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Voice , and the Young Theater will cooperate in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from October to December , you@@ ths with and without escape and migrant background between 14 and 20 years are supposed to be given professional courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
given the increased refugee tax the association expects to take part in a lot of classes that want to take part .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope for lack of weather
the weather had the star @-@ pi@@ pers in southwest Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night has been badly suitable for clouds and rain , the leader of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope lies on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars in the sky .
with the star@@ shed it is Persian , which with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour is one of the fastest star@@ ters .
they have their names , because they apparently come out of the Per@@ se@@ us constellation lying in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against in@@ som@@ nia
in the evenings , one day@@ ens etern@@ ally around , at night , one is stun@@ ned , in the morning the so@@ ap@@ ing so@@ unding isn &apos;t thinking about sleep anymore .
this is anything but rest@@ ful .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders , and more than ten per cent , do their sleep frequently or permanently rest@@ less than rest@@ ful .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many reasons underlying it , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , the Executive Board of the German Society for She@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one under@@ stands under@@ stands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an entry and sleep disorder .
just that sleep , many people feel as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German House of Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or poll@@ uted factors can also be used .
not rare is the sexual disorder expression of a different disorder .
&quot; very early wake up is particularly frequent with depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors are different .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and may cause wom@@ ens to face everyday problems and care , gives you an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should we sleep with sleep disorders ?
who should not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week , and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , obli@@ que We@@ e@@ ß .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can be very different : one is shut down , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulty with attention and concentration , has irrit@@ ability or physical pain such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease your sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
when treatment options occur among other things of conduct , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany there are hardly any Sle@@ ep Sle@@ epers in Germany emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ eping Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems you should turn into the doctor , obli@@ que We@@ e@@ ß .
this can clari@@ fy with exam@@ inations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in the sleep laboratory , medical advice , for example , when snor@@ ing with breath@@ s , in case of illness or if you find the cause of a sleep disorder , says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the inquiry .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make no sleep hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after the short@@ cut one goes into bed at its normal time .
beside the electro@@ des at the body , one we@@ ars a nose , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
it also records a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can I get problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of positions on which you can attach for better sleep .
wo@@ e count on : regular sleeping and elev@@ ation times are not too long in bed , not to sleep long in bed , not watch television for sleeping , alcohol to avoid and at night not at the clock - then you start to get rid of immediately , and that is quite un@@ favorable .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ alli@@ sts in swimming
by Facebook , the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler said goodbye to the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
he brought gold for the first time in December 2014 with the short World Championships in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler now protected his ex @-@ team mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € prize money and a jungle of 15@@ 0,000 € shouldn &apos;t be wonder@@ ing about missing med@@ alli@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 year old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the swimming pool in the swimming sport is bad , the doping control however is very good .
with this we can not compete with countries that do not promote much and maintain the topic D@@ oping not so precisely or even run it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before starting to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not control a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent Control@@ lers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A cannot take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hamburg election , who has meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : B@@ ott@@ age of Bag@@ gage :
professional Die@@ be at Düsseldorf Airport
civil f@@ ahn@@ ders of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police recorded the capture of two women and two men aged from 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had conducted several bags of bags and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil servants recognized in the area of the Dus@@ seldorf area , a gang that was known for the police officers from former theft .
the two women and two men had carried out several delic@@ ac@@ ies since mid @-@ July , they were most common , working and worked very profession@@ ally .
the Speci@@ alists of the Krimin@@ al@@ Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 may prove the th@@ ie@@ ves that went specially for off@@ ending criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
in doing so , they carried more about 15.000 Euro .
built for old buildings , some Lind@@ en@@ um@@ ps , in between , a remainder of the header : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain did not affect the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; in town .
if you walk along the east to the west you arrive at playing places , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone called &quot; ugly ! &quot; on the façade of a grey house .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dismant@@ led , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called , however , in recent weeks , they are ob@@ sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ized with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house is owned by number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents rent lease , ground floor , are still spaces and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator handle repeatedly for a hard procedure of police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after on 22 June the rooms were evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to the police , according to 30 @-@ 40 officials and three team cars from the spot , locked parts of the street , locked up visits to the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers signed the rooms on behalf of unknown owner owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and building workers went under the le@@ ver of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for walking with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the homes in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and nur@@ ser@@ y are located .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who raised three children , mainly from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the care before increasing agents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wish to sail mostly police protection against v@@ and@@ al@@ ers .
the dit@@ ch , who inside the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police do not exist between house @-@ occupied and their neighbours .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers area , which also today compared with the rest of the city a lower average income and high ar@@ du@@ ous risk .
the houses and native projects include a long time for the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including nearly all the entire ma@@ inst@@ er road near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under great police power in a down@@ right road power , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and still occupied by people today , who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood in recent years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and pol@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them now residents of GDR @-@ times and former house @-@ occupied their Kie@@ z .
this has also been noticeable for rentals , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked by symbols for this development : they recognize it in ins@@ ulted windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades which were disc@@ arded with pockets .
no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbours that are as a problem could be , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : off@@ ences such as body injury , according to polic@@ emen are almost exclusively opposed to polic@@ emen .
the most significant part of the off@@ ences do non @-@ damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to controversial 94 , cannot be a speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what violence committed , it is important : the people in 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the famous burning cars make it no longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for studying archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er road - and stayed .
that is why it was so important that the local residents got their road : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly exposed the interpretation of the inter@@ pret@@ ations of the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to move away : character@@ less new buildings in former building g@@ aps that displ@@ ace old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the most important con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well cont@@ am@@ inated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot;
but what should one do when a man list@@ ens to it ?
on all sides of fru@@ str@@ ation , the police and the inhabitants st@@ alls on all sides .
for zo@@ oming looking over colour bom@@ bers , K@@ erst@@ in has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who is going on , it should be aware of that - just like anyone who moves into a pub area , can compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons presented only with pre @-@ names are requested to be called by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee camp
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
she also is a social worker on site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
you can see yourself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that your volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sh@@ ale is now , the ei@@ fer@@ ous wool mel@@ ee , which primarily has a problem .
for example , some - less dar@@ ling than on the multitude of ke@@ yp@@ assing tasks - meant - as the administration wanted to write the place .
he was searched for a talent with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ ving wool mel@@ ee .
but administration work is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka says D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it goes around organization , work with the people locally , and behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer said that An@@ ni@@ ka is supporting D@@ eu@@ sh@@ le honest and full @-@ official players .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the sink road
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized .
in connection to the connection , the municip@@ alities are responsible .
they have to teach refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ a and the Government and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner will offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to , administration doesn &apos;t find private apartments .
so far , it has not been used to rely on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes have to be found as it says so beautiful .
so , soon new containers will be installed in the Water@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
this is the point of view , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are inter@@ ns , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine client reports .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motivation and very tidy , such as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but this does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a breeding feeling .
so it offers quot@@ as such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you also jump to administration and volunteer .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to declare the refugees , that it takes you , and you can make sense to time , for example with language courses .
those who feel at some point , he can &apos;t help Ur@@ bach , would not work and be un@@ profitable , I will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases , however , is said to be honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , where there is nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two come fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve could call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a remaining risk could be and will not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also the subject of refugees .
they should have fear that the assass@@ ination attempt to make it completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , capit@@ als must be held on site and in the region to create activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always have in the background that soon a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer , shy away .
actually , it is not fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes a clear fact that Ur@@ bacher are already utiliz@@ ed to integrate the hi@@ ther@@ to existing people .
these are about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in trouble , one can help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
