<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are in their tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small, and warns about how the state of economy cannot harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, it would be different, claimed to be Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will frightened controls, and he is strong for far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, against it, says: the State has certain tasks to open, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes were increased to the rich, says they.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the muts, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical tea party of the Republican stripe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, a partial internal discussions could be delivered on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and to drive coal in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in contrast, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme and demands:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposition of trade agreements, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both, however, both the USA will not isolate from international trade but just American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise him up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what Trump wants to do this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rinsed, then he says he must not be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">One side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are holding him before, so the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least the rich the rich they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Outside"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and an official end of the eight months long lasting warfare of words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives its Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's palace in reception, I cannot deny that Ankara denied this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a stop, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting smiles had an allied and radiant heat, even for its restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan immediately spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis but even further improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had so much worse than would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Me, his enthusiasm, seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduction: the shot of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutured.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The walk was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroi will be rebuild again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the period, the government controlled media led a violent, non-restricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as the Turks would bear it for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of senior civil servants, that peanogans have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria in Syria, to be controlled by the so-called Islamist state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message said that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin got the apology of President that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends that he can get after he was beheaded by a failed coup d "état in almost his last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecasted public transportation, vegetables and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" "" "tourists where long, tomatoes are long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West because its response to the attempted power supply was regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this goes to the persisting Groll on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the gout on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of state won a bonus in Ankara following the attempted coup d "état for the elected coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-noticed for Moscow, a self-understanding that has self-sighted fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glittering palace built by Russia and Turkey, as it declared to me an analyst once," "" "Alliance of Foreign" "" ": two countries that encounter the west and being badly handled and ignited." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but in Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "it could be significant that after almost three hours of first call, both presidents say on the press conference that they wouldn't even have accepted the subject." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey has deliberately promised to answer a question about their differences, whereas Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, NATO member Turkey has shot the Russian battle jet, it certainly is better to talk to each other at least.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as special officer for environmental and transport agents.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin it reads that Putin ordered the missal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential department. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Vice-President since 2012, was named to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, Germany, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo message.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later Chief of the Chief of Staff and Chief of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin," "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the most important task of government to support your activity as head of government regarding bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and put Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage has made Moscow mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time in Vladimir Putin's strict confidentiality and works as he was for the Soviet secret service to the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reaffirmed his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows this.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once quoted as potential president, would like to run into Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the Kremlin site, Ivanov said," "" "It is true that I have asked you to put this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - one could almost say - complainable post for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as the former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Employment Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin had come to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could become president's second term president of Russia, since a third term of mandate expired against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putting, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about bringing people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially set to the TV, then to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>

<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagined among the women's Olympics in Turnen, and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turkeys, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspire many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewist and Madison Kocian who is Cathkin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has fixed the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, number one has been one of the female gymnastings an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This indicates strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas welcomed a surprising Olympic team and cheering.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to be witnessed incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but you do not see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympics will only have four turkeys in the team. besides, that is the last year Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality shows that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner first place in private gymnasium that will maintain by parents, who will come up by parents for training, setup, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner, and family).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasters lie in wealthy suburbs, who can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner receive its total training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained her athletes since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the congregations of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, provide a free and easily accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasement of 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer to the youth of high quality exercises that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides lifetime benefits to health and schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it is the inspiration for this team, which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the practice and that is great." ""</seg>

<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team champion and thank you, hatred her so many young girls with different background to start healthful, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by gathering fatty acids in the arterial fires, forming the pads.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worreflex a serious test - giving some of the most dirty and most ekest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk pushed his train to a euro area, a yellow-ring binder and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before emptied every object, it used an Luminometer to show oneself and to show us what he is introduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, pull the flush with a pull-pull, which was already used by thousands of others, may be totally revolting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a mixer.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals on promoting intestinal bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thankfully, nothing left what he emptied, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intestine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations up to flush buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "he said in the film:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just perfect for his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing He refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometrics will be fresh washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop after their Luminometres was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valid produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial capacity at different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes the worst thing I spoke in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not stop here, because it is awkingly listed here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company receives Mr Wright with valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that fascinating to look at and at the same time declares the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we led mad Brainstormings through which we ended, that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in healthy health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide more information about an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directing the film, added: "let me say," I should have lost my respect for Ian, when he showed some of the things that I have referred to, such as the ecelly Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to put them, and others in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by the year 2015, 84 percent of all questioned lactic acid bacteria present in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestinal and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products that contained lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">Having been removed from their property, shocked employees found their property in a irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls instructed crackles holes, wood panels were sliced, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated at the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears not to repair the apartment anymore.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I am the view that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider because this property is probably not considered as a beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who were now living in the apartment, and the police said that the terror which the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, drug abuse, drug trafficking, drugs and excessive screams, streches and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for antisocious behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delined her and her partner these week violently from the property, after they gave them a extended period of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deletion were cheered by lightened neighbours that told her life to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One told me, "They shook no one."</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it was a family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was summoned at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church, trash and old toys were thrown down.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that it abhors the tenant to adopt any responsibility for their behavior and to their family as a delay is always the last step that is taking Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">It was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extremely difficult to look awful for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community, which are brave to us and have provided us the information we have done." ""</seg>

<seg id="32">A dirty mattress lined in one of the bedrooms of the house after delaying on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the in-house administration are now disposed of rubbergs, which surround the house</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year, the Salzburg Festival highlights the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelal Dirigente Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm."</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays a bit older than Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers wormwood with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because they are musically outstanding!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel Pretty, oh so Pretty, I feel Pretty and humty and Bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it's clever, of course naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"she resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as Römerin," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is a wonderful artist full of praise for operability: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vacationships from North Rhine-Westphalia to not choose the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as so far, it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and farm combat - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election campaign, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists that are on the land, Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers are helper, inflating posters, distribute flyer, spread flyers and end up with the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's vote in the election and last festival day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern needs to be over for the people over the past.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, lies in the polls only behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting, how strongly Neuling AFD cuts and what remains at the end of coalition factorments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicious election campaign, one sees his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spread roses and chat with people, as it did already its legendary word-karer predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors get cold feet and pulchancellor Angela Merkel at AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We create" "" "have accelerated the rise of the credits, which is likely to cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with their nickname, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong time at the right place election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited to Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel is a parliamentary circle in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Coke, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too bad anyone else from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU decreased largely to the common constituency and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means coking, plays only a "understandal role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that it was obsolete on the country, that it must be very strict to find a wire back to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens, barely there in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU campaign Kokert on his fellow contestants, however, is also self-derived:" "" "they need to go there where human beings are: Dormeste, Golden Weddings, each birthday party must be used" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats were last only 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had still won with 35,6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Kleinparty, with seven percent in the polls, should make the jump in the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue in the holidays of emergency and dispose of its constituencies in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" calls it the president Claudia Müller.</seg>

<seg id="2">At speed, with which the B 27 is gentle, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsibilities of the construction, at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and only at 20 o'clock, there are all praise to be praised.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty tough," Elvira Tetzlaff tells about the jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south end of the weekend until the end of October should be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we will also commend the opposite to the construction work, for example when it comes to set up Behind passes." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was wandered on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen was lifted, and again the connection to Rottenburg has once again been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofandingen to the B 27 again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasion through the place seems to be returned.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable complaints," "" "says the Deputy Director of the Management Board responsible for Florian King." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachacstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichwege were searching and rather familiar with their Navi as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, what led to some people to spend some truck in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the Speed limit has not been kept, the community called for the measuring vehicle from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable abuses," says King that made herself any location above the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute has been littered.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was at 77 kilometres per hour in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has passed on, it was never quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at B 27 there is only a little consolation that for customers of Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-restoration has led to revenue in them with sales, everybody who asks you will look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have "less to do with the" end customer, "for other companies, has hardly any consequences for this.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz talks about a" "" "maximum slight decrease" "", "but also grants that of course" "" "the mileage is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the local restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all of them have met it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">They were missing the clients of Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sales revenue represents "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road marking took his operation" "" "turned back two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by Göhner, whether it could be a financial compensation, otherwise indicated by the benefits of the location on the B. now she also benefited the disadvantages to carry out through the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">For other regular traffic control, other regular traffic management is less frequently recalled, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his pedigree returns to the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and birds, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers "biggest crisis that has experienced its place in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he still upheld this for sensible and demands nothing, which at Koalitian doesn't have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some new ideas presented by Maizière too.</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legally holy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even seem unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - with impatient treatment of patience for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said to say that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people are worried about safety in view of the high number of refugees.</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The hedging is large.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election fights.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly focusing on inner safety.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, there was high between both parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrisky strife about the equipment of the Federal Police, then via a safety state Minister of Interior Minister, in which the Ressortchefs also call for a Burka-prohibition and a reversal of double citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="18">Volkswagen produces 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time, worldwide 5,904 million.</seg>

<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen provides the opportunity for example a half year after upgrading, for example, to carry with a motor damage in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage caused nothing to do with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys silverplates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely males mid-age love sheets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you see the comment, in order to oversee him under the pseudonym non-avenue of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the so-called reformation of vinyl records not to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the news from physical objects, but is attributable to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all likelihood according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes of hobbies - it has an emotional importance: older platformer donors keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog has been a news report on TV, I would follow my camera, while I remain in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild, before I stick to keep my hands and keep a little effort like: "so, let's take a close look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were based, there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to place the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow by Sister Ray (number of people: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (number of people, a woman, probably around the 20) is one day because of the meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess so," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound panels, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates which he could not afford to buy, when he sold, when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was too young to buy them" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees to those who buy plates, rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets to apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the medias, people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted to purchase their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks that I managed, people usually have defended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica in order to recognize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers joined the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar silencer, from objects, the happy jugenderations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be filling a void, or the property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," WEZ said.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ intellectually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social worker!" "" "a staff of a band stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of news, I would probably look very worried, while I leafed through a stacks to Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (SNB data: three men mean age) has been working, has noticed a "trophy aspect."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said," I own no record player but I would like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them to the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are getting slow.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted a whole floor to the record, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, the photos make, teenagers and women medium age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizers and sextet Pop instead of speakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychological traumata are difficult to determine when you stand for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather gives a showdown as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve a lot, so the collecting of records is no real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of platters is... it drives up with a lovely sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired: urban outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I confess the jeans hotspot, I watch a group of young teen gems that join for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some as far as it is impossible to address them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry, and some customers can send to the depths of Soho, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money, is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they are at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and Onlinejoin forces.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday tomorrow with security not with the stroll through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while it withstands the gaze of an inconceerie, 30-year-old false moderator, who eats over the shoulders nothing of an intermediate age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day Rugby came in final on Thursday evening at a abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when she was beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a masterclass in handling, side-stping, descend, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiacaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was scorned by the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day might fall back to the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But if this form, Fiji could have put a 15-man team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a solace for UK - but it will probably not be that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chef Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost under Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This folder will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and made the attacks spring off having fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in Co. when you run in travelling buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With more than four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added a further attack on the right corner of which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A violent tickle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua saw a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the resurgence and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preceded by further weak tighlings of the UK Team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji had been born to play 7, while the GB is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out basic changes to half-time by and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua ran after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the southern slanders, whose fans floats, flags, and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It wasn't difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i bag dot with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle pointed, the Fijis hugged and the GB knocked down beaten decisively in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 conquered and Britain pushed South Africa into a half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's conversion to the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive leg work and scored a goal under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late tearling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-ASIDE team, secured the win - and the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no engines of engine than those games, and that wants to be.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing machine to the last, 220 hard shieve, which go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although it were only those who were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams was all present as she named for the second Olympics in succession, the first women in the history of British Sports, who used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her domination was absolute, after all her 39.ter is an unstruggling deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athons that reflect on the surface of the elegance of swarf, which is not reflected in the nature of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing, there's a battalion on content to make the difference and it was no one-conscious than the trainer, who would not survive this day before it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable, and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky enough to be at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, out of the season, in case that the break was at least the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even larger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediation of victory her first thought went to Williams, who spent a annoying morning so doing something more than usual, trying to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was as centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in an action in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much as I mean, how much I and Helen and also worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person to coaching or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no races during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the past 500 meters, when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were trapped very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, just stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race as we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take out for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover needs to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backport.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match against India that the Americans have won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who kept their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">She knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equisable in their group with the Britons on the first place that remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will match the first round on Saturday in the final match.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two teams in their group will win the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little bit longer out of the way that leads the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game likes to go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising thing by their success story, four years after she landed with the last London Games on the last 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey girl in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years ago she became a national player in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, since she was not able to qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham was an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, and thus things got to become a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change and a physical change" said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working order in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to rob the rest completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback out of the seam area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the play from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the left flank over the left flank, and then moved the ball to the gate in order to get a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the days of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inevitable, a lawless waist between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that will protect from the bracelets to the gymnast of the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Don't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then Logan Dooley is still available.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples, could well have been sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertisement, if he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even fencing.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights at the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade the sports that are not commonly accepted: air-guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have a long rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make humble arguments to my particular favourite, then let me attention to the discretion charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jump has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so annoying that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent men to the competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping and a athletes who have made it up to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline jumping has a certain surface charme, partly because it sounds a clownsschool for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - the cartoonist trembling of his never ending ascending - but also the Grazie of the gymnasion and docking, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Jumping fighters jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling motions (turning, Hreal and Saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to the official Olympic Museum for execution, difficulty level and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Fellow athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallied in their quest to go to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes go and back, up and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only chase the finish line or the baseline, but also in the television broadcast, another polite goal: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel when looking at this games as a bit guilt.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline provides a breathing snack with it.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunes, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then go back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the finish, no slumping in the distance, but dreamy, elegant lift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming from 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ducks as part of a afternoon bloc at both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked during general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angaffen and the objective of male athletes - as it struck the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley is waiting for its air ring, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia, calls for violent resistance in the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police were killed during clashes with police officers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right now?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and far more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed to roads and desired fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses identified that policemen were shot and killed on unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security personnel hit young people with stresses, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to summarize this country and in future it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, when at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendullerite in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents were effectively transferred to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or sent into exile, or put into the deserters of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and those no other options have to protest out, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a professor in Central America." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor space to litigation with regard to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "after a widespread election last year, ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tension grows along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this shacking, controversial line called in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden were forced to force more or less in recent years, the turbulence could exploit and be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years tend to explode from inkingle under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian were able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and improved its Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what it is at regular intervals, especially in protests, so many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that conceal where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian gave them to be so in relation to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicas in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not a natural foes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the ethnons we prospered the Amharas, which are mainly coming from Christian countries, in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos and live in lowland regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-public illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly posing out to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special commissioner to process enemies and to make them bad.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">The Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemarion Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike the Meles, who came from the Tigray region of the northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, according to the analysis of the government apparently slid and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razers, many Protestants were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that time of unrest passed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts commended Ethiopian leader for its visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulatory train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">Obviously, this is not the intention of the internal dismissal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, run by Tigray and the hatred over to the Tigray will always be more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are bringing its peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even when it was recently closed that they closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West definitely wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to break out his allies in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks often come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the Sanna site.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland first got up with 150 years of young.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is swimly floating along the North Atlantic coast, in an hour he reaches an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends, the five metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped, however, seems to be an imprint concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report on "Science" in any case from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein" "" "commented Alexander Scheuerlein at the Max Planck Institute for Demgraphic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the Evolutionary scholar thought that Greenland's rock is rocky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, lastly, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coastal areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer to use the water temperatures below the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland company.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-snucleo moderation works, when they equivaled six animals with a radio station.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot these sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a animal species found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for cadaver, which down from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest one-inch size was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lentickers of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks which the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high carbon-14 in lentickers.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the peak of 220 centimeters length, the lentickers included a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland we had regular Carbon-14 quantities that arise from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an old carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland, while the record-shark might be 392 years old even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are more than four metres, known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably determined at the threshold of sexually mature and his age at 156 years was determined, Greenland's shareholding is apparent at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">No coincidence that such methusalemes live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, at the neck a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often runs the organism of the animals living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and albeit slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal affects heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on concentrating as possible as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the early internet era of the internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a couple of months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in Westhaschenformat."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent to that time a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, although queting slowly.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was once again habitable for the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, which resemble climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have resumed similar conditions with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow shift of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to lodge life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average-temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model created a history of Venus that resembled evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the pressway software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates in a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, they will search for long-long-changed files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files, as well as archives files and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the code-key code, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of Crypmalnutrition Bitcoin - above.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is on the game, there are companies for sensible customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consequently, the damage falls from if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of Germany's affected companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent had to fall completely undercut the business, in case of a case people were mortal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals victims were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: pay not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's safety researchers investigated the exploitation of commercial areas and contact with the results: the perpetrators are actually trying to make a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will declare their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And you will redeem private people after payments of a few hundred Euro, companies have to negotiate a hard and five-digit total amount, to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential and relatively risky gains from the ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware for approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools bought for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adapttool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then search for more hackers, to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums on the ground, buying the set of a criminals and instructs the software to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of Ransomware is well known for many companies to secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of firms-IT-responsible for the Malwarebytes database trust, Ransomware can rely on-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful surveys, the perpetrators instead of the release of sensitive data like about customer lists or pricing calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin KlecCynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential of damage according to type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators also may take some new destinations in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonated safety researchers as they were able to get thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a block blocked, the heating so many victims may well be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of the heater to block an entire production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evenings, one dayens eternally around, at night, one is stunned, in the morning the soaping sounding isn't thinking about sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders, and more than ten per cent, do their sleep frequently or permanently restless than restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many reasons underlying it, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, the Executive Board of the German Society for Sheffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands understands, however, is the insomnia, so an entry and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that sleep, many people feel as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German House of Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or polluted factors can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sexual disorder expression of a different disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is particularly frequent with depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are different.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up all two to three hours and may cause womens to face everyday problems and care, gives you an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should we sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week, and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor, oblique Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be very different: one is shut down, tired, unslept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, has irritability or physical pain such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease your sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">When treatment options occur among other things of conduct, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there are hardly any Sleep Sleepers in Germany emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleeping Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems you should turn into the doctor, oblique Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the sleep laboratory, medical advice, for example, when snoring with breaths, in case of illness or if you find the cause of a sleep disorder, says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make no sleep hibernation," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortcut one goes into bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes at the body, one wears a nose, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also records a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions on which you can attach for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Woe count on: regular sleeping and elevation times are not too long in bed, not to sleep long in bed, not watch television for sleeping, alcohol to avoid and at night not at the clock - then you start to get rid of immediately, and that is quite unfavorable.</seg>

<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours that are as a problem could be, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences such as body injury, according to policemen are almost exclusively opposed to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most significant part of the offences do non-damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to controversial 94, cannot be a speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what violence committed, it is important: the people in 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars make it no longer in the Rigaer for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for studying architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the local residents got their road: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly exposed the interpretation of the interpretations of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to move away: characterless new buildings in former building gaps that displace old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are the most important condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can absolutely not guise."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do when a man listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">On all sides of frustration, the police and the inhabitants stalls on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="37">For zooming looking over colour bombers, Kerstin has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who is going on, it should be aware of that - just like anyone who moves into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with pre-names are requested to be called by their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She also is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can see yourself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, Arbeitskreis Refugees, Administration, Authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that your volunteers are more than grateful that Deushale is now, the eiferous wool melee, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less darling than on the multitude of keypassing tasks - meant - as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was searched for a talent with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a eiving wool melee.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not their central area, Annika says Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it goes around organization, work with the people locally, and behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," Regine customer said that Annika is supporting Deushle honest and full-official players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the sink road</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">In connection to the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to teach refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landrata and the Government and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner will offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, administration doesn't find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it has not been used to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes have to be found as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, soon new containers will be installed in the Waterstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is the point of view, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are interns, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine client reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivation and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But this does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a breeding feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers quotas such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump to administration and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to declare the refugees, that it takes you, and you can make sense to time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who feel at some point, he can't help Urbach, would not work and be unprofitable, I will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "problem cases, however, is said to be honest," "" "people, where there is nothing." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two come fear of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "what some naive could call." "" "but a remaining risk could be and will not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They should have fear that the assassination attempt to make it completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, capitals must be held on site and in the region to create activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "they always have in the background that soon a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach." ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, shy away.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is not fair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes a clear fact that Urbacher are already utilized to integrate the hitherto existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in trouble, one can help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
