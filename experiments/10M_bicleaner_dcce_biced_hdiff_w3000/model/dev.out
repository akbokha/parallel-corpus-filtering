Obama is receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not so friendly .
the two wanted to deal with the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it should also turn around the conflict with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the argu@@ ed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ lements of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s def@@ icient will to the peace process .
the deal was further deteri@@ or@@ ated by the Obama &apos;s Iranian nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was able to oppos@@ e Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the Congress of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans a controversial speech , which was carried out as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking with Obama did not speak , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call is professor to have shot his friend
in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ led voice of police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials should come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that family cont@@ acted the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that on a white block was critic@@ ized , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this stood by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , signed , already 300 miles to the school , where he shot and killed another 300 miles to the police at his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ den@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that &quot; University staff had heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said , Lamb has made a fatal score early sometime .
by the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took life when police c@@ lung to him .
a day after the shooting in the university , the students and instru@@ c@@ tors to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as those who knew him who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ab@@ iss died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned himself in a book written by him in whom he mentioned &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both institutes within the Department of Social Sciences and History which included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , said he seemed a bit nervous and nerv@@ ously , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he tells him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for a ur@@ ring for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that Lamb had worked so hard for the Lamb , which would not guarantee an automatic road to an examination as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found the track later Lam@@ bs , as he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ark@@ ansas .
before he was arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why they went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew people who knew there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened his work in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in spring education .
one of the many years old friends of Lam@@ bs signed him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were at High School , and he was the cool elder guy , who tried some years to teach her guitar game .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston said now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that went to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played the one or other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that his daughter writes and sings their own music .
I was a nurse , which worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit Bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that Lamb looked after his guitar and harmon@@ ic aspect ended before an atmosph@@ eric audience .
there was no sign that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the premises and sh@@ ear together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and speci@@ alised in American native people and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of its Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
around 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation on a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight celebration .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vig@@ il , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wagner &apos;s P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected , to be@@ vel that the police had said that Lamb had shot the emergency , when he claimed he was killed in his emergency call as his wife , but there is no indication of the two ones ever married .

Michael J. Fox sh@@ ames his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre around the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aps and an arm length of it being removed with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon states his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen over millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader calls again all parties , including the UN Security Council to join one and inclusive negotiations to finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said in a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member countries of the Council , the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France , on the ver@@ ge of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the Council in the Council and the Regional Assembly , and the Regional Israel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ appro@@ achable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked for the five permanent members in dealing with the crisis in Syria , show the same solidarity and unity to show them with Iran when reaching a nuclear deal .
8 question@@ ing values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw a Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper inc@@ ts with pol@@ ls down , it has not worked ( still ) .
ten of the last eleven National surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to be wonder@@ ing what it means for the nom@@ ination of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ adi@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys returned to the rising leader of Herman Cain , no one of which won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative daily group Club for Growth now ackno@@ wledge Tr@@ ump sum up and start to flow their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current query values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values are turned by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump , his can@@ did@@ acy , announced in mid @-@ June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten predi@@ ct that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are kept in early states .
the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac tuning in I@@ owa has adopted last week that 60 per cent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; v 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in bu@@ zz ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 % of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely acc@@ ust@@ omed to his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of respon@@ dents say to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans that the real estate Mog@@ ul will have the right temper@@ ament for a president , thus ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first US state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that it has the personality of a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively implement his office and almost six out of 10 ad@@ dic@@ ts say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House P@@ asse , as ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters ti@@ acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when they place their hair down , rep@@ ubli@@ can elec@@ torate Tr@@ ump for real .
if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , following a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump sum up the best bet .
it has been a change since the time when four of ten of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P @-@ voters were not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would gain the nom@@ ination , only 28 % for the final candidates to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will show a plau@@ sible project as plau@@ sible .
even when the Republi@@ can rep@@ ublic@@ ans a different candidate , Tr@@ ump still hits almost everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ drop@@ out support is diff@@ using to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvest@@ ed by the majority .
he played 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio played 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , above Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters will support the ump , that they have firmly rejected their votes .
of course , things can happen to change that and nobody can really say anything to change the mind .
46 percent said they were open to the door to change other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they formed their opinion , twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they co@@ inci@@ de with Tr@@ ump at the subject of Im@@ migration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the immig@@ ration and a fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic statement of the Tr@@ ump decisive H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orient@@ able efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they co@@ inci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in issues of immig@@ ration .
as long as the emig@@ ration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump happens to do so .
the fru@@ str@@ ation about the government is climbing up new conditions .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son dis@@ covers about half the supporters of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ sider @-@ side status .
six of the 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post they would rather want a political out@@ sider when working with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious to Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans can be fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; disappeared . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ h@@ oods of Germany
here in the hobby site there is the most expensive complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , there costs a square meter of a hom@@ eless house on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , therefore it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular cli@@ mates will cost one square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student exchange in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ welfare , one of the prices will be like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate company Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ alli@@ ances in a di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several t@@ enth@@ s of one thousand Euros - each square meter , well noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally good at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ comm@@ a thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ sc@@ ab in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller easily has a run .
a happy new match by Thomas Müller would p@@ aving the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus .
a so@@ vereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze managed a dream start in the &quot; Mission of Milan , through FC Bayern .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their stake in the Champions League in the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mul@@ ler dou@@ ble@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth fold in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally go to Munich for the third attempt in the third race .
at his 28th hits in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ leadership , the aid of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart , Roberto , who would pass a Flan@@ agan thought of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium promised before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 h@@ ill@@ ful fans - and the Munich express word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shine .
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bayern was defeated by Greek teams in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams but did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ ageous , but often with their apparent efforts to happen often .
the attacks were led too often by gam@@ ble on the left outside of Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ forced against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right , when his flan@@ ks came from the right se@@ mit@@ one in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half a year .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown , the head ball of Poland passed away from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct arrest , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee were par@@ ed ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although Bavaria moved their usual game , Pir@@ aus could put up con@@ i@@ fers .
but on Tor@@ hil@@ ly Manuel Neuer was however .
so , for example , as a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ ed ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola l@@ ends a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems back in the header , sitting at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC @-@ hero gave a green light only after the last session , Matthias Sam@@ mer said in the Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to do something else is strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola chose him also during the first change when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for chi@@ pped Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , and El@@ f@@ meter made Müller an attempt .
before the game it was come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of tiles in Bavaria fans in their audience block obviously the followers of hosts were prov@@ oked by hosts and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went with stro@@ kes toward the Munich followers .
at least one Bavaria fan was hurt from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , it is not only the lungs , but also the teeth , a Potsdam long@@ term study .
good news : when decre@@ ases , the risk is rapidly decre@@ asing .
smokers have a much increased risk of losing their teeth early .
the long @-@ term study of an international research team emerged , including several employees from the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , about the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ Fa@@ che higher .
more than 23,@@ 300 participants had observed the scientists .
main causes of t@@ ooth@@ ills are c@@ aries and infections of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the relationship between smoking and dent@@ ures therefore go back to frequent ooth@@ ills on smokers .
however , how far smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who were having smoking at smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time , the researchers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing is back on the level of non @-@ smokers , the first author Thomas Dietrich spoke of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one can persu@@ ade people of it , no smo@@ ker , explained university leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings too well to a good dental health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by t@@ ooth@@ less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have pointed out that smoking causes the risk of early age loss .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ merged the findings .
arch@@ ae@@ ologists to@@ alls the Rhein@@ u@@ fer to the rem@@ n@@ ants of the late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time at the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne archaeological finds have been taken .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ ae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
hist@@ ori@@ ans have been on the search for so @-@ called ground monuments since the start of the Rhine .
at all buildings in the city district of Cologne , the museum has always been kept as a specialist for arch@@ ae@@ ological floor care .
the arch@@ ae@@ ologists were now ranked fifth in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards .
from text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood up a church , explained Trier .
beside the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church of Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery with around 350 graves has also been discovered that was probably belonged to the church .

to conclude the trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a vast reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
according to a transparent system , the cont@@ est@@ able private t@@ elecommunic@@ ations equipment for disputes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a clear , more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , the citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on a International Investment Court in the long term .
there could , for example , dispute between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
above all by major companies , the investor @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) were regarded as one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ized by opponents as a type of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ation of the companies to extend tax@@ pay@@ ers to set national laws , or to set a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first opinions received anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act received the proposals from the EU Commission to be in@@ sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was crit@@ ici@@ ally agreed that they do not apply to Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already traded free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Est@@ onian ( SPD ) marked the plans as big progress .
the Commission is making considerable points in the reform of the Federal Minister for the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against controlling the gap of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by way , it says .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will remain un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investment protection has not been deb@@ ated with the United States yet .
the agreement was originally scheduled for the agreement at the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer possible .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
next to him is a flip chart , on which the in@@ ti@@ fier of Michigan has recorded the picturesque U.S. state in Michigan with film sti@@ ft .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly caught by Stev@@ ens .
it tells about different places that he will always record on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were created and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful car@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 2003 released and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ ru@@ ingly composed songs which can be harmonious about American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always be great at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it arises the sm@@ ells , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a disper@@ sed series : each of the 50 US states should be ob@@ sol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet again in 2004 and the vicinity of the Rhine is already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and has spot@@ ted a positive expectations .
Stev@@ ens is reduced here .
live @-@ enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
in 2005 , with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens In@@ v@@ ites You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide master@@ piece was published in 2005 .
hidden in ideas and sty@@ list@@ ic fin@@ esse .
the album also entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any year list of the influ@@ ential music media .
according to extremely productive experiment , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales .
this sixth session album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but supported by programming sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs has been hi@@ ked , the stage shows on the colourful spectac@@ le of Neon @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens tou@@ red through Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in dark ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
The@@ aters mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March .
although nearly 2000 guests are ban@@ ished in their chairs , the far more mature Stev@@ ens returns back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the band played excellent musicians through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience can hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can cast away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to addition , Stev@@ ens would like to be modest , plays an audi@@ ble few older songs and eventually p@@ inc@@ ts with appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut with tension for the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions and enter David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise in order to ask the first of his six @-@ given questions just about noon , whereby his performance from the media is likely to be inspected close by the media .
he called &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he can skip a few sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ops and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour leader , prov@@ oked by a commemor@@ ative ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS will be prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Royal Air Force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , spoke in the BBC Two news@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the shade @-@ ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they are called in dis@@ agreements with the economy , def@@ ending and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent correspon@@ dent announces that political differences are also stack@@ ed within the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s expres@@ sions to the European Union and the bo@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes have set out to remove all the idea of a limit in total .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of employment and pen@@ sion@@ ers , said that the party &quot; is very clear &quot; is that they are only against governmental plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been the T@@ ory leader , across the &quot; Dis@@ patch &quot; in Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised a different polit@@ ician , said that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the parliamentary results of the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ orious , and that it has made both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and spreading it out instead of serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by econom@@ ists , will participate in the shadow , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea in conversation , that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the company home to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is often associated with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics , which is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he acknowledged that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she was sent first in 1990 on TV , the survey was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require further reforms .

pound goes through accelerated labor market growth in the UK
the pound has risen mark@@ edly after the data that has an increase in pay@@ roll growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the earnings without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew from 2.9 % over the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the fastest and estimated assessment of interest rates since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % from the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the leading share in the market and made a 20 % jump after the tak@@ eover of the ri@@ val AB in@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were due to encour@@ aging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - back growth .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E rose by 5 % after the min@@ oc@@ ese harvest said that he took $ 2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the biggest loser in the index , namely , with a 4.3 % decline , since Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold its appreciation for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports has increased by 3.1 % after earning a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages increase its expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this department would issue the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could also make its expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster depicting Leban@@ ese on potato @-@ woofer
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are both - in the potato @-@ woofer , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Irish owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the pro@@ verb &quot; The potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and flesh put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a grill sk@@ e@@ wer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile brought home to the Leban@@ ese embassy in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers the culinary international understanding also come well .
Met@@ cash launches clearance @-@ level campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - decline
Met@@ cash tries to protect IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance into South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di will prepare the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ inst@@ ream marketing and commerci@@ alization over the social media , as well as events like Adelaide .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice@@ berg Simm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ borough , who distributed in IG@@ A @-@ Shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers , who sell f@@ aded tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence bud@@ gets on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers negoti@@ ate for food , alcohol , and equipment .
it is a lot in the game , because South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ cade IG@@ A @-@ stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally lay@@ ered and IG@@ A retailers can have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts believe that at least five percent of the food market in these two countries , anal@@ ysts believe that Al@@ di will take away five percent of food market in these two countries , but mainly individual retailers can take away sales .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath &apos;s analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath is estimated by Morgan Stanley that IG@@ A @-@ retail@@ er could lose 360 million sales per year and cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA in the next year , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and at the amounts of Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed base could cost Met@@ cash about $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market share in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IG@@ A @-@ One was the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is located at 3.8 percent in the food and grocery store , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , marks the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income derived from met@@ cas@@ cade and food trading , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , resulting in operating debt reduction in sales and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ aler distributor but , however , is investing more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with hundreds of products every week and to improve their shops due to faster growing , fresh food and to deliver better sel@@ ections of residential @-@ label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ ks &apos;s main managing business Ian Mor@@ rice says that these price adjustments and load re@@ stores are expected to get into Elan and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ved more praise for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and earns his praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is going to be called &quot; Special KS &quot; by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinn@@ ati , after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison set down twice by the ump@@ ire , where Harrison set out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have had to suggest that I should strike your child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he broke a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp had crushed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Coc@@ kin@@ ab@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I am going to offer me quite a bit , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was stri@@ pped in the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ t in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ str@@ ation with herself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t have any problem with the other players , he is training hard ; he is well educated in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider C@@ yr@@ gios about the most important decision to take place on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he guarantees the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra when a long @-@ long permanent element is returning to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first of all we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not all the vers@@ at@@ oms around the surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick very quickly made the asc@@ ension , what &apos;s going to get to the public , and he doesn &apos;t deserve to support him , but we try to make him the consequences of his doing so . at some time out of the spotlight , I think it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency gap , close the border , with@@ holding refugees away
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the not@@ ch and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attemp@@ ted illeg@@ ally to come to the country . everything with the aim to stop the flow of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos began on the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian public officials were re@@ acted with empire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who were fled before violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police @-@ helicopter above them sh@@ web@@ ded , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against Hungarian read@@ iness police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some meadows from protest food and water back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants are sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels decided not to agree on joint immig@@ ration policy .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people , who finally sought refuge in the over@@ taken Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that in the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , won &apos;t put his hopes upon a forth@@ coming route of Brussels or his neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Emer@@ gency La@@ un@@ ites announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities to combat the crisis so that they could remove roads and acceler@@ ate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the immigrants from migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it has completed a fence on the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates launched at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary became a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has passed that most of the coming economic refugees are in search of a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also bear higher prison pun@@ ishments for convicted traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on day .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , state @-@ security counsel for Or@@ ban said that authorities 45 people caught up the border , 15 others were already pushing deeper into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are possible to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials took part in the Tuesday morning to two of the seven limit trans@@ itions with Serbia after a rail wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the boundaries .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to re @-@ modify the data of people , to push for a crowd .
there were about 20 to come in , but thousands remain outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
vote for 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the fight against the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent increase ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den who hasn &apos;t announced yet , if he en@@ vis@@ es for the presidential ship , receives support of 15 percent of the elec@@ torate of the presidential elections .
more than five months prior to the start of the preceding elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands for which candidates should support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent than one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups in a number of demo@@ graphic groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and women , but these jumps have decre@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their support in men has dropped below , and S@@ anders is only at 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s benefit among democratic voters under the age of 50 has been vol@@ atile , and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton still has a huge margin in the older voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month , Clinton was confron@@ ted with a double @-@ digit advance at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the US voters are nation@@ ally speaking that they would support with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some advice and support further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially impressed by her .
the views are stronger with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them excited .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the not@@ ion that it is time that a woman president will be ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
members of Clin@@ tons are also mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the voters are cited .
since the vice president goes a potential for the Presi@@ dential Council , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it .
when a democratic elec@@ torate of the local elections are asked , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
men of Clin@@ tons say more than half that bid@@ ders would be their second choice far before S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides , not for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton flew an advantage over s@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters will see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has sun@@ k 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has gone by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that has seen him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting rights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , during the question , what is more important at a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters call questions about voters .
similarly as in the last month there is not a single demo@@ c@@ rat@@ cial candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pres@@ election as un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Candi@@ date or potential candidates make good results in some important features in voters of their party elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den are considered tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy and strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the lead in the three candidates at hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
the Democratic elec@@ torate of the pres@@ ets appear in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions on Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office , most of the Democratic elec@@ tors are pleased with their explanation in the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was turned to light , split .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail @-@ contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general views of Clinton , despite 36 percent said that their opinion of her was deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 that are worse by Clinton .
although the vote of the party is considered tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the vote they do not hold for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the coun@@ sell@@ able nation@@ ally also see Tr@@ ump but not tru@@ thful and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good marks under guidance .
out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will benefit most in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t have any opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 DRC voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to National survey near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is just under the latest survey by C@@ BS news / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump .
meanwhile , half of the voters around the new pol@@ l have fallen in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters support nationwide pl@@ ump in large numbers . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey which was conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the pol@@ l also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demo@@ graphic groups and hits the same hits with university education in demo@@ graphic groups .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , was killed with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who is fallen in the deepest month , with 10 % support for the last month up to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place with 6 % .
the error mar@@ es for the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the pol@@ ls - it ends with 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump to Car@@ son .
having a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some side effects for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa .
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently under temperatures of up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient to present a hot water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a real pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are not able to go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea , this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
but at the same time the Mediterranean offers even the Mediterranean Sea : it even occurs up to 29 degrees in the East .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in France , 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes down to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings bur@@ dened
nearly two years after a student passed during a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ ain will be accused of accused of five persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood have attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an introduc@@ tory rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police divided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials reported that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand and was repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , he then fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ ge did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , said Chief of Police Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members decided to hide goods and set the welfare of the bro@@ therhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ sign@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after the aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ban@@ anas in the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
fra@@ ctions and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a indictment for murder and third members for the first five members .
two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , will also be indicted for criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not just want to take responsibility for the individuals only , but if there is an organization that has officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , so we will also assign it to account@@ ability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner believes in a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed will increase interest
a tur@@ tle is coming , and the house will slip into the re@@ plen@@ ishment , ra@@ ges on bonds , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will last , and how long will it take .
in particular , the history of the economy is only minor guidance for the process .
a recession came up in just 11 months following the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ sion of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of US Central Bank have stressed the fact that investors should not concentrate on making interest rates , rather than the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization .
multiple variables play a role in fact .
however , in the end , market participants could determine that all the f@@ elling could possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ itable to be interpreted by a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to se@@ duce a shock to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends , based on how some areas of business could react :
as seen in the market last month , the gain of interest rate things can do things for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase is applied , the influence cannot be dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s apparently a tendency to ensure total assets under 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study on what has happened at the f@@ ooth@@ ills of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly been in the up@@ swing trend - approximately 14 percent - on the path to the interest rate , quite flat in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average margin in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent compared to a current analysis done by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment @-@ Strat@@ ege at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the enh@@ ancing cycle and its return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest elev@@ ations often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not acceler@@ ate it before and could acceler@@ ate a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that GDP will be near its lowest point at a low @-@ rate increase in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 market interest rates since 1950 has only spent twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticip@@ ate that this will continue and anticip@@ ate the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed net , just 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest income for a so frag@@ ile economic setting could ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made themselves the whole year on a two @-@ rate holding of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week which ends on Thursday .
as many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade gives only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increases cycles of 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing demand of GDP took place and pre @-@ reception very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was in the observed stage .
the current cycle is by far the longest being maintained by the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ atile , as the market att@@ ends a rate of interest and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares , if they change their strategic course .
in bonds the revol@@ ts seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lower@@ ing in cycle seems .
at the end of the inc@@ eption , the bond tra@@ ps immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the rise in the interest rates will result , that yields between longer and shorter cuts lead to a curve of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , even though &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ anal@@ ysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interesting is , Jones is saying that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the power of the dollar and the decline of inflation there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the yield curve has gone , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility increased - all the market characteristics when the F@@ ed expands its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large and entire company , companies that advance the larger part of their business activity in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
mult@@ in@@ ational companies with high debts are po@@ orer , as an upward dollar spent their products on the global market and also enh@@ ancing the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equ@@ ates to react very positively three months after an initial inc@@ lin@@ ation to react very positively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ anal@@ ysts said in an account for the clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital rati@@ os as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share of shares , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits through higher earnings , even if experts are different , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards , and said they only im@@ itate The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins , causing the voice to the voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Parliament board and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do what the navig@@ ator doesn &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ um@@ mets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly not increasing by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; digest@@ s &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began in the last year , seem to be just under a different name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you are just the im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC @-@ General Vice @-@ General pointed out and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far before his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I &apos;m from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which really is un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music can be found and new works on behalf , that &apos;s what I really think is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder to work to engage the public as it did in the past because the Br@@ its are less inform@@ ing about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only one of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports , led to the commercial ri@@ vals to get to the feet .
T@@ ory MP Lady Dam@@ ien Collins , the Voice of the Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
see why this program is often deb@@ ated , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall in@@ sist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; was produced on special BBC websites . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from the voice of The Voice in the future or give money of the fee for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose to the slow@@ est on net sales in August and the Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
within the last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has hin@@ dered the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping m@@ alls had bo@@ red , and many of Britain &apos;s flagship stores have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are evidence that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sale of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , as a purch@@ aser , started to make purchases of his mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we might experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for em@@ itting sales .
experts believe that buyer will hold their purchases on this occasion , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers in order to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites cut off .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers will fight for bar@@ gains , buyers of them could retain their purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium discovered that £ 5 spending will be issued a little more than £ 1 .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of bra@@ do@@ cking in the interior .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials have already confirmed that H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue to enter into town with thousands that will continue to enter .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , should not stand the arm of the crane , when it was not used .
an Arab version of Dec@@ ree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the news of the news agency in English reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited abroad .
in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man ob@@ jected to reveal what the overthrow of the cranes pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come before the H@@ add@@ sch which is later to be met in this month .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified art@@ is@@ ans from Eastern Europe has got an increase in

it is said that Brit@@ ons carry forth their hamm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European professionals who carry out the work in their home .
if you fit done with a hammer or a brush to painting the walls , they apparently belong to a minority .
because Brit@@ ons employ more art@@ is@@ ans to accomplish home jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ bearing chain , said that it has now been a huge increase in number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe , providing services to low@@ lands and meanwhile .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other screens to set up min@@ art@@ is@@ ans and include 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten merchants at the shop are hit by women .
at the moment , they were silent for the men .
she said it is necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must make this stronger towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients are affected by women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the five leading companies listed on a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed below , has also cont@@ acted its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher announces a decline in semi @-@ annual profit and res@@ ets after the Group secured the costs for closing of the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q features , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faith@@ fulness
the Provincial Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt took place on Wednesday two functional parts of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ I / DO@@ B .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority .
of this alle@@ g@@ ation he was justified in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Colonel Hans Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel proved to prove that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of agreements that were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
he consum@@ es the damage with about 400@@ ,000 euros .
sporting activities are also charged with financial mar@@ es .
this fact , the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the in@@ dis@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense stated that the association was not part of a property .
the sports officials only have been charged for damages and the sports club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in which they have invested a lot of time and money from the debt . Pas@@ si@@ va was around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; then we stood before the situation : do we continue our club or lock ourselves ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread g@@ amer of the financial markets .
with his co @-@ colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fired money to depos@@ ited our life insurance for security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the recording . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , there are only no debts to be made .
Moreover , the payment of re@@ payment has been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 due to the financial success of the financial compensation .
therefore one part of wages paid only years later , namely , from 2003 , as a plus on the account has been paid out .
consequently , the former Ob@@ mann app@@ re@@ ed , and not detailed bookings can be explained .
the accounts and au@@ ditions were administered by the two accused , the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not opened in detail , the judge asked .
the association has not been interested in the funding for financial affairs , only important to debt free , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an official investigation began against the abuse of authority , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement .
these were back , the accused declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known in the Society according to his testimony .
&quot; why ? &quot; she wanted to know the judge .
I did not know the answer for a long time .
finally , he thought he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the public prosec@@ utor was in the space .
the co @-@ accused should be informed , the func@@ tionary of the function .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; damage @-@ repar@@ ation . &quot;
why acci@@ dental aid ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
it declared the first accused , that he did not agree with this wording , because the society was never caused of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tail@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ am I a legal agent ? , &quot; he asked .
much said the func@@ tionary , he never got a cent content related , he charged only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he was charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual expense , however , have been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not able to show the accused .
these are according to an operating check that has been judged correctly , no longer kept , explained them .
mil@@ eage was also referred to in the second person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all surveys are be made in cash , to stay at the Bank for Blei@@ burg from his home country , he explained in his asser@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for US emergency
the world is observed when the US emergency tank consisted of two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates will be lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were question@@ ed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do this even last week , now that the F@@ ed will continue to wait somewhat longer and interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be observed .
it &apos;s a historical event since it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates to NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leader at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars to be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the less rough outlook on global circumstances .
she has warned of markets , but the signs indicate that the signs indicate that such a step are good .
the final decision should be announced at 08.@@ 00 CET on Thursday
death Sp@@ ice at the Delta State University left sorry
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the shooting and killing of his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague and killed Sh@@ annon Lamb a note to tell him that he wanted to do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could cause it to happen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police at G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social sciences at the Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he was shot on someone , and one killed man .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency call , that police sent police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but nobody will inter@@ fere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably to be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers of his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police found the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday night when police officers took him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ angular Rel@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been married by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who had been married about seven years when a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss have had a daughter who was 19 , and it was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , after statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had been using Lamb for approximately three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb added relatives at a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers took him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb opened his car on the side , fled to walking , ran into the woods and killing himself with a shot .
Lamb obtained a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , how his lifestyle will be based on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lufthansa is planning a large group of corporate restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa Group will save half a billion euros in year alone with a better organization .
the Group &apos;s workplace is 150 of the world &apos;s total of 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot @-@ union there are in@@ des of new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa reaches its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the tr@@ illion Euro@@ wings .
the Re@@ organization &apos;s goal is to profit a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and rede@@ em@@ sy@@ ner@@ gies then shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board in the Lufthansa operating business .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as autonomous as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ o@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future .
on the new arrival , Sp@@ o@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group aims to compete with Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organisation of the company &apos;s 120 000 associates was complex .
the airlines operates under the name of the Passage &quot; group , the three quarters of annual turnover of € 30 billion .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven a double correction of his right B@@ one .
while this brought the left outer def@@ enders to tears , and let him close him for at least six months , Louis van G@@ aal didn &apos;t give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van G@@ aal said , &quot; He has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he will later re@@ loc@@ ating a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing chamber , he got a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it takes six months and it will not be playing in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of an El@@ b@@ room to escape .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has no pun@@ ishing the Mexican .
van G@@ aal believes that the Italian arbit@@ rator had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were ob@@ sol@@ ete .
it &apos; was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ aked to Sha@@ w &apos;s account , &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe what I am broken , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
here on : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
the British def@@ enders took an additional inc@@ en@@ tive in France with the European Championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place in violation of the place , everyone is very sad .
it &apos;s never int@@ ent to hurt our player , to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how to feel it , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child is a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he asked of a provider of child care systems , his favorite kid &apos;s book was asked to call himself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it seems always to have missed an image or message that we have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything nice and well done except that the following sales figure , in which Cameron said the action of the book , describes a summar@@ ies of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to enlarge the fairly short original text .
&quot; amid@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , a boy named Ted , who has been able to see a real tree , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if that &apos;s not yet susp@@ icious , the text by Cameron interpre@@ ts itself as partially as the Sum@@ mary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air a commod@@ ity is , hopes that a boy named Ted , hopes to capture the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron explo@@ ded the action of the book as a little while the local environmental takes place in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ent@@ ative Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , gre@@ edy nature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaking woman said that the text was probably come from the Camer@@ ons Regional Office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons was delivered , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exter@@ mination of England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
when we encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the header to choose England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks page may be more than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the zeit@@ geist is strong ; they won &apos;t wear an@@ ars of 2012 , just a young @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een has evolved as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , an option for the attack .
this news related news : Adam Ly@@ th is coming from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course to analyze as his boss bike in Yorkshire , hard .
in its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ops are alig@@ ned on results .
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out more races for Yorkshire , another chance will come .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss will lob@@ ster for his post@@ ure , even if he did not make such good achievements , and not surprised me ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to get his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven od@@ ds - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to return home and down@@ wards .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation that man can lift was that England first depos@@ ited Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in high form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke that I really cher@@ ish .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker , which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when it was 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which made us feel very much .
he must have at least the same chances as they are in front of him , but it naturally depends on the team effort in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of putting Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , give some extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four Qu@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist can &apos;t beat there , and this link has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cricket players .
Mo@@ een did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger took his first 38 tests at the first drop before being in the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred ranks immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the box as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my restricted way he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on an average of 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England made a few smart additions at the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a master@@ coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing room , even if the news are in line with the previously sent .
col@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar pause to Australia and I had no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with the players , your jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .
the Bre@@ xit at Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit ) from Britain &apos;s EU ) could gain momentum , when the economy arises in a fl@@ au@@ te until 2017 .
David Camer@@ ons un@@ equi@@ zed new business strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was torn apart for Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ ak said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some member states that are deeply shocked in various crises such as the EU is now and not always from his own gu@@ ilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ faced agenda , which they usually don &apos;t want to have satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not be possible if they end@@ ure the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers ch@@ iming at Summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a picture of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win ally for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who was looking for out@@ so@@ be@@ ating Britain within the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Berlin - and with more short @-@ sigh@@ ted minister and civil servants in some major cities until the point is , at which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is one ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them how to do so for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation period such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re@@ election or en@@ forcement in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned power .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are getting a leg , to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ den@@ cies have .
as a result , some such ministers take no mention un@@ helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums to acceler@@ ate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the new hearing was a ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the new business . &quot;
the Europeans know how cool the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they did not support it during the course of Tony Ben@@ n in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ un@@ ities , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew with all his re@@ treats , who were his enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fri@@ d@@ ling sc@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ hack@@ ing aliens and the P@@ seudo @-@ In@@ ians , who own most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about them , but realized that , if you sit down with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him , rather than to serve lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more of more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle of the EU &apos;s speech , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press has never forgiven him that .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he no time needed for me - seems to repeat at risk , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ yk@@ ici@@ dal &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ 80 years .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll put it very friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a reform EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ on@@ ari@@ al tendency and the wild Ge@@ fel@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ english changing can probably say Yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns would not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n was an appointment of provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler had a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rem@@ inded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father fought on TV , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ ett@@ in , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ i phr@@ ase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and members after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what always wants to medi@@ ate in the head @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - think that he even touched me - news discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding area of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron to give credit card for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours assistance in the refer@@ end@@ ums for a self @-@ understanding , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns is fundamental to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist discussion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , who is a central base of dog@@ mat@@ ric disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its risks to Nato - Tom Watson , L@@ C will be convinced that J@@ C will not go to the outlet - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of its su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn away political funds - they also have a susp@@ icious elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all of these can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the USA are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on power , what was remin@@ is@@ cent of the German In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum at the start of Monday .
experts critic@@ ising public health England about e @-@ cigarettes
the claims of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined to critic@@ ise those of the public health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical professional journal Lanc@@ et last month for@@ b@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expecting the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the method and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce a synthesis report on the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products . the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously obtained by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also signed the BA@@ T references for public health in a sustainability report .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to get funding from an E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he shall have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the committee will not be delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other atten@@ de@@ es at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he also took part in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the claims of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes have been used as a road to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said he had already re@@ acted on the alle@@ g@@ ations of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second long lif@@ esp@@ an dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to public@@ ise the public about what the proof is and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking is the National Health System £ 2 bn per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by defin@@ ing current evidence , that e cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we represent our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC was to give up East@@ En@@ ders , former boss of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC meant to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give her right arm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio set should only be used to make the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK broad@@ casts .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , most controversial period for the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ itters , like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC does exist or sends , which would be clearly shown by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee on the future of BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which is in the medium or long term , do not consider the production at least on programs that do not make or order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , it is non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a ruling tax program financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give it to your right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this is to be public @-@ tim@@ ed TV .
I do not believe this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , led for Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC believes in the hunt for evaluations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of men who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts went back to what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows were to sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal agen@@ ic programs could go to BB@@ C4 , but they are unable to measure the audience , but they can ar@@ gue if they have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember , we all think that for 150 £ per year get a great value , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will examine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a little bit of BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it &apos;s 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio and Canada , for example , take this change in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will go in order to make everything online available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have cultivated lit@@ ters with genet@@ ically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by le@@ aps of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction in which they have sound im@@ pulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard are ir@@ radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to respond to the membrane channels that react ultr@@ asonic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers , which wor@@ ms , showed the power of a new procedure called son@@ ogen@@ etics , which can be used as ultrasound to activate a number of bra@@ in@@ - , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the Deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease treatment .
aden@@ os@@ ul@@ ators do not react ultr@@ asonic , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did so when they were surrounded by fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultrasound shaft work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the cells .
sound waves act the opening of these icons , and enable the cells to be assigned to such a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of its Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 strip
when he turns ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and switch to the wor@@ ms where they turn the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities to Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a pione@@ ering tool enabling scientists to activate and activate neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which must be sent down to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound sensors can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make an ultrasound signal for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creative director Matt Le@@ ver was aston@@ ished about the silence that was around the advertising for the arms trade fair - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ an advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by feeding with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a united in the British government and guarantee that torture cannot be illegal in front of our door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from within the area of Excel , where exhibitors gain fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ist products .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I recall the cl@@ amped smile of those who I have upset - and on the numerous , long @-@ known complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be dist@@ illed in eight easy rules .
the student residence in the halls reaches from slightly anno@@ ying to absolute fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to z@@ wat@@ ering : people tell that where you come from where you come and where you have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , boys , it &apos;s just a he@@ fe@@ extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through you .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your lashes were caught in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people often transform into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
here &apos;s related : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student houses build a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship further , but you must go away so that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , try to feel when a compromise is exhausted by sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
ap@@ rop@@ os Ank@@ lo@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with B@@ aking .
as you begin the plain on the peak of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to make you smile . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ om@@ mates feel comm@@ ited to enter@@ tain and will perhaps associate your face with a marv@@ ell@@ ous surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
bad cre@@ eps out of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , when you purchase sleeping .
to steal food , is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
now check it with the dairy .
chances are good that they say to own self , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to deal with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added a fl@@ ushing water to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , getting people from sleep or from work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you are in the true sense of pro@@ ver@@ bs to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl on my corridor asked their neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them something special , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
she responded to the music again .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours had kindly agreed to sleep two hours before she had pl@@ agu@@ ed their own music , shut up her door and went to her three @-@ hour audit .
would it not be romantic if your future partner would look at random in the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be ab@@ sen@@ sible if you keep a resident for your future sp@@ ouse , close them , separate , and should live there every day and perhaps , how to bring together all common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the heart goes his own way - but when a hot fellow is definitely not your future wife partner@@ in , try to talk about your sub@@ ju@@ b a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has left its keys in his not closed room , the border between Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is one when it seems .
a good thing is funny , but it only takes moments , until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never mind someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which places you then into the freezer - but if you had any poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ handed , straight service
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building a lot of money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Ter@@ raced houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ mer@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can still build and building good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the residential community .
the entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly your homes can be created : he builds a project raced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the residential community .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here to a great extent here .
given the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the coming decades .
a quite common , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : one ter@@ raced house needs at least place .
it reli@@ eves the integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses built straight into the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is again peace , I go back .
the houses can then be re@@ constructed according to specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house adds to 184 000 Euro , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is reasonable .
did the construction work complic@@ ate their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legally , I have accomplished my project correctly .
it always makes the im@@ min@@ ishing Dam@@ oc@@ codi@@ sch@@ y special construction and the slot order .

it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a cage , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is plenty of room .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local people react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but are you not anno@@ ying the competition for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , yet , we had a boom in the last five years in Germany , but it &apos;s luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or of the Ger@@ ing@@ mer@@ Mer@@ er .
I show how you can still build and building good today .
that &apos;s why it is .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Android &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app , and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , then the phone gives you the option to download and install it .
some are pushed after installation , as they get an error , that make sure the &quot; software update fail . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght look back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so , but Apple has to do so if you use a special tool to install apps and then re@@ install , once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging device , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the upgrade will continue on half way and may result in a break@@ age of updates .

it was sympathy on first sight when she met Frank Müller &apos;s first sight before Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her studies of specialist education in a dener , who also wants to climb into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mül@@ lers were good at this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ itt@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot;
the couple of married couple liked the idea of running its own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Mül@@ lers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house@@ man .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy now comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and intensity EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of € 500@@ 00 will receive the Mül@@ lers in the scope of a funding program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .

according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice at the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no new candidate would have found , it would have gone .
he who visits the Mül@@ lers &apos;s talk session but will also look ahead to trusted faces : will the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the field stand .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf , an era , after all , the medicine has practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen .
after the long time , they feel a little pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband was comple@@ mentary : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed myself with gar@@ dening and now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the couple has loved two grand@@ son and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are high off at our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
it is clear , however , that everyone who wants to ask for asylum , can also be &quot; granted . &quot;
the supply and safety of the people rises in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear signals needed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less mig@@ rations , either from the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia would deny
the Croatian government had previously communic@@ ated to travel to Slovenia as well as Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and there are also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
but this obviously did not see the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - inten@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia may be strongly controlled as the outer edge of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ e wants to invest its limits for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; every EU member must complete its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
just like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already attemp@@ ted to arrive in the night of night to Tuesday , in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to escape the registration .
the Croatian police could sei@@ ze it in the near corn@@ erst@@ one .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have ever arrived in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Sy@@ rer and Afghan , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross already are in use .
in the coming days , his country anticip@@ ates some 4,000 refugees , &quot; Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would be transferred to the Hungarian border to the Hungarian border , who had previously managed the Hungarian border between Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade anticip@@ ate that it was wise to adop@@ t certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor will we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , on the morning , there was a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , more buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been traveling through Serbia all night from around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police said we are going to come hi@@ ther , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might be , in fact , to see the previous shift in the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
in Croatia , Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , before , emphas@@ ises that his country prepared for the fall of a strong supply of refugees for possible exter@@ mination camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not report it , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one perform rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have no good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of the border controls .
on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence around 300 refugees were fixed .
according to the media reports , she spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border controls Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic therefore tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local he@@ pat@@ itis in Hor@@ gos : he stop the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not have been going to deal with very high refugee levels .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers rate migrants to - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ gh@@ s
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute best refugees in which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not in@@ dangerous : there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there are still un@@ spacious mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went to the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and over again , on the outskirts of little discussions on the action , over life to deal with death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I am making sure that the end of this world comes to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , who is co @-@ association with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Cancer Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , this public @-@ effective action was good for 20 year olds .
that not everyone wants to communicate in the tablets , however , is under@@ stand@@ able , finally , it is a very personal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of death and death is still adher@@ ed to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , who has just contributed much to the Hosp@@ ital@@ movement in recent years that people will open . &quot; &quot; &quot;

faced by a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers looked at volunteers , she immediately reported that it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ ya &apos;s roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ant in private households , hospitals , fo@@ ster homes , and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that , however , expect earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company benefits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for Holiday Season employment were announced one day later than the current ri@@ val to UPS , that plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million dollar spent , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just beyond the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of the @-@ acks investment research question@@ ed anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
anal@@ ysts asked six of them anal@@ ysts anticip@@ ated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a drop in international priority shipping which resulted in sales in his unity of express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , turnover during the body transport rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue owing to higher prices during the result of higher labour costs in freight operations .
in pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares are reduced by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,15 .
on Tuesday they included 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most expected meeting in the years spend the Federal Reserve and strateg@@ ically sitting two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it is time to lift the lead for the first time since almost a decade .
above all over them at an end of inde@@ xed , two @-@ story session sa@@ ws , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold commission from the congress : maxim@@ ize the U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that it gives an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate , if the X @-@ factor might be in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to w@@ ail off the current short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy is showing that it grows largely , the most recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets may even intensi@@ fy the most careful F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , to intensi@@ fy the rate of interest for federal loans - and is it just around a quarter per@@ cent@@ ric point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Che@@ f@@ economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , increased in@@ security around the global market is enough just@@ ification , to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do is un@@ sure of itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been question@@ ed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a rate of interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait a long @-@ awa@@ ited F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , it is that the strateg@@ ist alle@@ ges the strike by promise that another boost is far away .
Dow Jones experienced average overall average of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 on Tuesday .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy pursued the proposition in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that date , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets as they act in@@ security whenever the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the set by 0,@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of the mon@@ et@@ ular conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had in spring and early summer said that in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als this year , that &apos;s why more economic progress would be necessary , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years , and close to the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and even though inflation went steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives had said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Wol@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would thr@@ ush global growth .
the market has recovered something in this month , the Dow Jones is now nearly 10 % below the h@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ence aff@@ ecting the complex lim@@ estone as to raise interest to interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events were not in the financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says ahead , that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable information that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
global economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end effect the F@@ ed currency of the world has become the world .
the influence of central bank has grown enorm@@ ously in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ amped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expansion , dissolved fu@@ sions around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are inter@@ woven , we can monitor from the F@@ ed representatives that they can not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also with other central banks and experts , to maintain a better understanding for the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her decision @-@ making is &apos; more art than science , &apos; said Zac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a history of excess reactions to financial market movement , apparently linked to the financial Fund@@ ament@@ ally data . &quot;
varn@@ ishing , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de@@ compos@@ es for an interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia made the F@@ ed to reduce its lead points by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited notable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives stopped these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of the financial stability just during a severe crisis like the market square in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the committee for interest in the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il are not coming near this level , he said .
&quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation that they are afraid of a cra@@ ft@@ ist threat , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , and does not mention the financial stability , and until that &apos;s changed , I don &apos;t think they should be in the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to them a warm welcome , doesn &apos;t go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a whole series of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Brazilian Women &apos;s Pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande protects nutrition for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ate women how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that are rep@@ ain@@ ted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients you need to build a strong immune system .
because of additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories consumed by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mothers should carry mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , the child may have a negative effect on the child &apos;s immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese gy@@ ms
the church of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,3 million Euros co@@ stly sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be sh@@ al@@ ded to the solar system .
the planning stages for the long @-@ lasting turn@@ ber@@ ation at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre continues step by step : in the youngest municipal council , the expanded building application has been unanim@@ ously approved .
prior to this , the Panel had decided on an application for a statutory &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
in the exception &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit permission for a special form regarding the roof structure .
a &quot; saddle ru@@ ach with non @-@ mit@@ ig@@ matic first and roof top should be constructed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar energy systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we get a wonderfully large at@@ ed@@ roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again around the roof of energy , due to energetic reasons - differently than in the planning plan - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus greatly reduced .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning plan does not have any &quot; exceptions &quot; - the Bern@@ rie@@ ds Joint in general are rather restri@@ c@@ tive by the rule of liberation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is no recur@@ ring project at the gym : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ent problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym is a community project of the community and the SV Bern@@ hardt &apos;s community centre .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs .
grants are expected by school and automobile transport funding .
in the course of proce@@ eding , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall is now presented to the coun@@ cill@@ or for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed in early as planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new physician at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees prefer by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county seat of the county , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
a decision on this will be the Supervisory Board , and he agre@@ es to the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority were to move by fishermen and the further existing inside of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who cannot be offered with S@@ ong@@ au , is supposed to be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now being transferred to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the question who will take the suc@@ cession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he was willing to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each case and a dis@@ semin@@ ation of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
G@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is speci@@ alised on the inside of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , fisher@@ man with his team , if the supervisory board is intended to comply with both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city which has still more than 35 beds are finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current reconstruction is completed in W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ en@@ ät@@ ter@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , reported rum@@ ors , w@@ on@@ ach the house , which is owned by the Federal State Coun@@ cill@@ or , will be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll close . &quot; as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say that there are several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short period of treatment of Car@@ itas and a psych@@ ambi@@ sych@@ iat@@ rie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen to us , such a chance does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fisher@@ man over the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch that was received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which fisher@@ man has worked as chief for more than 30 years , has not been given .
he was asked to take care of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) in recent decades has been threatened with closure , sections were closed , for example , surgery and birth aid .

Jag@@ dar@@ me with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor @-@ drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ is@@ ures on Tuesday afternoon by feet .
during the super@@ st@@ ition on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use as the police split .
after a donation of a donation , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were placed in hospitals .
just how it could happen to the accident , it was un@@ clear at first .
the crime police have been determined .
missing 16 @-@ year old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ icious police led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz ( Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate ) .
in the hearing of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their bodies have been thrown into a row in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was a victim of violent crimes in the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police run on Wednesday .
on Tuesday evening he was also a member of 20 @-@ year old , who according to the fact that he was pointing out and led the investig@@ ator to the place of bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having been back home on the eve of an Autumn season in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed at home .
in search of young woman , the investig@@ ators initially asc@@ end to personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
the mis@@ conception at the friends of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ance of the missing buildings resulted in a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rators then led the police to a channel in rock , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities arrested that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the dead bodies have put it in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be submitted to the o@@ at@@ ow@@ ser on Wednesday , investig@@ ators gave him a burden to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decision on the close circumstances of action should bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing
the situation on the German accommodation market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek an affordable stay .
the printing on the residential market is growing .
social housing is a challenge .
the distribution struggle on the German residential market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and unemployed from the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the bond on behalf of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Hou@@ sehold We@@ alth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , in Germany there are 26@@ 0,000 units of work .
this covers 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer committed after the first three months of their stay considered asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency accommodation housing .
many encounter the apartment market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes before the rental apartments .
according to statistics of Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in last year .
the negative development of the apartment market is , however , not only to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also represents considerable fail@@ ures in the H@@ ousing policy of recent years .
Germany ow@@ es a rental deficit which is greater than a year ago .
currently , in the metrop@@ olitan areas around 77@@ 0,000 units were already notified , Matthias Günther , investig@@ ates the study .
therefore , many professionals lived in large capit@@ als , in WG rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ comfortable because of the dol@@ drums on the residential community for longer at &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the capit@@ als , the number of square metres per head has sun@@ k again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are supposed to boost their social housing .
this could be om@@ itted to the purchase tax and the basic tax is exposed for funded housing .
according to the alliance , an attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation is necessary .
the programme for refugee accommodations of the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W guarantees right now in cities and municip@@ alities .
a good week after the launch , 184 million euros had been given already more than half of the costs made available at 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia have one corridor
practically no way to Hungary is almost no more , since more refugees continue their way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia will communicate with the neighbor@@ ing country Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior Minister and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
following the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people were recorded over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian tel@@ ev@@ ing radio report .
Hungary was sealed at its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which occurred on the same day , will make this extraordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia will allow refugees to pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees from Serbian border to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and cab@@ s in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they have attemp@@ ted to reach a walk on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees cannot be shut down .
for this , the border strips extend to danger : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers now will quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary after the closure of the border little more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 ri@@ ver@@ ted people .
just before gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian Law stages the conqu@@ ering and damage of the border as an off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were instit@@ uted in the Southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted def@@ endants are up to five years and deportation from the land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immig@@ ration authorities , the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filed a total of 94 political asylum applications on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - am the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants 13 families with young children , and two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees were stopped .
however , no one has granted a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe Third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers will be deported back there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers started to do that .
it collected rub@@ b@@ ish on the edge of the road for tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
Lock gr@@ ills were dismant@@ led and the one of the recording bearings was rebuilt in the bound@@ ary .
nobody wanted to express the aim of this change .
Austria will only reach a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
but about the 20,000 migrants are still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was hal@@ ted on orders of German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing groups some smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ sack@@ ed &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were after the bridge on Sunday with the premises , when suddenly ten people with rice off@@ springs stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passau .
because Germany had surprisingly paid off the rail traffic in Austria for the refugee flow , it was so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and went on with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the fron@@ tier into the near Passau .
we first trusted the pri@@ ved guests , with lunch and drink .
we said the same , we bring it to Passau with the car .
&quot; this was for us , of course , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .

the passed train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels by a train to the regional train in the direction of Passau , at the short term , that the rail traffic was stopped after Germany but still trying to try the border .
the regional train station , however , was removed at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein , near the Inn .

Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now calls for more Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , is a logical result of the apparent policy :
instead of helping Y@@ ös@@ z@@ ke detention centre at the erection of structures , Human@@ ity formally recogn@@ ises and publicly conf@@ use the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st circle of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the st@@ icking of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry re@@ viewers must find that this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they are invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , given to the ongoing refugees and the coming winter , for us to produce decent fe@@ eders for safety searches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ .000 winter anch@@ or@@ ages Quar@@ ry
Konrad has fully operational the hands of the refugee .
Christian Conrad is there that his word has weight .
the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to increase district lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got the chaos in the corn@@ erst@@ one centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry said , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; torn situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with an increase of 85@@ .000 covers in the he@@ y year .
in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 should provide the country in 15.000 .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had already talks with the country cap@@ tains .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings , even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supported Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which shall be clari@@ fied how the church will help .
great expectations sets the asylum coordin@@ ator in the ORF @-@ Action as well as we . &quot;
the platform can offer individuals as un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , it is hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of hours , there cannot be that lod@@ gings must have a certain amount of hand @-@ holder or great@@ ness .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency standards should be valid .
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he himself fo@@ unds him with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , which you do not say without further into the face the im@@ parti@@ ality .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Conrad and Mai@@ er will cause the Republic no expense , as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their employees on three to four .
so far , their own lod@@ gings was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is no problems with permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
first , no opening urban sports hall and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as we currently under@@ take the data subject without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further locations are to be tested for emergency .
cr@@ iti@@ que exercise of the chef on the part@@ iti@@ oning of refugees within the federal state .
other areas have to contribute to their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) held a further procedure in the refugee question on Monday .
See@@ hofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the res@@ ume of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remain possible .
however , there is now the respective border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the protection seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger took more stronger solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the advance of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the comprehensive refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz Industrial Region is officially closed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings , the stock exchange IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is aimed at young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New flav@@ our@@ ers , and later on which to be acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the very beginning , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - a few of them promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is conc@@ eded by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
at the same time , 30 percent of the 2700 square meters are already le@@ ased , for a further 40 percent there is requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin made second store in the arcade
vene@@ er is at the heart of the new shop .
however , Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ban Market Ark@@ ade without further ado in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business , in which it sells bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is turned around Dam@@ enh@@ and@@ tas@@ chen of the Vene@@ er brand , all wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
in the past , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I long over@@ lay if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among others , also the Fur@@ la @-@ Produc@@ ers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , were done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only one in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has laid it in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
for me , most if something is developed and I can display new trends with stand@@ able prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , also the nurse may not answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s about getting a nice bag of each outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer An@@ c@@ est@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants called An@@ ders .
this feature also combines some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants us to become the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he comments , journalists touching , or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential s@@ wir@@ led strongly .
and cuts well off .
this will also be registered in the Ar@@ all@@ u@@ sian city , where the grand@@ parents of real estate with billi@@ on@@ aire approach come from .
the New Yor@@ kers with the hair @-@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term for many in the winery on the Wine Route .
some of the 1200 inhabitants is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in a campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about its aim , to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find that exciting , but not so deeply impressed in their diet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , among whom also Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ally opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is just a bit &apos; big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; random is the nick@@ name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - towards High German : the An@@ ders , says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump of success story began in 1885 when the last man went out and opened a restaurant to gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
founding of the property company were the first real estate of land in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy , their wish to return to the home country , failed to the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had the director of the Institute for Experim@@ ental History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explains the film start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ y say@@ ings of the desc@@ endants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and asked the construction of a bound@@ ary wall to put illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ o , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote transformation of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( The Grand@@ ma was a popular Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement has ever seen the Americans rather dist@@ anz@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so big about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the retirement schem@@ es Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned as usual K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came up with a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better , if he won &apos;t forget the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had in the days of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ cr@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , for the Tr@@ ump , has been inter@@ viewed , 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ singers have seen , also in the USA gu@@ arding interest .

seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the efforts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the Today show
&quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son claims to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but it has produced no major shi@@ fts on the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ outs char@@ tered with Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the ri@@ val sunrise , with hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ Days , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts that also belong to Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , because Sunrise aver@@ aged 39@@ 7,000 viewers in the five capit@@ als , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight rise in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today was the gap to Sunrise in the last months .
in August , Today reached on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now , sunrise is available at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 near today .
this is the most interesting thing happens each morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently wid@@ owed father , who settled down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were asked whether Thomson had a hit @-@ show solo without ne@@ b@@ ation of Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and a slight The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may apparently have un@@ wit@@ ated who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood has ended up in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls left will certainly not give up if she is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two will checked , you might be given an indication that he will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds up his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ ric in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and mentioned his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude concerning reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods &apos;s last Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could get corrup@@ ted , who won the Bach@@ el@@ ors &apos; heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on earth at both feet and it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I &apos;ve seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ stay last week you made clear that Wood &quot; can be &quot; One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this obviously is not just a game - I am now tuned to him , &quot; she said .
and when asked , who Wood should choose whom Wood should pick it , because she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests for his impressive open day of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers were ban@@ ished for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a rum@@ ble , as he did a rum@@ by League &apos;s league with his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
rather than grinding of ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula ampli@@ fied Hay@@ ne public in his press conference after the play .
the 49@@ ers Sport repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to get his mis@@ erable catch and take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ on pat@@ ched in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnes@@ ota Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian danger had been hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the play@@ field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that comes now , one just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin debut in 2007 , when a pass was leading up in his own in @-@ go@@ al field at a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters want to demand the employment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the start of the FW @-@ autumn c@@ ens@@ orship in a major crisis on Bay@@ erns schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .

other main topics were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free W@@ eller meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the theme for kinder@@ garten , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger was calling for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it was in the 1990s during the former Yugoslavia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes not further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free W@@ eller boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ gel@@ ding asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ file the free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ w@@ anger also requested more staff for the administrative courts , responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW boss critic@@ ised that several states did not consistently be consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we strug@@ gling nationwide standards of the states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern de@@ vised me , others not . &quot;

at the end of the new school year , Professor Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; Central Stage plus &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ as@@ ium level of three to four years is tested , in the result it will take nine years until the high school .
but that is not far enough Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; the theme of the G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that do .

4 killed , after polic@@ emen were shooting at prot@@ esters in Nepal .
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal when police fired with rubber industries to a crowd forming the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
Bish@@ nu Ra@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , some of them cast stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said that the police was using Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , and then shot up in the air before she res@@ orted to rubber pads .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , and he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rubber industries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known to them that they can kill themselves , but they are usually used as a less deadly alternative , apparently a so high death @-@ rate produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate was the last in weeks violent protest in Nep@@ als Southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces may be educated in the framework of the proposed new constitution .
there were protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ urg@@ ist who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent disputes since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , the country divided into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been controlled by centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working on a new constitution is on the road since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ator agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional system in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could engage in force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for slightly overweight diabet@@ ics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a recent study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly sur@@ passed people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to minim@@ ize the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , O@@ bes@@ ity operations have proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out by people who are ob@@ sc@@ ant ob@@ ese with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they collected since 2007 in a study and compar@@ es two types of obes@@ ity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach tor@@ tu@@ ce - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those who undergo surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
below , the BMI remained with the ones who did not receive surgery for non @-@ surgical treatments at 29 .
among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , completely dissolved in 36 % of the diabetes condition and partially with 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the type of diabetes itself proceeds only by one percent and partly with only about two percent .
Moreover , results in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors &apos; out .
the researchers are super@@ vised the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; Gly@@ ca@@ emic Control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provides average results with the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass project group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased dec@@ lines in the BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) compared to a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery five years , there are references from a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was suffering from ob@@ ese people who under@@ bra@@ vely under@@ gone a obes@@ ity operation , some 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study was not an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously if the patient is with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we wait too long until we bring people serious , this is serious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic modification you have tied her body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is an revers@@ al really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , added that the real solution for the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for violence to end the violence in the hometown of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama &apos;s Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , on the eth@@ ics studies .
he stipul@@ ated that under the circumstances set the interests of humanity to the interests of individual nations or continents .
it also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red at the refugee crisis but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everybody to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Germany &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts were reli@@ eved in tack@@ ling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly by education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and said George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist bombing of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction in the USA drew a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I put my side inserts in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he translated violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase in disinf@@ ection by hanging over disinf@@ ection by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ins control centres in the USA are reporting about almost 400 percent increase in number of children under twelve years , including strong alcoholic disinf@@ ection agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from disinf@@ ection equipment in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins control centres rose , by 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly common in those products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ants were deliber@@ ately drinking , while some of it do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ation in the social media .
show videos on YouTube , such as youth disinf@@ ect@@ ants only drink because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ fat mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger kids can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that it is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and orange juice that are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ ection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ icity especially for small children .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Department of Kansas , University of Kansas , CA stations in S@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have whis@@ ky whis@@ ky to whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way of consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four spra@@ w@@ ling for stra@@ w@@ berry fragran@@ cies in school , was taken to school in an emergency .
your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk by an adult in an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , who treated her in G@@ um , Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency .
doctors super@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ atory Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ Yah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ection enclos@@ ures outside of the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario , after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ection agents , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product contained meth@@ anol requires a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in January , three students of the fourth class were managing the fourth class in New York , their &quot; vul@@ gar reduction of poison , &quot; by taking anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against suspension disinf@@ ection and used them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the dealt plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and proved disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be witness to a hang@@ ings in Oklahoma
somewhat later , except in a late legal intervention , I will look at how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day was near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell all the story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , will find a mak@@ eup lot@@ tery instead of choosing who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is chosen will be watching it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will sit by Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps @-@ tight friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Oklahoma acc@@ use me on Twitter , giving my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that she could have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public@@ ity was going to help the death sentence against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there &apos;s not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from this perspective .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn on for that .
what you will get from me is what it says , a man should die unnecessary death .
man to fire , ch@@ ase , ch@@ ase , coming out from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth , the police , was un@@ successful when he was in the sh@@ allow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house@@ keeping incident in pel@@ vic floor .
when she discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape the C@@ anning River towards them .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got in the water@@ - and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ stable salmon Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about doing his uniform that he turned into a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun to escape to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
dream soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offer an unforgettable example .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to extract him out and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aims at ste@@ wards and the integration of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a racing day treatment , the last straw seat on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went around the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ he@@ dge at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying of sp@@ ying and didn &apos;t want it to see it &quot; as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have eaten a long time , but sometimes they are so fru@@ str@@ ated that all comes out to get out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know they have departed .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home today and sleep well .
I would like to go about the head , and I would like to think my owners are doing my best for them .
if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
earlier , Moo@@ dy had to leave Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , making sure the integration division had tried to spin his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before eighte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart was sitting in a room with a man - whom I will be called , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that &apos;s the case , they certainly should touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed to gras@@ p me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moore , the president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of that and still are today .
should this tell me that it is personal ?
has the Route L compl@@ ished and makes people responsible outside of the train@@ ers what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take away my license and I have no doubt that what I say will be thinking about it now .
but I arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ation levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching conducted that he said he &quot; could throw his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation by the un@@ eliminated Master C@@ avi@@ ar , drawn the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ culous , after having been applied a pack of mud or clay on the run@@ way , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to assume full responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers has been applied to the leg .
it could have been so evening like that .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , whatever was that way .
it was so on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ im@@ on@@ ial dis@@ qualification for treatment using the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who raise these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all want to see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer - Craig Bell@@ amy to fight against ri@@ vals &apos;s claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised cr@@ iti@@ que of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney con@@ vent Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator in the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring &quot; with his team during the high @-@ Storm victory in Sydney will be allowed on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett did a little cover on the Storm team when his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tor@@ ch of his team and said that she only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tor@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach on his team is confident that they are worried that they are worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ combat as she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les for a real focus . this is the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore likely to not get used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange , as this always shows up at this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and rec@@ alls his ment@@ or that viol@@ inist St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons , the Premier League in 2010 , with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George became a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and what we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play as they play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strengthen confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roo@@ ster play a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos to Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a bit of tension ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention , it means we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend off because they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the finale at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with 200.000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ cl@@ age
a man , possibly threat@@ ening a lifetime punishment because of his attempt to take possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine due to Queens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the Bundes@@ police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina and later in the Café co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong punishment for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the Café itself could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of the assass@@ ination of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the trial , he lied the police above his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ zeb@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of these two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , he warned not .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ ated his Australian and his Serbian pass , while the police reports on a daily basis and turned to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ onder@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ ophil@@ es used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ constant images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches which used terms for searching for in@@ constant images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed to the officials that he would have done it , because it was leading to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Educ@@ ator@@ oph@@ ile to the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor in E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sheri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he gave the search for the computer from him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten trou@@ bles .
he was asked for his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked to send more pictures .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he will see images of ra@@ pe and mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then also saw the un@@ ceas@@ ing images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused computers and play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , declared himself guilty of the indictment , in@@ constant images of children on 14 June last year , decided to have exp@@ ired against the editions and did not appear before the court to be appearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not under the Register of sexual off@@ ences , since one can ar@@ gue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be found in his failure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sheri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael went away from the judgment to October to maintain background reports about social labour .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit , but was kept in pre@@ ventive detention for hear@@ ings to other cases .
it was included in the date of the judgment in the register of sexual off@@ ences .
tow@@ age to small border cros@@ sings to Germany
more refugees away from large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad houses made from fear of discovery and capture people increased in smaller border trans@@ itions
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the mar@@ g@@ inal flow of Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot about bridges and we@@ bs to get to the German side .
there they are taken from the police agencies and re@@ directed to the registration .
at the Munich central station in Munich , more refugees came again to Germany when compared to the weekend in Wednesday .
at 8.00 a.m. , around 700 people have arrived in the capital city , said a speaker on the morning .

on Friday , the sun again can be seen .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturer show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
above all , 2015 is particularly affected by the compact cars that are currently being used particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new regist@@ rations accounted for at this segment alone in August alone .
that is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , numerous new compact models will be presented between all of the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the major premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
this makes the volume model also well sold , the new Astra has to become much more expensive as well .
Opel presents an entry below the VW Golf in prosp@@ ect , which starts at around € 17 650 .
the current Astra costs Euro 16 990 .
the Astra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only five fifth .
in spring of the Com@@ bi , a second variant will be followed , as well as seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in front of the new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is running the fourth generation of its Astra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a fifth tool in a conventional and an emphas@@ ised sporty GT version .
in the trade , it comes from the beginning of next year , then a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan supp@@ orter wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated in the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which will make its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
depending on the manufacturer data , maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eon in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact laser model DS 4 which is to be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were laid at the front end : here the radiator gr@@ ille was drawn new and the controlled head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in a compact class , the IAA is a range of revised and new variants , such as the sc@@ anned Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are decent
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court ( Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht ) has set up an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in which months in a small cell was accommod@@ ated .
because of injury to human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees have generally accepted financial compensation , if they are in too small cells .
this decision has been made published by the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a Decision on Wednesday .
the suff@@ er@@ ers can even hope to pay the judges even if they were closed only a few days in the closed rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who has meanwhile been on an open foot , was transferred to a larger cell in his fo@@ rested site .
his liability Clau@@ se due to the un@@ worthy adhes@@ ion of life against the Land Berlin failed .
however the judges lifted up the ruling of the Berlin @-@ ammerg@@ au aid and refer@@ enced the case to ren@@ ew this .
they see the human being hurt by man .
ammerg@@ au advis@@ es now at the amount of compensation
even if made from legal reasons from the frag@@ ile period only a few days detention for the compensation , be a gender statement , it was called it .
otherwise , the privacy of the personality of the personality is to be fear . &quot;
the ammerg@@ au must now clari@@ fy the amount of dent@@ ition .
the constitu@@ tion@@ aries had often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they just said in April of a prisoner &apos;s dem@@ nity , because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell .
according to human n@@ un@@ worthy , the 2011 decision also includes the multiple allocation of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which led to an in@@ mate in November 2009 , confirmed a decent accommodation .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had taken place every day for three months from 15 to 21 hours in a like cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks .
prisoners are therefore again included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ sively , even to drow@@ ns it should have occurred because of its cl@@ amped situation .
after the appointment of the judi@@ cial agency , 21 digits in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the young Dutch lack , 19 will be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs that year , according to the statement of Deputy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany are giving the following overview .
it is needed according to different forecasts from 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the pest@@ icide @-@ institute ) and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically , the lack of living room , but above all in affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly advant@@ ageous flats .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ icide institute : 80 &quot; 000 social apartments each year would have to develop and this would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of € 6.4 billion per year .
unanim@@ ously , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for residential construction in residential construction .
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , at the long term , 55 percent of the poultry farmers in Germany could be advant@@ ageous .
however , the refugees in Germany would not even be question@@ ed system@@ atically after their qualification to help them crit@@ ici@@ ously critic@@ ized Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education at Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ ust@@ master there has been a political turning point in Germany : from work to refugees to recognition of work .
while there was an employment ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ying light , the asylum seek@@ ers was limited to one residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society itself - also because of the specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seas@@ oning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - multiply the view that refugees should be rapid over access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
so far there has been no adequate supply of general and vocational training courses .
studies show that jobs will most commonly be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is , therefore , under the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt from the Königs@@ er to labor integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School Council confirmed that only a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave their children to the put@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is only important to meet the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to convince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration fee distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly rise by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase their training capacities - roughly by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge in welcome classes in the classes .
they are not always taught by educated teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ itch from Berlin School Administration .
the German student of students is estimated to study about 20 percent of refugees in Germany .
in principle , the German asylum seek@@ ers is prohibited to asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Wi@@ en@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now has given up his attitude .
Studi@@ illi@@ es refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because Refu@@ ge@@ es with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce will not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er law , when they begin studying .
the latter basically gets no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they are not falling under the circle of banned persons .
Ged@@ ser@@ f Refu@@ ge@@ es had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demanded Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German student union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will soon play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely mut@@ ated the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association would also be important to take care of new arri@@ vals .
rights to the rights include obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representative of Islam must un@@ ite and be ready to work together with the state in many fields and give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the read@@ iness to counter@@ charge anti @-@ religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ mig@@ rate such conflicts in Germany now have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed comp@@ iling the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a subject of society in the future .
in doing so , the majority society will also change , the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ings show , the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what migrants are seeking for a long time and for what international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism in Germany must become reality in the coming years , needs to be peaceful and use their new citizens - for the good of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , Germany is capable of providing medic@@ inal workers so far , says doctors President Frank Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we can do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money will flow into the system .
to prevent narrow passes , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery tells you to emig@@ rate to all the families like the Registration of Health .
the services would later be calculated with the federal states .
in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people submit to the limited power of the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors are on creating the language barri@@ ers especially .
previously so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es would have been taken into interpre@@ ting cost , demanding them .
also , many refugees have been assisted in emergency ambul@@ ances for many other flights .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugees , there are much more un@@ treated disability , and among the young people go about HIV inform@@ ing .
but with the partially different clinical pictures , German doctors told her apprentic@@ eship but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery thinks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite be@@ fall or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the nu@@ ance of trouble is due to the refugees even in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees have even been doctors .
to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to prove their qualification and may need more tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal Employment Agency ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are especially vulner@@ able .
a recent study of TU München showed that every fifth Syrian refugee tragedy is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
whoever is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath@@ s , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac death and death anxi@@ eties .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration in@@ som@@ nia , severe terror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ically sick refugees gain a reduction .
although psych@@ ically dise@@ ased asylum seek@@ ers can request an application for a psycho@@ therapy , however , editing phase lasts several months .
in addition , non @-@ workers and doctors , who are not trained for mental ill@@ nesses , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this lead frequently to mis@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes us back on the traditions of Circus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst inv@@ ade in the Man@@ ege on the bricks of Fre@@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ art@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this motto reflects the current management of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for inspiration is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to bring people away from their everyday life and take it for two hours to take refuge in a totally different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; almond cocktail with world town @-@ fl@@ air , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept .
now 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the programme of the cir@@ cus convinces by talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family with@@ draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their handi@@ craft .
with the heroes of the silent film , there will be able to loose the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - identify with these words .
their hum@@ orous art at the mast should conquer female &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from a number of salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Maxim@@ al also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and sophist@@ ic@@ ation .
to balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake is intri@@ gu@@ ing and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing conditions in the attitude of zir@@ cons are not too frequently subject matter on different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , neither does it go well with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string of matches .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , is read by the possibility of each desire from the eyes .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the ring .
so the first commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ ra @-@ jum@@ bo , a mix of a sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst are proud .
the two animals lived eight years in a flock and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst wrote .
although the roid is still not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor , something is likely to be there .
&quot; one is sure , &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 o &apos;clock .
Sunday starts the program at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , every day , the zoo is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe today presents false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , desc@@ ended up the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by representatives of the opposition that they would have received anonymous sales thre@@ ats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had suffered him and interrupted him on the position of the Nation &apos;s State in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es they warned them warning , Mr. Mu@@ gabe speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters after Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament also issues that the unity of unity ends in the parliament , and as soon as the Parliament leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build up to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will share in two publicly listed companies and connecting the computer and printer business from his fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures ensure a competitive cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which is to guide the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is more smaller than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better installed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on delivering integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s , to manufacture electrical installations and the Palo Alto garage is called the birth place of the Silicon Valley .
HP has done a massive restructuring to tackle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused company will yield better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates at the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb will have to stand behind the final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation remain after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had severely damaged the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury and had returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not ignore the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
it is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from pure medical perspective , but like Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops an un@@ comfortable pattern .
Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ i@@ als 157 b@@ oul@@ os in the last five times .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability of the last season is ongoing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from injury , you have a vulner@@ able time to strengthen your body and fight mar@@ tial forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do and will pass through a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal starts in the Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Bay on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur at the upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey traveled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also start Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to maintain the balance and the players that require it to treat a small break @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favourites are to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing areas with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night and was measured at Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal moved from the past season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ distant hopes to lead the association to its first European political triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that has given us serious lessons of co@@ eli@@ mit
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to the need for men to open oneself , now even more desper@@ ate than ever , how self @-@ suicide prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than for women .
in the efforts to tackle the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ ev@@ ines ( CA@@ LM - campaign oppos@@ ing a mis@@ erable life ) in 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men there@@ with to seek assistance if they need these .
friendship is the heart of heart in the fight to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms felt that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery have doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication on social media , communication with its focus on substance is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have doubled the need to appear li@@ vi@@ dly and to appear , even if the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire told recently , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality that sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in a cosy arm@@ chair and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can rely on any case , even if they are often going to explo@@ it completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telephone call me , I declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us , often feel not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you face any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term ventilation mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s co@@ ats .
as much my objective out@@ sider site about the phone the people in moments of desp@@ air may also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day totally re@@ designed back@@ drop , so why don &apos;t you accept your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might be .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his departure against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria meets PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held this course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain put his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the centre of Liberty on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champion League Deb@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master at his way , but after that they passed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani raised a head coach in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they stri@@ ves not only quali@@ fications for the kno@@ bs in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics got adapted chances in front of the gate . he was later joined in the game against his home town team and against the club , which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to create 2 : 0 , our opponents have problems to create and relaxed back , even if there are certain things we need to have perf@@ ected in the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his bre@@ ach in one of three changes in the Paris Team , that was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was p@@ aired by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing@@ man became known as the man , who was able to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence behind which he completed by Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö achieved the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level with nine national players on the field , and was le@@ ased with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the field .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who submitted to Kevin Tra@@ der P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself appeared , with some patches and bad nuts , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who had not been left alone in the first half alone , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
however , he stopped many more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which was transformed into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate was finally reached after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . he made up his sixth part of the season after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had f@@ ished one left flan@@ ks of Max@@ well .
that ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to maintain the end results , before replacement E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi saw a goal in the end .
the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not range out . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game from them !

&quot; P@@ EP said to me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; to get it pun@@ ches me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would have walked with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the grass , when the Red Army switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) , and at the end , the Triumph was celebrated .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in movies
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted African filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this was the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ized in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaranteed Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown under@@ went sho@@ cking , with ins@@ ulting dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments of actors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Mar@@ ti@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production @-@ cent@@ ric bin affair and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to think about people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to handle the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white feed .
the producer of Dear White People put himself up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting right @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want to . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded on the dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip using &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - this is SO LI@@ VE that it does so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 vi@@ ets and 4,000 lique@@ urs since its publication .
note : Dam@@ ons comments are at a time , at the exact phr@@ ase representation in media at the helm of social discussion .
after teenage pregnancy , Michael Brown had been killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves was registered nation@@ alist and authorities to discrimin@@ ate discrimination against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made a start to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quietly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
more recently , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter made a statement published and in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders say .
recently , she was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that invited to visit the Pope to discuss concerning the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or made the Pope , it is un@@ clear .
American Ninja Warrior &apos;s first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the seasonal final two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten succeeded in final .
the final task belonged to climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period , with which he finished the first Ath@@ let phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for a full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about this , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 , or had my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his b@@ unch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer of Kent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he stopped the course at all , not just won the prize money .
following the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; when there are more than one fin@@ alists , there is one of the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he won &apos;t talk about anything about it .
he is just as happy having done what he did .
masses of awards received him from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac had just felt exactly when they had tran@@ scri@@ bed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for one season , the fil@@ ming will start in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps to Minnes@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger &apos;s on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler . however , this part played perfectly against Minnes@@ ota &apos;s Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the Twin@@ s applied a chance to climb to the end of Houston Ast@@ ros , for the second American League of Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which had been so difficult to gras@@ p a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories do fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad A@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher , Alfredo Simon held his early offensive assist@@ ing when you scored three times in the first two inside , then in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) stayed 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bul@@ l@@ pen and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had been hit four hits against the Seattle nav@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sh@@ ined the bu@@ zz well , &quot; she said .
he looked good at ( impact training ) , looked much better from the bul@@ l@@ ak@@ pen , and it brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh month , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished that inning with a double on the left hand line .
right F@@ iel@@ ck Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zer to Stri@@ ke@@ k before he replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy &apos;s left @-@ hand .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano who takes a Two @-@ Run entr@@ ust of the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor ou@@ ache to a double play .
it was the major league leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a double play .
after Detroit in the end of the ninth rush an Insurance @-@ Run added , the wall managed to get a R@@ BI @-@ double against the ti@@ reless of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed ap@@ ach con@@ ach at three pit@@ ches for his fifth day .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside strings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been scra@@ pped in front of the game from the vulner@@ able list , after spending a month more than a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt glad when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches on the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the first Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter there was a single piece of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &apos; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the race track in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os , with a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger was assigned in the second , a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ manager , Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not sit well , but he caught the right job .
Hughes was based in a P@@ itch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rec@@ ie@@ ver of the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer .
at Hughes there came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was eliminated because of an injury of the cured me@@ ats .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who executed the San@@ chez &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the injury list , is to be activated for starting on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is scra@@ pped by the vulner@@ abilities to start the Twin@@ s .

hundreds of refugees to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
in case of course , the people in Wiesbaden will be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodations such as the city of Wiesbaden , where he shared on Tuesday evening .
it calcul@@ ates the refugees with 450 to 750 .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ ische Capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
there cannot be temporary space for up to 1000 refugees .
they are then to be spread on other municip@@ alities .
in the past ten days alone , according to information given by the responsible governmental forces , G@@ ießen took 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
even Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters for the great number of refugees in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria .
&quot; I believe that I am not able to think about military action options without Germany , &quot; he said .
he threw the European states &quot; collective way@@ marks . &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup was passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict broke down in front of our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
Germany also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders in Germany .
the Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner sign@@ posted on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV stations ORF , and now nobody will return .
also Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on question of an agreement , in which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , has already given talks between the Director @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures were not calling them and rejected discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came through the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and their Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann asked for a special summit meeting with several other EU leaders for the next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet come to a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt to connect another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee in Germany , the Bund wants to support countries in the original and distribution of men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wa@@ ist@@ band will work together with the Länder , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations by the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel under@@ ed Merkel , those people who ro@@ bs shelter , do this too .
but who didn &apos;t find heads , he could also not stay in Germany .
this view was strongly dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge strength &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers border to Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border with Romania over a fence .
this neighbor@@ ing country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat crossing over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had s@@ nat@@ ched the fence .
in Turkey , so for e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of immigrants contribute to the Greek border .

these are researchers from observ@@ ations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;

this exchange movement is small , but still too big for a solid poster of heaven , it means in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) on Tuesday .
the researchers set their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade paper .
being longer known was that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .

at least on the South Pole , there was a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers formed it at that time .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks . &quot;
&quot; that makes us hard , Rama is a very loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with a view of the possible commitment of a wider professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruits - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but who wants to take care of his sl@@ ender line , he is often not recommended by them .
for Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - mainly suc@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them are B vitamins and vitamins E and C. The above all contain man@@ gan@@ os but much Vitamin A and its pre@@ press beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports t@@ end@@ our , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
at purchasing , man@@ gos should not be too soft or firm and pleasant smell .
the form@@ work colour alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure relaxing or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go but also heart@@ y courts are a special touch .
it sm@@ ooth@@ es the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

first face tower , then trademark cold fron@@ ts
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as met@@ e@@ o@@ acade@@ mies appeared on Tuesday .
on Wedn@@ esdays and in the night of Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blow some of the caves of the hair of the F@@ öh@@ n .
according to F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold fron@@ ts that yields strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts , and a temperature back .
such as Met@@ e@@ o@@ news writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive pressure @-@ area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western end .
on the night@@ club breaks through the valleys at night in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n saw until Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ ner with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , inter@@ ned and especially in the Ur@@ g@@ land sometimes also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent emergency , and even hur@@ ri@@ ches up to over 120 km / h can be reached on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday amp@@ er F@@ öh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the hy@@ dr@@ ation starts to st@@ ow away from the Alp@@ ens@@ lav@@ abo .
here it is the rain that keeps you until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps , some 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be paid in the next 48 hours , after having fallen steadily over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n starts to blow out the air , in which a cold fron@@ tend rolls with strong , partly am@@ per@@ y rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ ed strongly until turbul@@ ent , and temperatures go clearly back .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
in Rome almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of the President of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened on Wednesday a previously named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill in the name of the German Re@@ formed .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an for the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name of the nom@@ ic@@ ature was filed in Rome by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries than minority .
in a symbolic way , it is visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) met at Rome as a young August@@ inian Monastery and at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he received the city as a nar@@ rowing sin @-@ fork .
its negative impressions might be strengthened by hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then led the split from the apost@@ olic church with his thes@@ es against the las@@ civi@@ lization .
hammer Artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the g@@ ild@@ ed ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the principal buildings that the Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who has now been published with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical histor@@ ies on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but what is by no means &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adjusted the respective topics , this can quite a bit glo@@ omy .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked at his bi@@ ble project for which it has met a sub@@ jective artistic choice from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of All books . &quot;
these are cycles which are devoted to themes such as cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ ly .
he thus focused on several partners , which is true for Luther @-@ Verlag , with its the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and since especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is referring to the basis of painting with the Bible locations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible sources and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transl@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into current cont@@ ex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts Painting .
nest@@ led among the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and each a set of the artist , here expressed his very personal thought to the respective situation .
the jewel@@ s band has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
however , emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant religious order .
&quot; this was done by the tube , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; I have tried to establish that , perhaps to rep@@ ay me again with the Lord father . &quot;
his second concern was to help vulner@@ ability the art in a fast time : &quot; the perception of pictures is affected today by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed there .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
images always have some mystery , and are not decorative .
&quot; I am a dinosau@@ r in this respect . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer release into the pictures , &quot; they let it affect , detect and feel what power they have : &quot; the image will be for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost comm@@ ended on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old did not notice the Bible to be fully recorded , but most important for him , but mysterious subjects .
&quot; that was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text simply explains . &quot; there was a pictures of the Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life too deep and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak both the language of love as well as responsibility for M@@ öh@@ ler ( biblical ) language .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
construction of the BM@@ X railway crossing

so hill , up , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
I will go out in October , the First Municipal Committee of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to report in the Children and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year has happened any more points , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without any &quot; commem@@ oration &quot; when working with the former indoor swimming pool .

the DF@@ B expands its commitment to the 2019 @-@ 2019 refugees and the Bundesliga starts a clear mark on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in addressing the coming problems .
&quot; I have been making it the biggest challenge for our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there cannot be no one in principle that &apos;s nothing that believes in me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be every individual interested in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet the female Minister of Ö@@ ko@@ vić and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ball could and will help .
however , the decisive turn@@ outs must provide policies .
the German Football League thus has expanded its refugee concept &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal challenges also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ities set out a clear sign if they are going to carry on the left tri@@ k@@ ot@@ er@@ mel instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that all will help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ en Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama brings everyone , no one can see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer fields , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly suffered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager , Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Director Peter Ho@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European championships against Hungary on Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license conditions have started in their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest refin@@ es are involved .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football .
&quot; that is of enormous meaning , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly serve 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B @-@ S@@ election and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
report : ex @-@ Chairman loses an eye in accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye for several reports , according to a overthrow in the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house he was fallen to a water glass after midnight , that he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , and then turned out to the road - he has told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Chairman of the Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year @-@ old manager was with the meeting and is fully busy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to expand the software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to rise again when you are fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : den@@ ense at the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us will be final in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundesliga top of Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ en , the Bv@@ E @-@ Coach is open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high loading of its pros Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position at the re@@ us position .
thus , he announced a change on the door@@ way .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller accepts the place of sacred novel by Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher gave the world champion .
whether the den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europa League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el leaves it open .
with a high probability he will also deny the second game .
the for@@ ged statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the final examination for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League has its goal to re@@ sign up mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ sign@@ able : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to pick the title . &quot;
robot cars : government plans to lead the leadership
according to the will of the Federal Government in Germany , the Federal Government will be on change in automotive technology .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to open a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which will be presenting investments in the expanding digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Show IAA for a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
automated and net@@ worked driving will increase road safety and disp@@ ose of less stress , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also aims to discuss the topic with its counter@@ parts from the G7 states , which will also come together with representatives from the industry .
the strategy paper of the traffic programme emphas@@ izes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a generous donation to digital radi@@ os .
testing new technology is currently based on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government will examine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how Germany wants to use it international to be the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , the federal government is willing to set up an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention which so far only sees people as driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
driving driving , the car will increase the lead , the driver will increase more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process data in seconds .
after a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 is technically possible .
still driving vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected close to 2020 . &quot;
added value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors concluded by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more security and efficiency on road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic critic S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability for accidents and the security of personal data of the drivers should be clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA study shows that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous cars are expected to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years with it , 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 with autonomous cars , were 33 percent in the US .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
following a survey of the UK &apos;s Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to de@@ pri@@ ve control during the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent in traffic could be present on the free@@ way , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good every V@@ ated would leave the control under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to take the title without Timo Scheider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ head Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM teaching process in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a blend of all big fashion shows and a wa@@ x@@ book Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look rather human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was quite easy , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , that is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung &quot; has changed his first negative attitude towards a show above his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been here , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition had a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , you arrive at the Museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it goes about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the almost @-@ looking works of the man , which wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it &apos;s an super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed complete art work that has been operated much effort : to fr@@ ze the puppets , was made for example a styl@@ ist .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers age t@@ eddy also is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ matic mo@@ dic foot@@ steps of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly dressed in football ) he put up his t@@ eddy B@@ HS and clothes , she said . Gaul@@ tier .

jewellery instead of Gard@@ iner - Pl@@ au@@ er tip as Fashion @-@ N@@ ical
in the past I went to the long embro@@ idery shop in and around Pl@@ auen about the meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered nutrients and tips emerged in large quantity for customers who worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
today , this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the E@@ quest@@ rian treas@@ urer .
instead the fashion is important again .
at the beginning of the pl@@ um tip , fashion played a major role , then was driven by home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , bor@@ rowed from the sty@@ list@@ ic sty@@ list@@ ic periods , an increasing fire potential .
who is no longer operating in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they already account for half of all jobs .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ gol@@ fing Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association pl@@ um and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 percent of the turnover is broken .
private , retail and wholesale , are almost no more wholesale .
our products can hardly reach our customers in this way .
the mass production today is much cheaper in the Asian region , and sells almost exclusively about chains .
furthermore , export of export , current to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce organic and soci@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
on the University of Applied Sciences , U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au , the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to counter the competition out of Asian space , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies who need to think especially economically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design often varies just slightly to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago Ver@@ ild@@ es@@ ign@@ erin Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic snow@@ mobile tops .
the machine is embro@@ i@@ dered on some places small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ au@@ ding gold swe@@ dish Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired to insp@@ ire him : &quot; before that I could do nothing with a traditional plat@@ former . &quot;
now she uses the tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process the pattern has shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ts &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors were living in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of pl@@ au@@ der lace .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broad for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to be wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how to improve business leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16 session of the Central Administ@@ rative Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new spin @-@ ups and encourage reforms , bring new momentum and vit@@ ality to give new economic growth , X@@ i said .
the guide group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativ@@ es@@ list for the regulation of the market access , relaxation of the border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants account system .
after statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not involved in investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of meaning as it has a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring an illegal business field and the market is more open , statement is statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ensure controls over the powers deleg@@ ated to the companies and ensure that companies will decide how they perform their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will permit borders , exploring new models of border @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer , controlled sectors open sectors , other areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permit with the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right to guarantee lawyers to work their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a session .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also took part in meeting at the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mercury limit in cat@@ fish species
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large cat@@ fish and an significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organisation , which is an according paper company of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects mis@@ led by force of pregnant and infants , Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is designed to reduce the limit values of the nerve cycle , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury , depending on the fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large smokers should be severely affected by mercury even today , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the length must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ usable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU intends to limit the limit values for other fish at present 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch called this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually weighs as low as they are the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ sen@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de di@@ stra@@ ction man@@ eu@@ ver who helps only the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal human being heavily poll@@ uted for people of high @-@ toxic heavy metal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low amounts due to un@@ born damage to the nervous system could cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on its homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry announced that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets above all through coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Culture , the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture gathered more than six tons of mercury in year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings found in fish has already become the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
