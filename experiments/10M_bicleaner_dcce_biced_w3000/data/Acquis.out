( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties are expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cs , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution with a er@@ y@@ thro@@ yte im@@ pregn@@ ation .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mix within a series , when a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood type determination are available ( at the moment anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be found on the basis of the title of unknown re@@ productions in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sh@@ ears contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are free of charge from the International Labor@@ atorium for biological nor@@ ms of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ements Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparative changes in the Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , the characteristics should remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iration date of a reag@@ ent shape according to labels is maximum one year after the last satisfactory host test .
the exp@@ ul@@ atory date for dry re@@ alities results in accordance with the results of the support attempts ; it is appro@@ ve by state regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ im@@ ents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in which it has been dried and the so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry re@@ actor may lose maximum 0,5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ox@@ idi@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solvents supplied ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibio@@ tic drug to compl@@ ain the requirements of speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin of blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved serum .
reag@@ ents , equivalent to whether in flu@@ ent form or after re@@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain se@@ di@@ ments or visible particles .
for the international exchange of specific reag@@ ents for blood group@@ ing determination , as long as long as long as long as a International Convention on a Single System has come .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are distributed in such ways and in such amounts , not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity must be in a container must be so large that the content may be used to conduct the effectiveness described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has over all production stages and insp@@ ections of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all given reag@@ ents are to store so long from laboratory at@@ orio until with a few probability that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant @-@ plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective measures to rein@@ forcement the effectiveness and preser@@ ving the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to their effective proportion .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black @-@ and @-@ white printed label , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the crowd or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid used liquid ,
in addition , this label or label is provided on the box where the individual container must be included , or the instructions attached added to the manual : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the crowd or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid used liquid ,
each sending is a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is gained from the blood of selected people of the group B , which can be immun@@ ized by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , i.e. those of the group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human red blood cells containing no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard character@@ ization of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparative study separated against sw@@ inging from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml .
an anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object panel with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ % up@@ swing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is applied with the re @-@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard character@@ isation of the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard pre@@ disp@@ osition of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected people of the group A , which can be immun@@ ized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B immun@@ otherapy .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard character@@ ization of the anti @-@ B blood group or to type a corresponding compar@@ ation of B @-@ blood cells .
the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object bear@@ er with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur within the double time , however , if the same attempt to un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard type of blood @-@ group@@ ing or with a standard pre@@ disp@@ osition of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is gained from the blood of selected people of the group 0 , which can be immun@@ ized by red blood cells or specific substances of the group A and group B immun@@ otherapy .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. ones of group A including sub @-@ groups A1 and A2 ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells contain no Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) an@@ tigen ( which are non @-@ glut@@ inated in general by anti @-@ A serum of blood don@@ keys ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard type of blood @-@ group@@ ing or a corresponding comparative study , separated against sw@@ inging from A1 to A2 blood cells .
in addition , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard type of blood @-@ group@@ ing or a corresponding comparative study against a sw@@ inging from B blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a easily identi@@ fi@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) was mixed on an object bear@@ er with the same amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent sw@@ inging from A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed with the same time , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard character@@ isation of the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard prepar@@ ative activity .
the anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) mix serum for an object carriers with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed within the double time , but must be performed un@@ dil@@ uted international standard type of blood @-@ group@@ ing or standard pre@@ disp@@ ensing of same Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object bear@@ er with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination may occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each speci@@ fic@@ ity can be one of two types which distinguish themselves through the conditions , among which a ag@@ glut@@ ination becomes hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
with others , which are referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination may only be achieved with the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids , such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other applications .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on objects are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are aw@@ ed in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h @-@ Group may possibly alter when International standard prepar@@ ates are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood group infections ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from blood one or several persons , which are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not included with human red blood cells that does not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ tre of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard character@@ ization of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react after the possibility of blood cells , the do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a which are intended for use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , having to mixed a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination at about 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ um is obtained from blood one or several persons , which immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not included with human red blood cells that does not contain the C @-@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , only specifically if the tested blood cells are absorbed into a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on sheets according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) , must be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is obtained from blood one or several persons , which are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ tre of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use in sheets according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , must be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of c@@ c@@ dd@@ l blood cells , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera from the Speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the Speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective in relation to the manufacturers specified by the manufacturer .
is an serum for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time of all types of red blood cells that demonstrate a reaction , no less than with the ant@@ agon@@ ists .
anti @-@ A serum is gained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ized by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
