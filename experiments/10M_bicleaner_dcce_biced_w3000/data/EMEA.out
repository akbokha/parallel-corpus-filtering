it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets , which dis@@ solve in mouth ) as a solution for inclusion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and spre@@ adsheets , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ str@@ ust and imag@@ inations ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a psych@@ ic illness associated with the patients of man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( perio@@ dic tower ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and for prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased uncertain@@ ty or behavi@@ oral distur@@ b@@ ance when oral medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used to insert or processed the melting tablets in patients who prepare the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
for patients who use other medicines , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of neur@@ ons .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably known primarily as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine to sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role , wearing Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ical symptoms and rest@@ art@@ ing it .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , re @-@ initi@@ ating symptoms , has been investigated in three studies over a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that were stabili@@ zed at 160 patients , where the man@@ ical symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , alter@@ ing symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who studied on treatment .
in addition , the company also conducted studies in order to investigate the melting of the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion ( decre@@ ases ) .
in both studies using the injection solution patients , A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy , in four of five short @-@ term studies , man@@ ic symptoms effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks as placebo the re@@ inst@@ ances of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy @-@ inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , v@@ mor ( continuous movement ) , di@@ lution , nau@@ sea ( di@@ lution ) , ti@@ red@@ ness , ex@@ haus@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and ex@@ haus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , In@@ som@@ nie ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and medium @-@ heavy epis@@ odes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared with risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased uncertain@@ ty and patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral treatment is not suitable for risks associated with risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - Dis@@ order and for prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors jus@@ tify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to the psycho@@ tic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused an increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disorders ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ allergi@@ es , treatment with blood pressure det@@ erg@@ ents ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occasion@@ al reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
when using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ism should occur , should reduce the dose or canc@@ eling the treatment .
if a patient under@@ stands signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ ammed cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at random cases , which may be treated with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response of un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases , extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active substances , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events involving AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is observed as a side effect , or lead to serious complications , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution must be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs like se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
when CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma center of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should benefit the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ers , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ sier before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant while treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to in@@ sufficient data protection for human beings , and due to the in@@ productive studies in the animal , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy , unless the possible benefits jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , like other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they &apos;re safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequencies specified below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes with bi@@ polar disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % was used in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was used in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was used for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in addition to the side effects that may occur in connection with a anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ as@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cr@@ amp circles , un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ately acute over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ aly@@ sis in treatment is an over@@ dose of benefit from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a high plasma scra@@ p .
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder occurs on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - receptor recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 4- , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ees and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ y.@@ Emis@@ sions Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ able decre@@ asing of binding 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the patients who remained a response to study medi@@ ation in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ sk@@ al , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ tion rates shown , showed a significantly stronger improvement when Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and the primary study target &apos; weight gain , stood under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of out@@ stand@@ able patients ) of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to placebo no superior efficacy .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a shift effect compared with placebo or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in week 12 had a comparable share of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie to as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ tra symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabilization phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in preventing the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return into Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ fusion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al duration is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients were not sexually dependent effects .
a popularity analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison with young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the influence of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to withdraw from the metab@@ olic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety immun@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated treatment , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , m@@ yc@@ otox@@ ins and kan@@ ec@@ tic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects include a dos@@ si@@ re @-@ dependent side rin@@ d rin@@ d @-@ tox@@ icity ( CR@@ C ) at 20 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10@@ mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 10 mg / kg / day ) during female ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ eli@@ asis was found as a result of the discharge of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys according to repeated oral treatment of 25 @-@ 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate concentrations were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate concentrations , which were found in the study about 39 weeks in the G@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
during rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for prevention of re@@ juven@@ ating man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy must be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that one year or less continued , there were occasion@@ al reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole rec@@ ap@@ ing dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases , extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active substances , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events involving AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes with bi@@ polar disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder occurs on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - receptor recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and the primary study target &apos; weight gain , stood under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of out@@ stand@@ able patients ) of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to placebo no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with a 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a Chol@@ eli@@ eli@@ ac was found as a result of the discharge of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys according to repeated oral treatment of 25 @-@ 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
during rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid inspection of oc@@ top@@ ical and disease distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral treatment is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started using the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a inj@@ ections in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under re@@ trac@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be used depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the use of the Medic@@ ines or ak@@ ut @-@ Therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tray or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inclusion .
there are no investigations about the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection @-@ solution in patients with a@@ angi@@ ect@@ edness and behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces , which were caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ ac@@ ons in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed with severe se@@ dation or blood pressure if ( see Section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not prescribed for patients with alcohol or drug in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( caused by the or illegal drug ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disorders ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ allergi@@ es , treatment with blood pressure det@@ erg@@ ents ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that one year or less continued , there were occasion@@ al reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole rec@@ ap@@ ing dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , musc@@ ular boo@@ sting , varying levels of consciousness , and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die , per@@ spiration and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is observed as a side effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the following age of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study carried out in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ painted in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist is Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . however , this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabolism , the common application can be combined with high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma center of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ers , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ sier before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
at 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular , the intensity of the Sed@@ an increased significantly compared with the following age of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :

107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was used in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was used for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statistically significantly larger improvements of as@@ cul@@ ti@@ bility / ver@@ teb@@ rates and was similar to placebo and similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant performance improvement in symptoms of symptoms and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value at P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ l. component was 5.8 to placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe A@@ gi@@ v@@ ents , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient level .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the response was similar to study medi@@ ation in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depres@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement when Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of the decline in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and the primary study target &apos; weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of out@@ stand@@ able patients ) at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks in placebo with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ tra symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week course extension , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a re@@ mission while maintaining a bi@@ polar return , predominantly at preventing the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma bri@@ cks are applied for 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target system after repeated treatment in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular lagen .
in studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns according to mat@@ ern@@ ally exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) was about the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three @-@ quarters had received an anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in all cases or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug containing medicines ( given in combination with other pharmaceuticals to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional pel@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine received .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines and survival .
however , patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer resulted in terms of these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have silent or before the start of treatment low neutr@@ rop@@ ants in the blood .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained no more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine , and that in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing drugs do not have to be given to other medicines , to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the marketing of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ ral number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sens@@ ory Neurop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
sens@@ ory Neurop@@ athy degree 3 is to break the treatment until an improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies involving patients with affected kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data on recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the application with children under 18 years of age not adequate data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .

it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in has been medi@@ ated in the Trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of Plas@@ mak@@ oma in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in &apos;s transportation by P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is supported by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umen SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ re@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tum@@ our .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparison study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane that was given in the form of in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ali@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
in previously , 14 % of patients had no chemotherapy alone , 27 % had adj@@ uv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ ases and adj@@ uv@@ ant treatment .

the effect of active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ plas@@ mak@@ ere@@ al increased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or consec@@ ration bond of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced sound tum@@ ours , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 17@@ mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ aring of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver microphones and tissues , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported to metab@@ oli@@ zed - hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average total dose for cum@@ ulative alcohol was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to organic pharmaceuticals , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference guide &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cells that may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications if the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml are expected .
treatment with se@@ per@@ amed must be directed under the supervision of a doctor , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make self @-@ ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be done by the patient or car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver or car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver , provided an appropriate manual .
in patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter to adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control in order to ensure that no iron deficiency could be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy alone , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or thereby , the body does not affect the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ie@@ tin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of epoxy al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the injection into a V@@ ene in the context of a main study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by reference to reference problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene , before they were either inj@@ ected or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of spec@@ kl@@ ed Ab@@ se@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study , patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al values were killed in the same size as for those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common minor effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , the occasionally to symptoms of a encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ raine and per@@ sever@@ ity .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ec@@ tin or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the medicine has been provided for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the requirements of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the safety of pharmaceuticals .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines of P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg , an approval for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed to the European Union .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al concentrations should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome and fol@@ lic@@ ences can be different depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical waste and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided during a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s can be observed in either patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration .
due to these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ ulator is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the durable hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ec@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that epoxy @-@ al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ aes@@ n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher production doses ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &lt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ omas and - fol@@ lic@@ ences can be different depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical waste and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
due to these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ec@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dose which is required for control of an@@ tivir@@ al symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction percentage has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 i.@@ e / kg once a week .

controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of epoxy compounds , when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al concentration is increased in concentration levels and prevent blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hypertension .

the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Re@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risks associated with respective patient who should also consider the specific clinical context .
patients who are intended for an enlarged orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery should be studied , if possible , in front of the ep@@ ec@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia was studied and treated accordingly .
patients suffering from an enlarged orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , an appropriate th@@ rom@@ ion proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis should have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vas@@ cul@@ ular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded from treatment with ep@@ ec@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting sample rate of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk for postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / v@@ ascular events can be found .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which spr@@ inkl@@ es the bones ) both in women and men .
patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) were applied , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic th@@ ump , such as the bone of bone , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hi@@ ft@@ y correction should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a , can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ ometric is used to evaluate acet@@ one .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of sp@@ inal and hi@@ ps over a period of three years .
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had suffered recently a stroke t@@ inc@@ ture ; it was investigated over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two trials in total 357 patients and compared with a frac@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds on bone substance ) or decreased by at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures were reduced in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to patients under placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo the risk of bo@@ di@@ ly frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip t@@ inc@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a correction ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less often with repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients that potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion body and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( extinc@@ tion of bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors , which contains acet@@ one for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who should be explained as well as similar material for patients who should consult the doctor &apos;s side effects .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently modified low @-@ traum@@ atic t@@ inc@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once per year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic t@@ inc@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip t@@ inc@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients receiving the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to a minimum of 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently switched low @-@ traum@@ atic t@@ inc@@ ture a Initi@@ al dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U@@ E. or in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion .
symptoms of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , can be reduced by administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients suffering from kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended , as limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients were similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended for the application for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as well as for this patient population only limited clinical experience .
prior to the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid , a temporary , mit@@ ochondri@@ al hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to a minimum of 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ er@@ disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be used before applying Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates to a denti@@ fied dental treatment with appropriate dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ists in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the patient doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
symptoms of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , can be reduced by administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of serious adverse effects of pre @-@ hop@@ ing cases were increased in patients who received Ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ant Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the tot@@ ality of acet@@ one ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasion@@ al ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. , an increase in serum @-@ circles ) and rare inst@@ ances as acute kidney failure in rare cases .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study with oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared with the Ac@@ last@@ y and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of treatment was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ one treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , in 2.3 % of patients with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received supplem@@ enting adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a r@@ amp @-@ t@@ inc@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion agency , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral area Occa@@ sional , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental handles .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients re@@ formed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in a pine area with Ac@@ last@@ a and in a placebo treated with placebo .
in case of over@@ dosage , which leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , can be achieved by the administration of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 @-@ 89 years ) with either a bone density or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing sp@@ inal body .
effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ inal frac@@ tures increased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new ver@@ teb@@ ral c@@ frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ last@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on stroke frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a demonstrated a constant effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced rate of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for bo@@ di@@ ly frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased the bone density to lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ic acid , hi@@ ps and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo @-@ treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the bone density of lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ral column by 6.7 % , the whole hi@@ ps by 6.0 % , of the stem level by 3.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ k@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic mud .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients with Ac@@ last@@ a treated patients compared to placebo by increasing the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the conservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ 1@@ NP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ sets from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periods of time periods .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage of acet@@ one reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial payment after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U@@ . oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall imm@@ ort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a treated group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D levels on the whole @-@ edge and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as at all time points .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to the placebo @-@ treatment with an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % of the total assets and 4.3 % on the bill .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised to 508 men and evaluated in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frag@@ ile in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated males in comparison to 8.7 % when placebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a relative to the percentage change from al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ si@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven mor@@ ing of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value at inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain may be observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as response of the six @-@ month main study on the response ( on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
out of 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 with ac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who were treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be achieved with 71 of the patients with ac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 percent of the mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ tically independent .
after that , the plasma bri@@ cks rapidly increased from &lt; 10 % to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
ru@@ st@@ ling bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with an terminal elim@@ ination cycle time t ½ h 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the quick res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion on the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the suggested dose in the ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound on bone tissue .
the whole body cle@@ aring is independent from the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentrations by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ entr@@ ation against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systeme is un@@ likely to metab@@ oli@@ zed - because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not metab@@ oli@@ zed - because it is a weak or even a direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly dependent inhib@@ itor of the P@@ 450@@ -

this results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney function interference up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
due to severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are possible , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest un@@ riv@@ alled intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies on dogs , single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was determined to obtain a total of 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to 7@@ x 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to 7@@ x of the human therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated ex@@ positions that have exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects of other organs , including gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and on the intraven@@ ous injection point .

the following table ( Table 1 ) illustrates the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who were treated to weight reduction and for supporting metab@@ olic diseases .
when the incidence was statistically significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ rate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects , the following characteristics are observed :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; sometimes ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ;
in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons administered up to 300 m@@ g. were observed , only light symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ li@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .

the difference of the medium weight change between the 20 m@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value for patients who had the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg had been taken by about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and around 50 % due to weight reduction . n E@@ IM Ar@@ z

5.3 clinical data for the security of un@@ wanted effects that were not observed in clinical trials , however , were considered to be relevant for clinical use in animals after exposure to exposure in human therapeutic areas :
in some cases , however , in all cases , the beginning of the conv@@ ul@@ sions with movable stress seems to be related to the dealing with animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertili@@ zation or cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Review Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the study evaluated the study carried out by the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations concerning the application of pharmaceuticals .
account is applied to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can &apos;t be used in patients ( especially over@@ weight treatment ) . • It can be applied together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ide hard foam or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ ide is maintained and ins@@ ulin with the beginning of acet@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ ur resin and ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s body is better to be util@@ ised and reduced blood sugar , thereby reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ide in addition , they received either acet@@ ate or placebo for 3.5 years .
in the studies , concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
the account led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value that reduces blood sugar levels in use of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the ple@@ a therapy study , the effect of acet@@ ate treatment of acet@@ ate and a sul@@ fon@@ yl alcohol showed a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional application of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ ate and ins@@ ulin was investigated in 289 patients , patients receiving acet@@ ate A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo and placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with acet@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections ( path@@ ogens ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not react to patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ( high level of level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard therapy with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for marketing of marketing to marketing to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , hence the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should begin to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced kar@@ st reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and eye levels when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced spot@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible .
if a patient is developed symptoms such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , colon@@ isation problems , ti@@ red@@ ness , appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzyme values .
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ able weight gain was detected , which can stir in fatty deposits and in some cases with a fluid failure .
as a result of a hem@@ el@@ ution , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a reduced reduction of medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies using Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity in patients who received Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dual @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ tive h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , reported on an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar if there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , however , the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a must be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ irable events concerning bone breaks , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fragments per 100 patients with women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient has a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on do not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with pharmaceuticals , metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , Cyc@@ los@@ por@@ in , calcium inhib@@ itor and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fib@@ ro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhib@@ itor ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attributable to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one that reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the womb and reduces the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Cultural &apos;s growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( available from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the frac@@ tions of the lens , as they are also observed in other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active ingredients .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents appeared beyond the triple the upper limit of the standard range similar to placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced spot@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on respectively .
since its market launch , rarely has been reported using con@@ ges@@ tive suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with in@@ suff@@ iciency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of noti@@ fications were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with reference medi@@ ation treated groups .
during a period of over a period of 3,5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparable medi@@ ation .
when taking a total dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day spent seven days and no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears on a activation of specific nuclear receptor inhib@@ itor ( P@@ PA@@ R g g ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , grease and sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ine cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose recovery in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were in@@ sufficient in spite of three months , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to have ins@@ ulin @-@ treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials over a year there was a statistically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ des compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , a reduction of the total plasma @-@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was detected in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de mirror , which is based on a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to hep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a cardiovascular study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced des@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups that have been treated with either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is res@@ or@@ ated quickly , with the top concentrations of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma is usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV is equivalent to the efficacy of the efficiency of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on could not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral application of radioactive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in the Mitt@@ ens ( 55 % ) and a lower extent of the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to humans 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ ric of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the inst@@ al@@ ments of oral cle@@ aring is similar .

this is attributable to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one that reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the womb and thereby reduces the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Cultural &apos;s growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased intra@@ ten@@ dencies of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in a animal model of famili@@ ari@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans led to an increased incidence of colonies .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fragments per 100 patients with women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study about two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year there was a statistically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ des compared to the initial values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de mirror , which has a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ inal synthesis .

in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as is not able to produce ins@@ ulin , type 2 diabetes , the ins@@ ulin is not capable of utili@@ zing the ins@@ ulin .
after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Reflection , which clearly showed that blood sugar levels were similar to another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already performed signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ons , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or exposure scar@@ ves ( &quot; stones &quot; of the h . greater primi@@ tive cryst@@ alli@@ ons , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary aci@@ d@@ spar is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , the patients may still occur ; therefore , during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , patients can still take another medicine to the prevention of genetic material .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had a body transplan@@ tation , since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study conducted at 1 0@@ 72 patients the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( pseud@@ o @-@ drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the primary indic@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary aci@@ d@@ spar in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients that Aden@@ ur@@ ic had a dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily taken 120 mg , with the last three measurements at the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , and not one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients suffering from cardi@@ ac problems , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects may affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was effective in the lo@@ wering of the ur@@ inary aci@@ d@@ spar in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels could be .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases associated with ur@@ ine deposits ( including one from the health history or at present se@@ gregation and / or coating ) .
after 2 @-@ 4 weeks after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , the serum can still be considered 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose of dose can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients suffering from severe kidney function , efficacy and safety are not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transplan@@ t noted when there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ tation , the application of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with mixed heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ mamm@@ alian medicines , it can occur during treatment beginning to a acute ne@@ ath , because through the lo@@ wering of the serum co@@ d@@ aci@@ d@@ aci@@ d@@ spar initially , ur@@ aci@@ al acidity can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues .
B . in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the ur@@ ine in rare cases is so far reaching that it comes to a re@@ location of the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease during Phase 3 clinical studies were observed in minor impair@@ ment of liver enzymes in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ al treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was done no exchange studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhib@@ ition can lead to an increase in The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( a inhib@@ ition of the metabolism of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhib@@ itors ) .
in the test subjects , F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhib@@ itors are not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of un@@ wanted events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without any dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active substance .
in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily obtained a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhib@@ it@@ or@@ ic effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It was shown that the simultaneous use of a Ant@@ azi@@ a , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , contains the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t leave any side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave any direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxation of a vehicle , operating on machines or during the exercise of dangerous activities , which AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can not affect their performance .
a rich@@ ly higher incidence of reference reported cardiovascular events in the Pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) were observed , although no statistically significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were arter@@ i@@ os@@ kl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , or a de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasion@@ al ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at @-@ treatment groups with more than once , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , no serious skin attacks or severe hyper@@ sensitivity are observed .
7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
those related events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those who were reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and performed in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to information .

the lo@@ wering of serum resistance to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function constra@@ int ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of the percentage of serum levels of serum and serum levels ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed that the lasting extension of the Phase 3 showed that the lasting lo@@ wering of serum levels spread to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients have required treatment against a coating of exposure ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the ratio of friction , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the exposure until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the maximum plasma cent@@ ric center ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma cent@@ ric @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ si@@ proportional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is higher than the dos@@ si@@ proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg of 1 x daily , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum and serum concentration where this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which one risk exists for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid a matur@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take place until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to present that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is precisely the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss .

the following critics are to be exact to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed by day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not dis@@ si@@ eve the tablet or tablet during the first food intake of the day that should take the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered in adult patients with a n@@ asty or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent im@@ pregn@@ ation of the transplan@@ t by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main indi@@ an of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was dischar@@ ged after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ intake of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies were performed on 119 patients suffering from kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investigated how Adv@@ ance is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ or ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) as well as ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against tac@@ tile antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f cannot be used .
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines can be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should be classified or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transplan@@ ts or increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always retain the same tac@@ it formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ orders of formulation or regime should only be performed under narrow inspection of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
following a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ is@@ sions must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Dos@@ age dosage should be based on clinical assessment of degra@@ dation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ reflective terms ( see below ) Recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ grave on Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dam should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations for kidney transplan@@ ts as well as le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate gra@@ ten@@ ment phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f Dos@@ age schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution ) using a dose of ca .
duration of application to supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must not be specified , consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale de@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily operation in the morning .
further dos@@ ages can be later required since the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale de@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily operation in the morning .
Dos@@ age recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ grave on Adv@@ agra@@ f must be switched on twice daily dosage of pro@@ found@@ f to once daily taking from Adv@@ agra@@ f to take this change in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose to take place .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a switch from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily the treatment with the recommended initi@@ als recommended for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation must begin .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initi@@ als of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily .
other transplan@@ ts , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ kened patients were used in an oral initi@@ als of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day and for rec@@ tal transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ als of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for rec@@ tal transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ als of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ age adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain Bl@@ utt@@ al@@ mirror in the targeted area may be required for patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no effect on pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of tac@@ rop@@ lim@@ us , may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f in the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a tac@@ tile @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in the whole blood is the first line on clinical assessment of demo@@ li@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual waste under assistance of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ si controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks while the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ grave on Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes to immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy or at simultaneous application of substances that could be controlled ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , the dose may require several days , until the ste@@ ady state came into force .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Tal@@ ks not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with heart@@ ed transplan@@ ts at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft transplan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of tac@@ tics or over@@ exposure .
patients should always retain the same tac@@ it formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ orders of formulation or regime should only be performed under narrow inspection of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to be other immun@@ os@@ u@@ de@@ press@@ ants , not yet clinical data for ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ tation received no clinical data for ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interaction , which may lead to a coating of the tac@@ tile mirror in the blood and a we@@ aker of clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of herbal supplements that include cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or avoid other plant @-@ related agents during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in blood because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , aqu@@ eous humor or sep@@ tic hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ies was observed in rare cases , which therefore may also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces , are an existing heart @-@ suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hypertension or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ burden and est@@ rogen .
like other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ igner , due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor .
if patients who use Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of p@@ res such as head@@ ache , changed levels of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radical study ( eg .
since Adv@@ ices contain hard capsules , l@@ act@@ ose , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels in con@@ current treatment of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly influenced interaction with anti@@ mon@@ ks such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibio@@ tic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly result from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to inhib@@ iting the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly automated pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute ab@@ bing reactions , can increase the concentration of tac@@ rop@@ lim@@ us in blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ rop@@ lim@@ us with medicines being metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us minim@@ ise the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contra@@ sts and so that hor@@ mone exposure may increase , especially c@@ auti@@ ously by decisions of receiving measures .
the results of animal experim@@ entation have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a low number of investigations on transplan@@ tation patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of un@@ wanted events , with regard to the course and earnings of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to potential adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .

cases of BK @-@ virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated advanced multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ ic@@ ia ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ reg@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it has reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ icious ne@@ op@@ last@@ y including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and r@@ hin@@ ts in combination with tac@@ rop@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ c@@ ytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sing .
the effects of tac@@ tics and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level can be medi@@ ated by its binding on a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment in the cell@@ ars .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ re@@ dependent inhib@@ ition of signal transmission paths in T cells and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain range of lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and inhib@@ iting lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ inter@@ feron ) as well as the expression of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

in total , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies indicate the observations of the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation was used to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ reg@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis via a recent , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the first year after the transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome , was observed in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in Tac@@ ro@@ intestinal and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , there came to 2@@ 1,7 % of cases for the emer@@ gence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % at Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ tation , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the l@@ ung@@ es @-@ treated patients of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group larger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study conducted with oral care was conducted at 205 patients who simultaneously received treatment of pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation , which received a randomised procedure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by Protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then to reach the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ ts The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f showed primary transplan@@ tation in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ker thicknesses , additional gift of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ists , lead to Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ yc@@ lo@@ id and low protein concentrations , which led to an increase in the uncer@@ tain faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or through treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ al ero@@ ids are to be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed after transplan@@ tation .
this can be done that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metab@@ oli@@ zed - whereby the ex@@ its is mainly done via the g@@ all .
for stable patients who were converted by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) at Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) at the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than under Pro@@ grave for nearly 10 % lower than Pro@@ grave .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks while the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ation ) are used .
the dosage and frequency of application is after that Adv@@ ate is used for treating blood canc@@ ers or the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack of blood problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of forming the human t@@ inner factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar in the European Union of approved medic@@ inal products called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins and animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of pharmaceuticals was investigated for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical interventions .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ata was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; for prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in 86 % of 510 % .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are diz@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to bring an approval for the placing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dose and duration of the sub@@ stitu@@ tive therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defect , after the place and the degree of blood and clinical status of the patient .
the following h@@ ill@@ or rh@@ ag@@ ic events shall not sink the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period specified under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in i.@@ e / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is present for the patient .
during treatment process , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections stim@@ ulated the appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo Recovery and different semi @-@ ties .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis found in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.@@ e of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be achieved or when blood is controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to detect a inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy must not be effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the formulation is to be found after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhib@@ itors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhib@@ itors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is related within the first 20 consecutive exposure days at the biggest and genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhib@@ itors , after conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lowest ) inhib@@ itors is observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
inhib@@ itors of A@@ DR@@ s were inhib@@ itors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which have previously untreated patients who have higher risk for formation of inhib@@ itors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and diz@@ zin@@ ess ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) of the unexpected waste of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ in@@ fusion .
blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained during all time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and the cle@@ aring rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .

in addition , there was no more than 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe ag@@ grav@@ ated H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) in previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII In@@ hib@@ itor .
in previously untreated patients treated with an ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by exam@@ ining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant up@@ turn and an ongoing peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms appear on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be considered positive , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ S every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder must apply another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited published the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company takes his application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the wheat parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus , genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was so altered that there will be no copies of themselves and cannot remove any infections in human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the tum@@ ours , Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the non def@@ ective in human body , normally contributes to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s Cancer at which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein works correctly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company put up data from a study with one patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of construction , in the bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the asked questions , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on testing the documents submitted , CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent by the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will bring benefits to patients .
the committee had further concerns relating to the processing of pharmaceuticals in the body , the method of administration and safety of pharmaceuticals .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ances can be produced in reliable mode , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal have consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that tablets are thus composed so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic ten@@ dencies ( h@@ ay fever ) caused by a allerg@@ y against pol@@ len ( nas@@ al infections ) in patients with nose mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ( hidden n@@ oses ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ed nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drug may be left to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated by a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ crit@@ es symptoms , in addition to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who revenues aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze reported by a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 3@@ 5,@@ 9 % in the patients who alone was contrac@@ ted by pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
when only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7,4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diz@@ zin@@ ess , fatigue , ti@@ red@@ ness , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ni@@ otic ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may not be in@@ sensitive to patients suffering from des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze can also not be used in patients that suffer from a bott@@ len@@ angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hypertension ) or ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by brain circulation ) or have a risk for ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to provide approval for the marketing of aer@@ onau@@ tics in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is too swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break , break or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the error of data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after clinical symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because at long time application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can be cancelled with the time .
after the decline of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with pro@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itors or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ d@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ter such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , oxy@@ ch@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ dy@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked and the data are not sufficient to send corresponding recommendations to dosage .
the safety and the efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients suffering from kidney or liver function and do not submit the data to express appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the patients must be informed about the treatment of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ carri@@ ages , heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ g other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache , or a gain of head@@ ache ) .
treatment of following patients &quot; patients are recommended to be careful : • Pati@@ ents with a heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ sports in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or in their extent .
in addition to clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma cent@@ ric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
there were no significant differences between the patients suffering from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether pro@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or alcohol was taken .
the enzymes responsible for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme has not been identified so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals cannot be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate for the P @-@ glyc@@ op@@ rot@@ one is not inhib@@ ited .
the in@@ fertility of the application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences of a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the pre@@ valence of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and cannot be applied to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ical properties of pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular col@@ li@@ se ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) .
head@@ ache , anxiety , stag@@ gering micro @-@ tion , muscle weak@@ nesses and increased musc@@ ular stress , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , preventive pain , diz@@ zin@@ ess , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ y , t@@ end@@ ous disorders , hypertension or h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely to be , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , P@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ adi@@ re and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ ation , Hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal Symptoms ) .
these include both inhib@@ ition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as inhib@@ ition of expression of the adj@@ uv@@ ant P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables including the rein@@ forcement of subj@@ ective pun@@ ches or tasks that are connected with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of ra@@ inf@@ all was observed in comparison to placebo during the recommended dose of 5 mg .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic ten@@ itis , with 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets were determined based on the overall score for symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on Day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ sier study that was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was bad .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety immun@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated treatment , for m@@ yc@@ otox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with pro@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive neuro@@ surgery studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application agreement described Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ System is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect can un@@ fold .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets , which occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , like Ni@@ esen , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling eyes with con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

tell your doctor if you occur under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze following symptoms or diseases : • hypertension , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache , or a strengthening of existing head@@ ache .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines , even if it is not prescription drugs .
transportation and use of machines At use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to diz@@ zin@@ ess or the attention .
if you have taken a larger quantity of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , then you should immediately call your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you should have a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .

it is available as 5 mg @-@ tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets , which dis@@ solve in mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for inclusion .
for children aged 1 to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ a .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal allergic ten@@ dencies and two studies on patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and magn@@ itude of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to verify that the body util@@ ises the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and melting tablets in the same way , how the tablets and the application are harm@@ less in children .
based on allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been compiled , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us were caused by an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a reduction of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the sympt@@ om scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to provide approval for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for adolescents aged between 12 and 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of an anti @-@ hypo@@ allergi@@ en@@ r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the previous post @-@ clinical symptoms and may be resum@@ ed with their return .
in the pers@@ ist allergic ten@@ dencies ( symptoms of symptoms on 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during a lasting treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , treatment of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not enhanced by alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the patients , however , should be clari@@ fied that it may occur in very rare cases of diz@@ zin@@ ess , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when they were treated with placebo .
the most frequently occurring side effects , on which more commonly referred to placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dial@@ ogs ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years the most common cause of head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and treated with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhib@@ ition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as inhib@@ ition of expression of the adj@@ uv@@ ant P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple boxes , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in a dose of up to 20 mg had been administered every 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ ab@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the non @-@ fold the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ si@@ - study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables including the rein@@ forcement of subj@@ ective pun@@ ches or tasks that are connected with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ sec@@ tion , and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ cane and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown using the overall positive rate of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the gra@@ zing loads caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology considers the e@@ dic@@ ology of different forms , and chronic patients can be sim@@ ulated .
as the hist@@ amine faced by a significant factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is expressed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria in addition to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who didn &apos;t react to anti@@ hist@@ amine , out of the study .
improvement of the serum concentration of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and juni@@ per , as determined by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate those variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable to patients @-@ Dem@@ ograph@@ ical Rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no connection points for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme was not yet identified so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals cannot be excluded completely

the prescription physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that treatment of an inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory failure or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , in case of diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and cut@@ outs should play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metab@@ oli@@ zed - disin@@ teg@@ ration ( see below section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metab@@ oli@@ zed - is identical to the children that are normally metab@@ oli@@ zed -
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption , or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , treatment of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied without alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the total number of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us si@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when in patients who were treated with placebo .
during a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 , who came to question an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in are similar in adults and children , can extra@@ pol@@ ate the efficacy data from des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults to the children &apos;s population .
within a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in a dose of up to 20 mg had been applied daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ ab@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied for more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , during the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , increased frequency of ra@@ inf@@ all was observed in comparison to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical studies , not any impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults it occurred either by simultaneous use of alcohol neither to a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ airs to an increase of ra@@ inf@@ all .
for adult and adoles@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ sec@@ tion , and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ cane and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown using the overall positive rate of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively emphasi@@ zed the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this limited metab@@ oli@@ zed phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ ine ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. were officially adopted by the Committee on Human Use of Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , with the approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for preventing the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 virus in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people for protection against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a tribe of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new tribe of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus ret@@ ched by man , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of vacc@@ ines , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of influenza in the vaccine as &quot; physical alien . &quot;
this makes the immune system later in the position to form an flu by Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this ancest@@ or faster antibody .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti @-@ membran@@ es &quot; ( proteins on membran@@ es , which detect the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , was isolated and used as an integral part of the vaccine .
some of the study sites showed that the study had not been carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine is not to fulfil the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA pre@@ pan@@ demic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules can be taken as a solution for inclusion , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be sub@@ stituted if the doctor has reviewed what an@@ tivir@@ al drugs of the patient had previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood assessed that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily taken with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ sign is based on body weight .
as@@ es@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
AIDS is not to heal AIDS , however , the damage to the immune system and thereby hes@@ it@@ ating the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ing .
this with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase has been compared with 206 adults who were compared with other prot@@ ectors .
main indi@@ an for efficacy was the proportion of patients with det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who previously did not have a prot@@ eas@@ ants , after 48 weeks , more patients had a virus load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , however , of the children who had been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers only very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated previously with prot@@ eas@@ ers , that were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced Medic@@ us@@ last after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ eas@@ ants :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it came to A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continue to increase their previous prot@@ eas@@ ers :
the most common A@@ gener@@ ase Side Effects ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ously must not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who are cur@@ ated ( a vegetable preparation for treating depression ) or medicines that are just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients suffering from HIV , taking the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body tissue ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( extinc@@ tion of bone tissue ) or a immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmaceuticals for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children above four years compared to risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee set that the benefits of as@@ sign in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken a prot@@ eas@@ ant .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information templates .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ ster@@ y of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inclusion is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , eight @-@ generation capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram dosage ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ generic in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ectors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the application for children under 4 years , due to the error of data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose to a@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increased to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that own a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , which include Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma centr@@ alized and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r during taking am@@ a@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should not be referred to that as@@ tig@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection , that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevented the risk of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , ants should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmaceuticals ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk of severe liver interaction with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the related information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis demonstrates an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ the@@ or@@ ids that can be conf@@ used via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ id effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the an@@ nex function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction @-@ inhib@@ itor Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of as@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are available to determine the concentration of active concentration .
for patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be effective for reduced plasma levels of ampl@@ itude ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic interactions with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ sts can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
when Meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ angl@@ ers , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity because of the high prop@@ yl car@@ c@@ coli solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ing inhib@@ itor , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an extraction of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases , to their therapy , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders , associated .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( Type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ def@@ ective , an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ ist infections can develop , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial field is assumed ( including application of Kor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ reg@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic l@@ atitude must not be given simultaneously with medicines that own a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with medicines whose ingredients are mainly conf@@ used via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an anti @-@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma levels by a dose @-@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
car@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) The serum levels of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) .
if a patient already occupies Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ ro@@ av@@ ir@@ ons are , and , if possible , to review the vir@@ us@@ load and add the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice a day in combination with Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that demonstrate the effectiveness and effectiveness of this treatment schem@@ as .
52 % dri@@ es when Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg / Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r was achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , about 40 @-@ 50 % lower than Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is a close monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
it was not a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial for the application of o@@ gener@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ azi@@ des component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , it is necessary for the gift of ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustments required .
treatment with am@@ o@@ vi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ vi@@ r treatment is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would re@@ ap .
the effect of neo @-@ pin on other prot@@ eas@@ ers and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , if Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if this medicine is applied together , caution must be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are being difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous application of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma cent@@ ric ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin in about 193 % and therefore an increase in the inner side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data are pre@@ valent .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with aging in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fossil@@ s with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of fossil@@ s with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with a@@ generic drugs , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be related to toxic reactions that are combined with these pharmaceuticals , if they are used in combination with a@@ generic .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time like A@@ gener@@ ase , as there can be res@@ or@@ tive problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as an enzyme is known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma bri@@ cks of Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .
the serum concentration of Cal@@ ci@@ di@@ kan@@ al@@ blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , pin pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ pine , ni@@ pp@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous taking with A@@ gener@@ ase , the plas@@ mak@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric can considerably increase and strengthen the side effects including h@@ yp@@ oten@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % in@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ id effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are significantly expected to increase plasma levels when att@@ aching A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma derivatives of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors can lead to my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended a frequency monitoring of therapeutic levels until stabilization of mirror , since the plas@@ mak@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric of Cyc@@ los@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased when used by Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral Complaints Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while applying A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ers indicate a possible increase in plasma levels from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to transfer 3 to 4 tor@@ ache .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for o@@ pi@@ racy sympt@@ om , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of its low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ ot@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is administered when Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased monitoring of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for conception prevention are recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied for the mother in comparison with the possible risk of use for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ act@@ ating rats , Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known to sur@@ passes Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r in people with breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the immersion in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation in the uter@@ ine until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the after@@ mat@@ h .
the further development of income including fertili@@ zation and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the incidence of aging has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most connected side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly until moderate early in early morning and led to the treatment of treatment .
for many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if it is related to taking a@@ generic drugs or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a result of gr@@ ill@@ ary disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ectors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ational medical examination in connection with study medication , were performed at more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) associated with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ ous fat accumulation ( bul@@ locks ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral people who were treated with Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ ine in a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( bul@@ let ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients under Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin attacks were normally easily broken up to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ul@@ op@@ ap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without that the treatment with am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r had to be broken .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
for HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ def@@ ective , the response of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ ist infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ do@@ cked Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , which were given in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ do@@ cked Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very frequent .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed for signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures must be entered .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ ming@@ le concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cell and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhib@@ ition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ab@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhib@@ itors - the described mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of fossil @-@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients treated with four neurolog@@ ical failure occurred on 96 weeks , the following prot@@ eas@@ ant mut@@ ations :
on gen@@ otype resistance testing @-@ based analysis , genetic interpre@@ ting systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation sm@@ u@@ sters can subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to utili@@ ze the current interpretation systems for analysis of resistance tests .
in the phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis , clinical evaluation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generated a certain cross @-@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , clo@@ ve avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ vi@@ r remain in general .
there are currently data about cross @-@ resistant and other prot@@ eas@@ ers for all 4 fossil@@ s resistance p@@ act , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , in which a fossil ren@@ dition opposed to ra@@ inf@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the vice @-@ vers@@ a re@@ tains the activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment .

one hundred and six@@ ty @-@ thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to aging , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ ordin@@ ance threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution was taken three times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI was previously administered at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value .
19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered under the expected benefit of &apos; un@@ touched &apos; A@@ gener@@ ase in patients with PI pre @-@ treated children .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by food intake , although the simultaneous nutritional intake was influenced and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption was influenced .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r to the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ o@@ vi@@ r , which remains the active portion , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ folded Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing pump in dependence on the aggreg@@ ate drug concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state above the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drug use the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhib@@ it or inhib@@ it a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ously ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ ins@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r exposure as adults with an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ore@@ available as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ously solution and eight @-@ phase capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ lig@@ ible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be the elim@@ ination of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ as lead to Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r plasma samples that are compared to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred at male animals of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ oma at doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is unc@@ le@@ ar .
from the present exposure data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ genetic tests , the bacterial reverse testing ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro@@ core test to rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes , was Am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r nor genetically modified .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of treatment .
studies on the tox@@ icity with young , who were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both the controls as well as with the children treated with am@@ a@@ ca@@ ine treated animals a high mortality rate .
during a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposition under therapeutic dose , however , a series of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ related sk@@ el@@ ong@@ ings were observed , which indicates a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised ratio ) are available to determine the concentration of active concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher ageing and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an anti @-@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice a day in combination with Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r was achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , about 40 @-@ 50 % lower than Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is a close monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
treatment with am@@ o@@ vi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ vi@@ r treatment is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would re@@ ap .
if this medicine is applied together , caution must be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are being difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is used together with a@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data are pre@@ valent .
the serum concentration of calcium chloride , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , di@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ pine , ni@@ pp@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % in@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased monitoring of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r by 22 % resp@@ .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied to the possible risks for the fet@@ us during pregnancy , in comparison with the possible risks for the mother .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the immersion in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation in the uter@@ ine until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase in the body weight during the halt .
the incidence of aging has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed for signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures must be entered .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ ming@@ le concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cell and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cell ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
the vice @-@ vers@@ a re@@ tains the activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered to be considered to be affected by &apos; un@@ touched &apos; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ a@@ ca@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ encies in dependence on the aggreg@@ ate drug concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state in the ste@@ ady @-@ state over the areas of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drug use the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhib@@ it or inhib@@ it a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ously ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ lig@@ ible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function is due to the elim@@ ination of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred at male animals of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ oma at doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ m@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .

studies on the tox@@ icity with young , who were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both the controls as well as with the children treated with am@@ a@@ ca@@ ine treated animals a high mortality rate .
these results suggest that in ma@@ ize the metabolism of metabol@@ ites are not fully approved , so Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ously solution for inclusion was neither associated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inclusion is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , eight @-@ generation capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram dosage ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able once they are able to swal@@ low capsules with taking the solution to stop taking ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dos@@ ed recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ ting and low @-@ do@@ cked Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patients .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ yo@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is not necessary , is an application of a@@ generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reactions as a result of high prop@@ yl car@@ c@@ coli , A@@ gener@@ a solution for infants and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients suffering from kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive inhib@@ ition of the metabolism of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects like heart rhyth@@ ms ( z ) .
patients should not be referred to that as@@ ants or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection , and that it still continues to develop opport@@ un@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevented the risk of 47 of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are available to determine the concentration of active concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( Type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an anti @-@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice a day in combination with Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ i capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

main indi@@ an for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete extraction of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ants .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a patients , the results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a total reduction of 66 % to 80 % in patients with al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) reactions to the application place of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ic seeds ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p at immune @-@ compet@@ encies , if the size or number of les@@ ions are contra@@ indicated or less suitable for treatment of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and to leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long continued until all the visible barrels of the genital or peri@@ ors have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered for intensive local inflammation ( see Section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment area one infection is observed .
if a follow @-@ up examination of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions have only been completely healed that any other therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was left out , the patient under@@ wear the cream once he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is up in a thin layer and ru@@ b in a thin layer and ru@@ b the skin area , until the cream is completely covered .
in these cases , there should be a consideration between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and associated with a potential disper@@ sion of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these cases , there should be a consideration between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ@@ ise or gra@@ ft versus Host@@ - response .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ oring was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ ants were observed , and a case with a circumcision of leading strips .
during an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) in rare cases were observed even under practical application severe local skin irrit@@ ation which require treatment and / or caused by temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such a reaction at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra had occurred , some women had difficulties in the ur@@ ination , requiring a disaster cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous resources for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ces in genital and periods we have no clinical experience .
limited data indicate an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has demonstrated a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair offset was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions are generally accepted during therapy and reactions to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints , or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , treatment plans can be made of several days .
the clinical results of the therapy can be assessed after the re@@ plen@@ ishment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be drawn at super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma and other suitable therapy forms in consider@@ ations .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that with large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) the probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists of .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine was not investigated for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or in the lip@@ stick area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take intensity to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream .
if the local skin reaction will cause big dis@@ comfort , or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for some days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acts les@@ ions have a lower complete healing rate compared to patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
because of immun@@ o@@ stim@@ ulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who received immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not go directly or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / federal development , the development of embry@@ onic development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
even after one @-@ time , neither after one @-@ time of top@@ ical application , quanti@@ fied serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be reached , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently shared or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in connection with three weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of treatment of the gra@@ dients ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients ) .
among the most frequently reported and probably with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context @-@ related side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated with a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients ) .
the side effects that were given by 252 into placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials in patients with ac@@ yc@@ lo@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ak@@ t@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below .
according to the pre @-@ controlled clinical study , the clinical study showed that it was frequently observed in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three weekly treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream frequently ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , optic cup / de@@ pot ( 23 % ) and oil ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the evaluation plan , the clinical indication of the clinical signs showed that it was very common in these studies with five @-@ time treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream very often with heavy er@@ y@@ topics ( 13 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe chocolate formation ( 19 % ) .
for clinical trials investig@@ ating I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s treatment for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was determined with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment place or in the surrounding area .
the accid@@ ental unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 kg , could cause nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically important side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , system@@ ic concentrations of the Alph@@ a@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the inc@@ lines during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to placebo treatment over 16 weeks .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients were complete ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete transmission was achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine at five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elle bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the report consists of an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years , showing some 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also stayed for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ents for three weeks time in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non hyper@@ t@@ ato@@ tic , non hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ic Ak@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trial .
the approved indications , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , and super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma are usually not applied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials at the age of 2 to 15 years with Moll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine could not be shown during these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine spread through the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ t@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml for the use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ tention of pharmaceuticals in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after top@@ ical application was low in the age of 6 - 12 years low and compared with healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ ber@@ ian bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the anter@@ ior tox@@ icity of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a similar four @-@ month study included in the mouse had no similar effects during the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with three days a week induced no tum@@ ours at the application site .
the appropriate mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ das to view the risk of human exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice , treated with the real @-@ free cream , and in larger numbers , than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was measured , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by investig@@ ating its effect on the reduction of the g@@ ag concentration in the ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) .
in children under five years of sen@@ su@@ ed Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the g@@ ag concentrations in the ur@@ ine was about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal big liver on the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , ar@@ gin@@ stal@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat sens@@ ation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and cr@@ ushing .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other components ( allergic reactions ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may be announced , and updating this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. an approval of the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stick of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ time enzyme in patients with sigh@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ h@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor , experience in treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited substance diseases .
the initial rate of in@@ fusion rates of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , every 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no do@@ cking scheme is recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no do@@ cking scheme is recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as each in connection , which occurs during the in@@ fusion , or until the end of the in@@ fusion . ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically those patients should continue to be eng@@ ined , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the recovery of medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment date .
patients who have antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution in use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as a little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theoretical risk , a hyper@@ sensitivity result should be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of slight or medium @-@ duty in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / ib@@ u@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ ke and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ condition reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are taken to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is being aw@@ ak@@ ened .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not leave any direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated over the breast milk , is recommended to ste@@ al during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical studies were classified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable pharmaceutical reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at an treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and l@@ ungs in the history , severe reactions came to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ sports , respiratory and facial expressions ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ des@@ irable pharmaceutical @-@ effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a total treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a severe de@@ structive form , mostly within one month ( on average after 26 days , compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) patients were detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ell@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay demonstr@@ able antibodies - including 3 patients , where it never had to be Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical .
patients with lack of low @-@ antibodies - a robust reduction in the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ p , while in patients with high antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was found .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal to a low @-@ neutral inhib@@ it@@ or@@ ic effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed not imp@@ aired by clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical reactions , although the occurrence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical reactions were typically co@@ inci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for enc@@ yc@@ line therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed from cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ ists , most likely to know @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were survey@@ ed from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient had the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a constant exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute limit in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the Plac@@ eb@@ og@@ upe an improvement of the lung function and the ability to be represented in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining the effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decline of the percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant in these period , and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with an hep@@ at@@ al treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear@@ er waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror was detected in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant at the end of the trial .
in terms of the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who , by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes were inter@@ linked to five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients who were at the time of her recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a magn@@ itude growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was detected after the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form only limited or no progress in co@@ gni@@ tive development .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a other drug against cancer ) when the cancer is not re@@ gre@@ eted ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ity &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant drug may not easily be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( caused by an operation alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; of lung cancer , which does not affect the epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who previously were not covered , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously used other chem@@ o@@ therapies as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced or decre@@ ases .
thus , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA , preventing the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes into cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of pharmaceuticals and leng@@ th@@ wise in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously used chemotherapy was to receive an average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7.9 months in Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies patients , however , in which cancer does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta extended survival .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. an approval for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each passage bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0.9 % of sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , except for prev@@ ailing epi@@ th@@ eli@@ oral hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after preceding chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
reduction in frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treatment as well as the day after treatment a Kor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake needs to be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for a further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , as well as any third release cycle .
in patients who have P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , should be created before every gift a complete blood @-@ image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ yc@@ lo@@ od .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the start of a new treatment course , a dose test will be taking place under Con@@ sider the blood cl@@ one or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ ge@@ - h@@ itting therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 Blood .
to develop patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of 3 ( with the exception of neur@@ otox@@ ins ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient must decrease the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dose reductions , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ otox@@ ins .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , compared to patients aged 65 years , an elevated rate of tri@@ vi@@ - ko exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the application with children under 18 years of age not adequate data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustments required for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjustments .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; from the upper limit value ( with metast@@ ases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not investigated especially in the studies .
patients must be administered in patients with regard to the bone mar@@ g@@ ation and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ ho@@ ur@@ ism has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neutr@@ ality number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ yc@@ lo@@ count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of level 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity like neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was considered to be a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients have to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 , as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ actic measure for reducing tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re is intended to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation is to be replaced with a drainage of the erg@@ ent in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ alised lives ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible pe@@ di@@ fication of re@@ productive capability due to po@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be assigned to treatment g@@ inn , advice regarding the sperm coating .

therefore , be@@ ware , if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the inter@@ re@@ ac@@ tionary than with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib lie , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ inc@@ in@@ izing status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ interactions between oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary , challenging and after careful persist@@ ing of user for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity due to po@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be assigned to the treatment beginning , advice regarding the sper@@ mat@@ on@@ ser@@ vie@@ do .
it is not known that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the breast milk passes and un@@ wanted effects of the rising inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received treatment medi@@ ation in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ ar cre@@ denti@@ sy@@ mptom@@ sk@@ ala in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms are characterised by an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of the lung function during the time in the controller .
a multi @-@ centre , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC to prior chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
a analysis of the influence of the hist@@ ology on the treatment effect fell to favor of AL@@ IM@@ TA with a predominantly non @-@ epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate randomised phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination over gem@@ cit@@ abine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
the middle grade PFS was 4.8 months for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine cis@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology to the survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .

it is applied in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) from ≥ 28 kg per square metre together with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ induced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and don &apos;t take weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
if these enzymes are inhib@@ ited , they can &apos;t waste some fats in food , thereby causing a quarter of those with food @-@ guided fats in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared with an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving allerg@@ y in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no one could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ eling , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , flu@@ ence sections ( win@@ ch ) , fl@@ yers ( win@@ ch ) , and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organism in transplan@@ tation ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ b syndrome ( which are not sufficient nutrients from the diges@@ tive disease ) or in cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the placing on the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a lightweight hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ al @-@ induced nutrition .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is no sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ated , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken with a fat @-@ fat or gre@@ asy food .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is able to proceed with improved metab@@ olic control , patients who should consult a medicine or pharmac@@ ist before beginning of therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti @-@ diabe@@ tic medication may be adjusted .
patients , all@@ i , as well as medicines for hypertension or increased Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage must be adjusted to this medicine .
it is recommended to prevent additional sw@@ elling measures to prevent the prevention of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tions in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both medicines in a study of interactions and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in study was observed in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ aliz@@ ations might be affected ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient amount of vitamin ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers received at the same time , or@@ list@@ at simultaneously observed the audit@@ orium of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plas@@ mak@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of pharmaceuticals , because the absorption of genom@@ ic fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known adverse events that were found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain@@ ty .
† Es is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ ici@@ encies in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical examination .
during the majority of the cases notified by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on human and animal , from a quick re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects that are attributable to or@@ list@@ at properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect puts the therapeutic effect in the lum@@ ens of stomach and upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ atic li@@ ds .
clinical studies was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily taken by the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ al induced nutrition .
the primary parameters , alter@@ ation of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of the body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial balance ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed above 12 months , the greatest weight loss was observed in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

note the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
which quantity is suitable for you , remove the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of operation , compliance with recommended fat intake is decisive .
if you have the same amount of fat as far as so far , this means that your body can not process these amount of fat .
through compliance with recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the probability for nutritional @-@ related items . • You should attempt to progres@@ sively increase gradually and continuously .
34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to progres@@ sively lose about 0.5 kg a week without any fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Ger@@ inge physical activity &quot; means that you may use only little or not go , stairs to work in the garden or other physical activities , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat @-@ targets and to keep them too . • T@@ oo@@ king is a nutrition journal with information to cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move , before you start with taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i programme for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of additional information materials which can help you to feed and feed @-@ and @-@ fet@@ al , physically active .
in combination with a cut @-@ cut program to support the weight loss , you can help you create a heal@@ th@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as Chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional application of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a medicine which can be used as Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the drug prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , on the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received Chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in Chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
in Chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are shown to 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ) .
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe waste disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid in front of chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ o@@ dar@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ taining or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection m@@ asch@@ al can be monitored .
however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advis@@ able to extend p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended , or tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor for prevention , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not inhib@@ it the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ equi@@ p concentration or@@ ic met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itors .
in one population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hib@@ itors , D@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant impact on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie before , hence , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless prescribed by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
in clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency ranges from undes@@ irable events were observed like in other dos@@ ages . there were no dose of action to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who were randomised to treat patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 1 hour ) , which was reduced to day 1 without the exam@@ ines .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cyc@@ lo@@ phosphate and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , which were random@@ ized on Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the primary and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered in single doses ranging from 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma centr@@ alized , a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal half time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 m g / kg .
after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses that was measured at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ oma patients ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma center at 42 ± 34 % .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations produced a total exposure of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , with after one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was increased from 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation showed that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after an unique intraven@@ ous wr@@ ong@@ ation in Ges@@ hur@@ ry , the total full @-@ body weight 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
indeed , in patients with severe liver function inter@@ rupt the terminal elim@@ ination , and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , however , reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are seen as sufficient above the maximum human exposure exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance to clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical studies showed indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be pro@@ long in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose may be given in approximately the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ op@@ last@@ y ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary ) and skin tum@@ ours by rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi is intended for human being used , the relev@@ ance of this results were considered for human beings .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative approval in which the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should become a biological medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A , associated with the same practices , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference guide &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hepatitis C ( a caused by a virus infection .
during a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation the liver tissue has increased damage , also the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood pressure standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was incorporated into the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturers of Alph@@ eon showed data that demonstrate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active ingredient , composition and purity of the drug , operation , safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C the efficacy of alph@@ abet was compared with the effectiveness of the reference guide to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured , as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in blood ) .

furthermore , concerns are expressed , that the data on the stability of the active substance and the market@@ able drug may not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which occurred on treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up more patients than in reference tests ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used in the study to test the question , however , the drug con@@ forms an immune response ( i.e. , the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ bles ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ ater ) , sh@@ uts and par@@ ked w@@ ounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ seed Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go could not affect these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years , the treatment area cannot be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the physician should examine the patient again and draw alternative treatments in consideration .
it works by blocking the bacterial Rib@@ os@@ ome ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and inhib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the major indic@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was canc@@ eled after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients on placebo and placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin cells , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies at Hau@@ tw@@ ater were taken together , they said about 90 % of patients in both groups .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was diagnosed with the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( over@@ crow@@ ded hol@@ low in the body tissue ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) is a reduction in the order .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go at short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , ra@@ dic@@ ed or inclined w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who show no improvement in two to three days , should be considered once and an alternative therapy must be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation caused by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy can be begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which M@@ RSA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary studies , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be taken into account if a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma centr@@ alized , which were achieved in humans following top@@ ical application , a clin@@ ically relevant inhib@@ ition in vivo are not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After con@@ vivi@@ al treatment of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment on the chopped skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ age adjustments are not required for treatment when top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to oral dosage and are in@@ adequate for a statement on the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibio@@ tic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ate or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / termin@@ ate it is between the benefit of the n@@ ursing inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have used Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side effects on the administration site that consider about 1 % of the patients .
operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhib@@ ition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction in a specific binding place of the 50s by the bacterial Rib@@ os@@ ome , which differs from other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
the data indicates that the Bin@@ ding station ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ bond and the Pep@@ tide @-@ transfer@@ ing centre .
by binding on this binding place inhib@@ it P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhib@@ it the pep@@ tide @-@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be conc@@ ei@@ vable at least some of the infections should be consult@@ ed by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the Isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to treat the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional viral factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ ine ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on int@@ act and applied for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of phy@@ tom@@ atic w@@ ounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
rehear@@ s@@ ation took place in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each of the medi@@ ation and in the children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption of people after top@@ ical application was reduced by 1 % sal@@ ts to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhib@@ ition .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was primarily used by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there was no male nor with female rats from reduced fer@@ til@@ icity of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby att@@ ained up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) was s@@ worn by skin :
in an embryo study on rats were detected at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to a ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development pol@@ arity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which affect the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the context of two doses existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when the immun@@ isation is an inf@@ low risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensured that the vaccination can be caused by two doses .
if an accumulation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine is given .
vacc@@ ines do , by supporting the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; how it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detect viruses and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine vaccine grown in 1996 and the vaccine has been approved by the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered in the context of three doses existing vaccination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ an for the efficacy was the proportion of ger@@ min@@ ated children who had developed a month after the last inj@@ ections a protective antibody .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B during the last injection .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Ambi@@ rix degree in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appeti@@ te , pain in the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernal ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react to patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic reactions ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a licence for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ eri@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered in the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if an accumulation is w@@ ished for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) inhib@@ itor of anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) inhib@@ itor values range in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully secured , whether immune @-@ competent individuals who need on a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination is required , because they may also be protected from immune memory through the immune memory .
3 As for all injection @-@ materials used in the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic response , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended for hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B virus .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is achieved so that in these cases , the gift of additional vaccination doses can be required .
since in@@ tra @-@ narrow injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular administration may lead to a sub@@ optimum impedance , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , when Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ yc@@ t@@ open@@ ia or ble@@ eding problems , Ambi@@ rix can inj@@ ected with@@ drawn sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections since it can occur in these cases in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular gift to ble@@ eding .
when ambi@@ tion was administered in the second year of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b vaccine was given to the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may not be sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernal , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable with the pre@@ valence that was observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ ate and preser@@ vative vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines ambi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years the ambi@@ tion of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans of combination sim@@ ulations .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ eness on a calculation basis per vaccination basis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects in accordance with the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination sim@@ ulations .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects had received 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination of combination .
however , the frequency of Matcha was similar to high ( i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , Ambi@@ rix were compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the test subjects , which received the 3 @-@ cans combination of combination ) .
the pre@@ valence of lower pain and mat@@ ernal mortality was low and comparable , which was observed after administration of the combination @-@ sim@@ ul@@ ant with the 3 @-@ cans vaccination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- until 11 year old vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reaction and general interactions was comparable to hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus .
however , during the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines with a 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ Virus was statistically not different .
in clinical studies that were conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were given a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered ( in the month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered ( in the month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study which was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations used with three doses .
for the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was in@@ valuable , the serum levels ( SP in the table below ) was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose reg@@ ains significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- until 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
for people who were at the time of the prim@@ dim@@ eri@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ antibodies and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected through a minimum of 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccination scheme .
the immun@@ o@@ deficiency observed in this study was similar to both anti@@ gens being comparable to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combination , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme is similar to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccination scheme .
if the first dose ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the accumulation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b @-@ vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps in vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this present formulation was conducted for the present formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for former formulation .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred through viral rep@@ ell@@ ant foods and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as swimming in water @-@ contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , an in@@ dul@@ gen@@ al face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ low@@ ish ) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protecting against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you have not been infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you feel / your child can &apos;t feel un@@ comfortable or sick / feel ) a disease may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be communicated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ ck@@ ling skin attacks , breath or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if you have played an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you wish to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prior appointment of the second vaccination dose ) .
during a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the physician will betra@@ y you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ ence .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine , with a reduced content of inver@@ teb@@ rates per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine is administered at a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection against the vaccination series .
sometimes ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who are inj@@ ected to severe blood cl@@ ots , if you are weak@@ ened to the skin and not into the muscle tissue , or if you / your child is under@@ going to under@@ go a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can be in@@ sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is required .
21 Speak to your doctor , if you have taken your child or take another medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ptions ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated / or Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given or this is planned in the near future .
it may be , however , in that case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
when a vaccine is given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , ambi@@ tion is not administered to pregnant women or l@@ act@@ ating women except for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B will be vacc@@ inated .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibio@@ tic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination date , talk with your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 se@@ ated doses ) : • pain or complaints at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Fe@@ asi@@ bility • In@@ t@@ ability • Head of appeti@@ te

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been announced since issu@@ ing the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP revealed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix positive .
since Ambi@@ rix is only allowed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with an in@@ complete enzyme ( brain compensation for a high degree of ammonia concentrations ) in the history of history .
ammon@@ ium is divided into several single boxes - split , under food mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall in the gast@@ ric tube ) or a nose sun ( through the nose into the gast@@ ric tube ) .
it was no comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps don &apos;t work with another treatment or placebo ( a pseud@@ o @-@ medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also cause appeti@@ te loss , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , t@@ ooth@@ ache , fl@@ ushing , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nau@@ sea , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle was effectively avo@@ ids .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug templates .
the application is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme has already manifested in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( complete enzyme def@@ ective , which is manifested after the first life of life ) , there is an indication of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese form a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite encephalopath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not capable of swal@@ lowed tablets or for patients with hat@@ ching disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually prescribed under consideration of protein toler@@ ability and for the growth and development of daily protein intake of the patients .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny b@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hat@@ ching problems , as a risk of the emer@@ gence of est@@ u@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if tablets can &apos;t get away immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and dem@@ entia use only with caution .
as Met@@ abol@@ ization and elim@@ ination of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate about liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal contamination and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed friction of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be detected whether Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced when human breast milk is di@@ vor@@ ced , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events were assumed that they were not combined with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ tic patient , which developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a accid@@ ental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are used with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ si@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ otox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a metab@@ oli@@ zed connection with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is di@@ vor@@ ced through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the capture of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed to be produced for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the prog@@ nosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ lic@@ as , and the disease has led to death for Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free anal@@ ogues in the first year of life .
due to hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of the nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids ( however , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born ) in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of living ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was treated with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ proof form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ int@@ ran@@ ny @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine ble@@ eding according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites became also studied with cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking an interval of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cyc@@ lic distur@@ ban@@ ces or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was present in the plasma next morning .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , were five times higher than after the first gifts .
this medication is di@@ vor@@ ced within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no anti @-@ toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at will be taken either oral ( inf@@ ant and children who can &apos;t have no tablets , or patients with hat@@ ch distur@@ ban@@ ces ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nose son@@ en .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ant and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum samples in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny b@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ alism was suspended before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of brain cells .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ tic patient , which developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that every gram of genom@@ ic sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ amin can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ules , 15 minutes after taking an average plasma cent@@ ric center of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
at this moment the small measuring spoon contains 0.0@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon is 2.9 g and the big measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ch is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can accum@@ ulate the metabolism of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory tests you need to inform the doctor , that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation , you can not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine can go over to the milk and h@@ urt your baby .
in rare inst@@ ances , tur@@ t@@ ness , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , cause of hearing , des@@ ori@@ enti@@ ous disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or with a emergency response to your hospital for introduction to a corresponding treatment .
if you forget the dosage of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , please take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

30 If you have conducted laboratory tests you need to tell the doctor , that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed to equal single doses of oral or via a Mag@@ enf@@ ist@@ le ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose son@@ en ( tube , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring sc@@ oop of Gran@@ ules . • St@@ range of straight edge , e.g. to remove a knife edge , e.g. a measuring spoon . • En@@ joy the recommended amount of measuring sc@@ oop of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute corpor@@ al syndrome &quot; ( ACS ) , for instance at un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ ograph or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ os@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who use one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can enhance patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack for maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at all of the treatment of angi@@ ogen@@ esis or in combination with a glyc@@ op@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and GP@@ I was compared .
while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a clas@@ p ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was angi@@ os@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - to prevent new events ( deaths , heart attacks or revol@@ ving ) after 30 days or a year , as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indicators as effectively as Hep@@ arin , except for severe blood vessels , where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ os@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ins , or one of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who had a blood pressure , as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to provide approval for the placing on the market of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency use or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ als of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out using a PCI option , an additional Bol@@ us should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure is given an increase of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ os@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cell release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the security and effectiveness of a general Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ment is planned .
if this value is shortened to 225 seconds ( ACT ) , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened to 225 seconds .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tionally and dil@@ uted medicines should be mixed carefully and quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is treated with one PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS is treated or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose .
patients with moderate kidney compensation , which included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which included in the approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous treatment of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous Hep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active blood circulation or increased blood risk disorders . • serious un@@ controlled hypertension and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti @-@ an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if using PCI patients suffering from bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most blood cells occur in patients who can under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment with a per@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be drawn to monitoring the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) in order to ensure that the value after setting up the treatment with bi@@ val@@ esc@@ ud@@ in again reached the treatment existing before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the reaction of an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ yc@@ ten@@ ants ) , the active ingredients can increase blood pressure .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ yc@@ ten@@ ants or an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atics parameters are regularly insp@@ ected in any case .
the experimental studies are in@@ sufficient for pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ sufficient development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hib@@ itor and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hib@@ itor .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group and in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin , there was more often than 65 years more common to undes@@ irable occasions than in male or younger patients .
severe blood vessels were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ eding , as defined in Table 2 .
both lightweight and heavy ble@@ edings were significantly fewer than in groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhib@@ itor and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhib@@ itor ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ i@@ elle , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding , hem@@ atology with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ alis@@ ations caused by more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , ear , nose and neck .
the following information on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ esc@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Group as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin , there came more often than 65 years more frequently than undes@@ irable occasions than in male or younger patients .
both lightweight and heavy ble@@ edings were significantly fewer than in the comparison group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhib@@ itor .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were summar@@ ised according to comprehensive application in practice and are summar@@ ised in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosage , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ders should be canc@@ eled immediately and to monitor the patient in terms of signs of ble@@ eding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhib@@ itor , which is located in the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the an@@ ion@@ en@@ binary region of thro@@ mb@@ in bin@@ ds , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ led the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was caused by bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in serum samples in which it had come to hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ yc@@ t@@ open@@ ie / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ al Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ c@@ yte aggreg@@ ate reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is showing a dose @-@ dependent anti @-@ inflammatory effect , which is assigned by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if in the patient was performed using a PCI option , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ range ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hib@@ itor either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
the AC@@ U@@ ITY study were the characteristics of high @-@ risk experiments that required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , even@@ ly over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had an recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiovascular biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ go a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or as continuous in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease based on the body not sufficient ins@@ ulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or process ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very mar@@ gin@@ ally from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter minimum of activity has become a short @-@ acting human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in use in combination with type 1 diabetes in combination with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was detected in comparison with a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin p@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentrations was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal in@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect the blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to publish A@@ pi@@ dra for placing A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either applying sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose capacities and the di@@ min@@ ished ins@@ ulin @-@ change , the ins@@ ulin requirement may be reduced to patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may pull a change in the ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or the breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ type diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ; these states are potentially explosive threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin is required under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin @-@ used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change with changing the treatment schem@@ as .
the substances that increase blood sugar activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis cells , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ op@@ ene @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ics , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ees can be sh@@ ak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if ins@@ ulin is over@@ coming into human breast milk , but in general , ins@@ ulin is not res@@ or@@ ated in breast milk , nor is being res@@ or@@ ated after oral use .
herein@@ after referred to in clinical trials , those from clinical studies are listed , group@@ ed according to system organic classes , and frequently : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1.000 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .

severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis with inj@@ us@@ el@@ ess@@ ness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is treated by a doctor , or treated by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ ist injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ality of the severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar epis@@ odes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels through stim@@ ulating peripheral glucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhib@@ iting glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ a- be of ins@@ ulin delivery times faster and the activity time shorter is shorter than in hu@@ d normal normal in@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ oss T@@ US showed an ins@@ ulin @-@ relevant met@@ ering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase of glu@@ ing effects , precisely like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double @-@ fast effectiveness as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieved the complete glu@@ ing effect around 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was obvious that during an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post @-@ ran@@ ged gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human@@ ly normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was ge@@ aring , was reached a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control than with human@@ kind Normal ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is turned , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as in the normal normal rate ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal in@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 20 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
