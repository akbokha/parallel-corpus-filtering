<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Review Report (EPAR), which will be explained as the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please consult the treatment instructions (also part of EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in mouth) as a solution for inclusion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and spreadsheets, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), misstrust and imaginations; • Bipolar-I-disturbance, a psychic illness associated with the patients of manic episodes (periodic tower) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased uncertainty or behavioral disturbance when oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used to insert or processed the melting tablets in patients who prepare the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who use other medicines, the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably known primarily as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role, wearing Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manical symptoms and restarting it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, re-initiating symptoms, has been investigated in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that were stabilized at 160 patients, where the manical symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, altering symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who studied on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also conducted studies in order to investigate the melting of the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies using the injection solution patients, Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify, in four of five short-term studies, manic symptoms effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks as placebo the reinstances of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), vmor (continuous movement), dilution, nausea (dilution), tiredness, exhaustion (increased saliva), tiredness and exhaustion, restlessness, Insomnie (insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and medium-heavy episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared with risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased uncertainty and patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if a oral treatment is not suitable for risks associated with risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- Disorder and for prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">When the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to the psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder caused an increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (cardiac insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular disorders (dehydration, hypoallergies, treatment with blood pressure detergents) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which one year or less continued, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinism should occur, should reduce the dose or canceling the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient understands signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with crammed cases in the anamnese or at random cases, which may be treated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response of unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, extremely and associated with ketoazia or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic active substances, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events involving ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is observed as a side effect, or lead to serious complications, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution must be careful when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs like sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, reduces resorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">When CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma center of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should benefit the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasers, should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dossier before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with ABILIFY, a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole a day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C9 (warfarin) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant while treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data protection for human beings, and due to the inproductive studies in the animal, this medicine must not be used in pregnancy, unless the possible benefits justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they're safe that Aripiprazole has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) as under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequencies specified below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% was used in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was used in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was used for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In addition to the side effects that may occur in connection with a antipsychotic therapy, the malignne neuroleptic syndrome, spasdyskinesia and cramp circles, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberately acute overdosage with Aripiprazole has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis in treatment of an overdosage with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemalysis in treatment is an overdose of benefit from Aripiprazole a high plasma scrap.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder occurs on the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine d2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptor receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine d4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenees and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Posity.Emissions Tomography showed a dosisdependable decreasing of binding 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of the response of the patients who remained a response to study mediation in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messskal, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Deprestion rates shown, showed a significantly stronger improvement when Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and the primary study target 'weight gain, stood under Aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of outstandable patients) of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bipolar-I interruption, Aripiprazole showed placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazole to placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a shift effect compared with placebo or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole in week 12 had a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie to as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of mantra symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase, with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazole showed considering the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in preventing the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a return into Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxyfusion of Aripiprazole, which is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal duration is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with Extensive Metabolisers about CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolites about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients were not sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popularity analysis for pharmacokinetics showed no reference to clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking in the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency in comparison with young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the influence of the liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to withdraw from the metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety immunology, toxicity with repeated treatment, reproductive toxicity, mycotoxins and kanectic potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any particular hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects include a dossire-dependent side rind rind-toxicity (CRC) at 20 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-10mg / kg / day (corresponds to 10 mg / kg / day) during female steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelieliasis was found as a result of the discharge of sulphate-conjugate of Aripiprazole in the Gall of monkeys according to repeated oral treatment of 25-125 mg / kg / day (1-3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of sulphate-conjugate concentrations were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate-conjugate concentrations, which were found in the study about 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">During rabbits these effects were observed after dosages which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the conspicuous important hematological toxicity (with 79% of the patient reported) and was rapidly reversible and dossier was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed with 46% of patients who were treated with Abraxane was observed in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects described in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane could be performed as a monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); sometimes (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased Laktatdehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysentery, steels, affection, dry mouth, smoothed gums, loose food, eye catagitis, pain in the mouth, oral pain, rectal hemorrhages of kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest, weakness, musculature, diarrhea, muscle pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, pain pain, discomfort in goose, muscle weakens Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity is based on a final case related to a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no heralous connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a Antimicrotubuli substance that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubes and stabilizes the microtubules through inhibiting its depression.</seg>
<seg id="303">Stabilisation leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of microtubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin has been mediated in the Transcytosis of Plasmakoma in the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of Albumin's transportation by Paclitaxel is supported by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendotheliale transport is mediated by the gp-60-Albuminrereceptor and due to the albumen SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two unapproachable studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane that was given in the form of infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received 3 weeks a monotherapy with Paclitaxel, either in the form of solvent containing allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a common condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metaliasestellen.</seg>
<seg id="311">In previously, 14% of patients had no chemotherapy alone, 27% had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% because of metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9. the results for general response rate and time until progression-free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-Line therapy, are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 in the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural history of peripheral neuropathy to be applied to baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The effect of active exposure (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel-plasmakereal increased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or consecration bond of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced sound tumours, pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 17mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) than after a solvent-containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microphones and tissues, Paclitaxel is reported to metabolized - hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the average total dose for cumulative alcohol was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="361">Treatment with seperamed must be directed under the supervision of a doctor, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which is indicated for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or caregiver or caregiver, provided an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobster values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter to adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to control in order to ensure that no iron deficiency could be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy alone, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinmangel, or thereby, the body does not affect the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene (DNA) that it is capable of formation of epoxy alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the injection into a Vene in the context of a main study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by reference to reference problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks in Eprex / Erypo in a vene, before they were either injected or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobal values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of speckled Abseamed were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study, patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the haemoglobal values were killed in the same size as for those patients who continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common minor effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, the occasionally to symptoms of a encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steching migraine and perseverity.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against epectin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injection under skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, since further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the medicine has been provided for Abseamed according to the requirements of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed, will provide information on medical professionals in all Member States, including information about the safety of pharmaceuticals.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anämiesymptome and follicences can be different depending on age, gender and total disease last; therefore the assessment of individual clinical waste and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) should be avoided during a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobins can be observed in either patient or under the hemoglobination concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Due to these hemoglobinaries, the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) should be reached by 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemulator is increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the durable hemoglobinder exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epectin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored in order to ensure that epoxy-alfa is in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anaesnymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher production doses (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &lt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored in order to ensure that epectin alfa is in the lowest permitted dose which is required for control of antiviral symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobal value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reproduction percentage has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 i.e / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobins rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reproduction percentage of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 i.e / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">If the hemoglobal value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reproduction percentage of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, is an appeal to the epectin-alfa therapy unlikely and treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the caring storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is needed, should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before operative intervention.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example, a few weeks prior to the beginning of the autologous blood donkey program - which began before the beginning of the seashamed therapy large iron reserves are available.</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study were randomised to 508 men and evaluated in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fragile in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated males in comparison to 8.7% when placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta relative to the percentage change from alendronat was related to the percentage change of Lendensibel-BMD after 24 months in comparison to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically proven moring of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2,6fold up to 3,0times age-specific upper normal value at inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day during 2 months was detected in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results after 6 months, a similar decrease of pain strength and pain may be observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as response of the six-month main study on the response (on the therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Out of 143 with Aclasta and 107 with acedronate treated patients who were treated at the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach could be achieved with 71 of the patients with acedronate, compared with 71 percent of the mean follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosistically independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma bricks rapidly increased from &lt; 10% to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) probably represent the quick resorption in the bones and excretion on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the suggested dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound on bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The whole body clearing is independent from the dose of 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race, or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledronacid concentrations by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmaconentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450-Enzymsysteme is unlikely to metabolized - because Zoledroneic acid is not metabolized - because it is a weak or even a direct and / or irreversibly dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was in the average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive kidney function interference up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney function (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted data are possible, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest unrivalled intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended human therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined to obtain a total of 6-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, total 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to 7x 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to 7x of the human therapeutic exposure, relative to AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>

<seg id="750">Account is applied to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can't be used in patients (especially overweight treatment). • It can be applied together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest possible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphide hard foam or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphide is maintained and insulin with the beginning of acetlycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphur resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body is better to be utilised and reduced blood sugar, thereby reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acetate in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphide in addition, they received either acetate or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration of a substance in blood (glycerylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">The account led to a lowering of the HbA1c value that reduces blood sugar levels in use of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the plea therapy study, the effect of acetate treatment of acetate and a sulfonyl alcohol showed a reduction of the HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional application of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acetate and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, patients receiving acetate A1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0,14% in patients receiving placebo and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with acettos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract infections (pathogens), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not react to patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoazia (high level of level - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard therapy with metformin in patients, in which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for marketing of marketing to marketing to the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, hence the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should begin to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced karst reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and eye levels when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced spotrovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developed symptoms such as unsolved nausea, vomiting, colonisation problems, tiredness, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzyme values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient's treatment is continued with Pioglitazon, should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dosisdependable weight gain was detected, which can stir in fatty deposits and in some cases with a fluid failure.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemelution, under the therapy with Pioglitazon, a reduced reduction of medium hemoglobinds (relative reduction by 4%) and hematrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies using Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-2% and hematrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who received Pioglitazon as oral dual-combination therapy with insulin or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosistive hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, with thiazolidindia, Pioglitazone, including Pioglitazon, reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, however, the possibility of a macular edema must be aware of the possibility of a macular edema; an appropriate ophthalmological clarification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events concerning bone breaks, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fragments per 100 patients with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive Study, a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascularious events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient has a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on interactions have shown that Pioglitazon do not have relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, Cyclosporin, calcium inhibitor and HMGCoA reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the womb and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the Federal Cultural's growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the fractions of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents appeared beyond the triple the upper limit of the standard range similar to placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced spotrovascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely has been reported using congestive sufficiency under Pioglitazon, more frequently when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with insufficiency in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of notifications were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with reference mediation treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of over a period of 3,5 years, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparable mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking a total dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day spent seven days and no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears on a activation of specific nuclear receptor inhibitor (PPAR g g), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, grease and skeletal musculine cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose recovery in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were insufficient in spite of three months, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to have insulin-treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year there was a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin Quotides compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week investigation on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction of the total plasma-glyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was detected in Pioglitazon no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under Metformin and Gliclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride level, but improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride mirror, which is based on a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to hepatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive Study, a cardiovascular study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced desrovascular disease in groups that have been treated with either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is resorated quickly, with the top concentrations of unchangeable Pioglitazone in the plasma is usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution from M-IV is equivalent to the efficacy of the efficiency of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon could not have any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma centric of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive Pioglitazone in humans the marker was mainly found in the Mittens (55%) and a lower extent of the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazon amounts to humans 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centric of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the instalments of oral clearing is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkey coincided with repealing Plasmavolume magnification with hemelution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardial hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the womb and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the Federal Cultural's growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased intratendencies of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urinary bladder.</seg>

<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either Pioglitazon or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year there was a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin Quotides compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride level, but improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride mirror, which has a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryginal synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft has already been deployed in the EU, the company presented the results from previously carried out studies using Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The results of a clinical study was presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Main indian of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was discharged after a treatment duration of one year (by example, how often a renewed organ transplant or a re-intake of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, further studies were performed on 119 patients suffering from kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and investigated how Advance is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tactile antibiotics (such as Erythromycin) or one of the other components, Advagraf cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors have to be careful when others (especially some herbal) medicines can be taken at the same time with Advagraf, as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Hard capsules, retarded yellow-orange gels, printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule with "0.5 mg" and on the orange capsule with "'647"; they contain white powder.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuressive therapy and treatment of transplantation patients should be classified or make changes in immunosuressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to transplants or increased incidence of side effects, including sub-immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always retain the same tacit formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; reorders of formulation or regime should only be performed under narrow inspection of one in transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosissions must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The Dosage dosage should be based on clinical assessment of degradation and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-reflective terms (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograve on Advagraf, the Tacrolimus dam should be controlled from the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as valley mirror, was comparable with both formulations for kidney transplants as well as lebertransplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of Tacrolimus-Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate gratenment phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, an adaptation of the Advagraf Dosage schemas can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition is not allowed in the first postoperative period, the Tacrolimus treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for making an infusion solution) using a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application to suppression of transplantation must be maintained; consequently, the immunosuppression must not be specified, consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft transplantation The orale deagraf therapy should begin with 0,20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily operation in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosages can be later required since the Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of graft transplantation The orale deagraf therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as once daily operation in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - changeover from Prograve on Advagraf must be switched on twice daily dosage of profoundf to once daily taking from Advagraf to take this change in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose to take place.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after a switch from other immunosuressiva to Advagraf once daily the treatment with the recommended initials recommended for prophylaxis of graft transplantation must begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to Advagraf is an oral initials of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplants, although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankreas- and darkened patients were used in an oral initials of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day and for rectal transplantation in an oral initials of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for rectal transplantation in an oral initials of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain Bluttalmirror in the targeted area may be required for patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no effect on pharmaceutical inetics of tacroplimus, may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels and monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf in the conversion from a Ciclosporin on a tactile-based therapy is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in the whole blood is the first line on clinical assessment of demolition and tolerability in individual waste under assistance of whole blood-Tacrolimus-Talsi controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talks while the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talks of Tacrolimus should also change after conversion from Prograve on Advagraf, Dosage adjustments, changes to immunosuressive therapy or at simultaneous application of substances that could be controlled (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, the dose may require several days, until the steady state came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Talks not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley of Tacrolimus lies in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with hearted transplants at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft transplants or other side effects, which can occur in a result of tactics or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always retain the same tacit formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; reorders of formulation or regime should only be performed under narrow inspection of one in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplants, which proved to be other immunosudepressants, not yet clinical data for retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">The prophylaxis of transplantation in adult heart transplants and transplantation received no clinical data for retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interaction, which may lead to a coating of the tactile mirror in the blood and a weaker of clinical effects of tacrolimus, is the intake of herbal supplements that include currant herbs (hypericum perforation), or avoid other plant-related agents during treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of Tacrolimus concentrations in blood because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subjected to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, aqueous humor or septic hypertrophies was observed in rare cases, which therefore may also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of clinical disturbances, are an existing heart-suffering, treatment with cortiosteroids, hypertension or liver function, infections, liquid overburden and estrogen.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like other immunosuressiva, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner, due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who use Tacrolimus, symptoms of pres such as headache, changed levels of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radical study (eg.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advices contain hard capsules, lactose, lactose is included in patients with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-Galactose-Malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels in concurrent treatment of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly influenced interaction with antimonks such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteasants (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly result from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to inhibiting the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly automated prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute abbing reactions, can increase the concentration of tacroplimus in blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacroplimus with medicines being metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus minimise the Clearance of Steroid contrasts and so that hormone exposure may increase, especially cautiously by decisions of receiving measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experimentation have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially decrease the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations on transplantation patients provide no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuressiva, an increased risk of unwanted events, with regard to the course and earnings of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborns is recommended to potential adverse effects of Tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It has reported about benign or malicious neoplasty including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and rhints in combination with tacroplimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysing.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tactics and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level can be mediated by its binding on a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment in the cellars.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciredependent inhibition of signal transmission paths in T cells and thus prevents transcription of a certain range of lymphockin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in Tacrointestinal and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, there came to 21,7% of cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% at Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin was converted to tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplantation, was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lunges-treated patients of Tacrolimus Group larger (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the frequency of the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms in patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-centric study conducted with oral care was conducted at 205 patients who simultaneously received treatment of pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which received a randomised procedure of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by Protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then to reach the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplants The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf showed primary transplantation in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multivisceral transplants) of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marker thicknesses, additional gift of interleukin-2 antagonists, lead to Talrolimus (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocycloid and low protein concentrations, which led to an increase in the uncertain faction of Tacrolimus, or through treatment with cortiostal eroids are to be responsible for transplantation observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can be done that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized - whereby the exits is mainly done via the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who were converted by Prograf (twice a day) at Advagraf (once daily) at the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was lower than under Prograve for nearly 10% lower than Prograve.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talks while the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplants, which proved to be other immunosudepressants, not yet clinical data for retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for treatment and prevention of hemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (a lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotation) are used.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application is after that Advate is used for treating blood cancers or the prevention of hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack of blood problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method used as "recombinant DNA."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene (DNA) that it is capable of forming the human tinner factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar in the European Union of approved medicinal products called Recombinate, but it is made different, so that the medicine does not contain proteins and animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study of 53 children under six years, the application of pharmaceuticals was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advata was awarded with "excellent" and "good" for prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510%.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to bring an approval for the placing of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dose and duration of the substitutive therapy is based on the severity of factor VIII-defect, after the place and the degree of blood and clinical status of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">The following hillor rhagic events shall not sink the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period specified under the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in i.e / dl).</seg>

<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is present for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment process, the dose and frequency of injections stimulated the appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and different semi-ties.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis found in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be achieved or when blood is controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that factor VIII therapy must not be effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The formulation is to be found after finding the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always quantified against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG Immunglobuline that quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is related within the first 20 consecutive exposure days at the biggest and genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitors, after conversion of a recombinant factor VIII to another, the reoccurrence of (lowest) inhibitors is observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Inhibitors of ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) which have previously untreated patients who have higher risk for formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the approval of available data, the CHMP has continued to be considered positive, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURS every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder must apply another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited published the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) officially announced that the company takes his application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the wheat parts (tissues, which combines other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "with the virus in Advexin, it is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which was so altered that there will be no copies of themselves and cannot remove any infections in human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">In the tumours, Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and to form the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein, which is formed from the non defective in human body, normally contributes to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni's Cancer at which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein works correctly, and the cancer cells continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put up data from a study with one patient, at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of construction, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP reviewed the company's answers to the asked questions, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on testing the documents submitted, CHMP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent by the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors will bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee had further concerns relating to the processing of pharmaceuticals in the body, the method of administration and safety of pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advances can be produced in reliable mode, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't know the CHMP, whether the withdrawal have consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified substance release" "" "means that tablets are thus composed so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeropaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic tendencies (hay fever) caused by a allergy against pollen (nasal infections) in patients with nose mucous swelling (hidden noses).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (peted nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drug may be left to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the Heuschnupfymptome that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated by a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrites symptoms, in addition to the constipation of the nose, patients who revenues aeropaze reported by a decrease of symptoms by 46.0% compared with 35,9% in the patients who alone was contracted by pseudo-ephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aeropaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (cardiac disease), constipation, dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, fatigue, insomniotic (insomnia), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropaze may not be insensitive to patients suffering from desloratadine, pseudo-ephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenerous substances or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also not be used in patients that suffer from a bottlenangle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension) or haemorrhagic stroke (caused by brain circulation) or have a risk for haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe to provide approval for the marketing of aeronautics in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is too swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to break, break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the error of data for inconceivable and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">Duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after clinical symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because at long time application the activity of Pseudoephedrin can be cancelled with the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with proloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudodephedrin with other vasoconstricter such as bromocripitin, ergotamine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, oxychazolin, Napdyolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked and the data are not sufficient to send corresponding recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and the efficacy of aeropaze were not checked in patients suffering from kidney or liver function and do not submit the data to express appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed about the treatment of hypertension or tachycarriages, heart rhythm disturbances, nausea or etwaig other neurological symptoms (such as headache, or a gain of headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment of following patients "patients are recommended to be careful: • Patients with a heart rhythm disturbances • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospassports in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, as Antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition to clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma centric of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">There were no significant differences between the patients suffering from Desloratadin and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether proloratadine alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzymes responsible for metabolism of desloratadine enzyme has not been identified so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate for the P-glycoprotone is not inhibited.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The infertility of the application of aeropaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences of a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the prevalence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and cannot be applied to vasoconstriical properties of pseudo-ephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases to a drowsiness, which can lead to an impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collise) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, convulsions).</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, staggering micro-tion, muscle weaknesses and increased muscular stress, euphoria, arousal disturbances, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxy, tendous disorders, hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely to be, as well as atropin typical symptoms (mouth-dry, Pupillenadire and - Dilatation, Hautration, Hyperthermia and gastrointestinal Symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophilen as well as inhibition of expression of the adjuvant P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables including the reinforcement of subjective punches or tasks that are connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of rainfall was observed in comparison to placebo during the recommended dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause more sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykardie or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic tenitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamine antagonist efficacy of aeropaze tablets were determined based on the overall score for symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Pseudoephedrin on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aeropaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aeropaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aeropaze, desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrin was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier study that was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin was bad.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was the exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety immunology, toxicity with repeated treatment, for mycotoxicity and reproduction, the pre-clinical data with proloratadine does not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive neurosurgery studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup and respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergic tendencies and two studies on patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and magnitude of squares, impairment of sleep and the performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to verify that the body utilises the syrup, the solution for inserting and melting tablets in the same way, how the tablets and the application are harmless in children.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Based on allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies have been compiled, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius were caused by an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to a reduction of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe to provide approval for the marketing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and Persian Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadin for adolescents aged between 12 and 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of an anti-hypoallergienrhinitis (symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to the previous post-clinical symptoms and may be resumed with their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persist allergic tendencies (symptoms of symptoms on 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended during a lasting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given in addition (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, treatment of Aerius and alcohol was not enhanced by alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients, however, should be clarified that it may occur in very rare cases of dizziness, which can lead to an impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius when they were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently occurring side effects, on which more commonly referred to placebo was fatigue (1,2%), dialogs (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years the most common cause of headache, this occurred at 5.9% of the patients who were treated with Desloratadin and treated with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study where up to 45 mg desloratadin (neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophilen as well as inhibition of expression of the adjuvant P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple boxes, in the desloratadin, in a dose of up to 20 mg had been administered every 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant carabovasculular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin, in a dose of 45 mg daily (the non-fold the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dossi- study involving adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables including the reinforcement of subjective punches or tasks that are connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensection, and itching of the nose, itching, lacricane and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis, and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persist allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown using the overall positive rate of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the grazing loads caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of Urtikaria, because the underlying pathophysiology considers the edicology of different forms, and chronic patients can be simulated.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine faced by a significant factor in all urtikarial diseases, desloratadin is expressed in other forms of the Urtikaria in addition to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose-intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who didn't react to antihistamine, out of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the serum concentration of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients with Desloratadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and juniper, as determined by a 4-point scale to evaluate those variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which were comparable to patients-Demographical Rhinitis population, 4% of patients had reached a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no connection points for clinical-relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals cannot be excluded completely</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo no CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate for the P-glycoprotone is not inhibited.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fetch, calorie rich breakfast) is not included in the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials conducted by Desloratadin and Loratadin showed a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, not qualitative or quantitative differences in desloratadine and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety immunology, toxicity with repeated treatment, mycotoxins and reproduction, the pre-clinical data with proloratadin do not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains hyper melt, Macrogol 400), Carneckawax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergy Rhinitis) and urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see below section 4.4) and that no data suggest that treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory failure or anatomical anomalies, in case of diagnosis the Anamnese, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and cutouts should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolized - disintegration (see below section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The security of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized - is identical to the children that are normally metabolized -</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose Galactose-absorption, or a Saccharase-Isomaltas- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given in addition (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, treatment of Aerius tablets and alcohol was not amplified without alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total number of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">During a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (neunfold clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11, who came to question an antihistamine treatment, received a daily desloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, can extrapolate the efficacy data from desloratadin in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Within a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin, in a dose of up to 20 mg had been applied daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant carabovasculular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin, in the desloratadine was applied for more than ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, during the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, increased frequency of rainfall was observed in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical studies, not any impairment of psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies on adults it occurred either by simultaneous use of alcohol neither to a amplification of alcohol-induced performance impairs to an increase of rainfall.</seg>
<seg id="1781">For adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensection, and itching of the nose, itching, lacricane and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown using the overall positive rate of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively emphasized the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose-intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolized phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucaine (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, observed in restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 to 6 hours after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax is approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no connection points for a clinically relevant drug-cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In different single dose studies, AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals cannot be excluded completely.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and older people for protection against flu, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a tribe of influenza, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Grippepandemie breaks out when a new tribe of Grippevirus retched by man, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of vaccines, the immune system recognises the parts of influenza in the vaccine as "physical alien."</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form an flu by Grippevirus this ancestor faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface anti-membranes" (proteins on membranes, which detect the human body as body-foreign), was isolated and used as an integral part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Some of the study sites showed that the study had not been carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteasing.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low-dose Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase has been compared with 206 adults who were compared with other protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indian for efficacy was the proportion of patients with detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who previously did not have a proteasants, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virus load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the virusload, however, of the children who had been treated with proteasers only very few in the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgeneric in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protectors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for the application for children under 4 years, due to the error of data for inconceivable and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data the dose to agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions increased to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that own a low therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, which include Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation), may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma centralized and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ammavir during taking amacavir (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucotheorids that can be confused via CYP3A4, it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic corneal eroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the annex function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reduction-inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of asastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenytobital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International normalised ratio), are available to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be effective for reduced plasma levels of amplitude (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amdetavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contrasts can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When Methadone is given simultaneously with Amdetavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatentanglers, especially if there are even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity because of the high propyl carccoli solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received a antiretroviral therapy including proteasing inhibitor, hyperglycemia or an extraction of diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>

<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with severe immunodefective, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections can develop, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial field is assumed (including application of Kortikosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuregression, higher Body-Mass-Index), reported cases of osteonekrose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of a antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given simultaneously with medicines that own a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be used together with medicines whose ingredients are mainly confused via CYP2D6 and for increased plasma levels with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ammavir, which can lead to an anti-rological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by a dose-increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir have been observed very often unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Caricum perforation (hypericum perforation) The serum levels of Ammavir can be decreased by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with currant herbs (hypericum perforation).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already occupies Johanniskraut, the Amroavirons are, and, if possible, to review the virusload and add the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amdetavir (see also Eavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered twice a day in combination with Amravioli capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, dosages of 600 mg of Ammavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily that demonstrate the effectiveness and effectiveness of this treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% dries when Amdetavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Caletra (400 mg / Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ammavir was achieved twice daily with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir twice daily), about 40-50% lower than Ammavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ammavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, there is a close monitoring, since the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">It was not a pharmacokinetic trial for the application of ogenera in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antazides component of Didanosin, it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart. (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, it is necessary for the gift of efavirenz in combination with Ammavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustments required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with amovir and saquinvir treatment is not recommended since the exposure of both proteasers would reap.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of neo-pin on other proteasers and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin possibly reduces the serum concentration of Ammcavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, if Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is applied together, caution must be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ammavir and Ritonavir are being difficult to Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of Amdetavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma centric (AUC) by Rifabutin in about 193% and therefore an increase in the inner side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is used together with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended, although no clinical data are prevalent.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aging in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fossils with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to 2,69fold compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of fossils with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are used together with ageneric drugs, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be related to toxic reactions that are combined with these pharmaceuticals, if they are used in combination with ageneric.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasers, it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time like Agenerase, as there can be resortive problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulants known as an enzyme is known (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Ammavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasma bricks of Ammcavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of Calcidikanalblocks such as Amlodipine, diltiazem, pin pin, nibpin, nipppine, nipppine, niodipine, niodipine, niodipine, niodipine, niodipine and verapamil can be increased by 10 by Amravioli, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking with Agenerase, the plasmakeccentric can considerably increase and strengthen the side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days, whereas the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% infidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous application of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of systemic corneal eroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, are significantly expected to increase plasma levels when attaching Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma derivatives of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with amblavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a frequency monitoring of therapeutic levels until stabilization of mirror, since the plasmakeccentric of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased when used by Amravioli (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied together with oral Complaints Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while applying Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteasers indicate a possible increase in plasma levels from Midazolam to transfer 3 to 4 torache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amdetavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opiracy symptom, especially if there are even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as the Amotavir- dose is administered when Ambleavir is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased monitoring of INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or reinforcement of anti-rombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for conception prevention are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of cyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous application of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be applied for the mother in comparison with the possible risk of use for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, Ammavir-related substances were detected, however, it is not known to surpasses Ammcavir in people with breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the immersion in the uterus until the end of the lactation in the uterine until the end of the breastfeeding time, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of income including fertilization and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Ammavir to the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The incidence of aging has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most connected side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly until moderate early in early morning and led to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">For many of these events, it is not clarified if it is related to taking ageneric drugs or other medicines at the same time, or whether they are a result of grillary disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned effects originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protectors did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigational medical examination in connection with study medication, were performed at more than 1% of patients, as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) associated with HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral and fast fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsozervious fat accumulation (bullocks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral people who were treated with Ammavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine in a medium duration of 36 weeks, was observed only one case (bullet) (&lt; 1%).</seg>

<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation smusters can subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to utilize the current interpretation systems for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In the phenotypical resistance-based analysis, clinical evaluation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotype data for estimation of the activity of Ammavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasant-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have clinically developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separators) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amblavir associated genetic patterns generated a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, clove avir and saquinvir remain in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross-resistant and other proteasers for all 4 fossils resistance pact, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral patients, in which a fossil rendition opposed to rainfavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), caviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">The vice-versa retains the activity against some other proteasant-resistant isolates; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance-mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily based on four-treated adults (viruslast ≥ 1000 copies / ml), together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and a standard (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with a low-controlled Ritonavir. "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to aging, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subordinance threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of ingeboostered Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera solution was taken three times daily, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-ated Ritonavir simultaneously; the majority of the patients treated with PI was previously administered at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered under the expected benefit of 'untouched' Agenerase in patients with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ammavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ameliavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ammavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady-state (Cmin, ss) was impacted by food intake, although the simultaneous nutritional intake was influenced and the rate of resorption was influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Ammcavir to the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unbundled amovir, which remains the active portion, probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unfolded Ammcavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing pump in dependence on the aggregate drug concentration in the steady-state above the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drug use the CYP3A4 or inhibit or inhibit a substrate of CYP3A4 if they are given simultaneously with Agenerously (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of ainsase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ammavir exposure as adults with an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amdetavir is made from the solution 14% less bioreavailable as from the capsules; therefore, Agenerously solution and eight-phase capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Even the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be the elimination of ameliavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemas lead to Amroavir plasma samples that are compared to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ammavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the canogenicity with amoavir in mice and rats occurred at male animals of hepatellular adenoma at doses (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Ammcavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-genetic tests, the bacterial reverse testing (Ames-test), microcore test to rats and chromosome aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, was Amotavir nor genetically modified.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical routine by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed, neither during the administration of Agenerase, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity with young, who were treated at an age of 4 days, showed both the controls as well as with the children treated with amacaine treated animals a high mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="2062">During a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposition under therapeutic dose, however, a series of minor changes including thymuselongation and low-related skelongings were observed, which indicates a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules can be applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Ammavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ammavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was measured, however, its effectiveness was measured (by investigating its effect on the reduction of the gag concentration in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of sensued Aldurazyme the gag concentrations in the urine was about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal big liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients), arginstalgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and crushing.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval of the marketing of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by means of recombinant DNA-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstick of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-time enzyme in patients with sighted diagnosis of a Muhysacchariot I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place through a doctor, experience in treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited substance diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial rate of infusion rates of 2 E / kg / h can be increased, every 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no docking scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no docking scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as each in connection, which occurs during the infusion, or until the end of the infusion. (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically those patients should continue to be engined, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment, in the recovery of medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment date.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who have antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution in use of Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As a little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical risk, a hypersensitivity result should be cautious after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or medium-duty infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be woke and / or reduction of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-condition reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are taken to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is being awakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular recording of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave any direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponated over the breast milk, is recommended to steal during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical studies were classified mainly as infusion-related reactions (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable pharmaceutical reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at an treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history, severe reactions came to, including bronchospassports, respiratory and facial expressions (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable pharmaceutical-effects in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a total treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment of a seroconversion, with a severe destructive form, mostly within one month (on average after 26 days, compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study) patients were detected by radioimmunopellcipitation (RIP) assay demonstrable antibodies - including 3 patients, where it never had to be Seroconical.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-antibodies - a robust reduction in the Gag-mirror in the harp, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of Gag in Harn was found.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed marginal to a low-neutral inhibitoric effect on enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed not impaired by clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of undesirable pharmaceutical reactions, although the occurrence of undesirable pharmaceutical reactions were typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for encycline therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed from cells into the lymphoists, most likely to know-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were surveyed from the middle phenotype and only a patient had the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a constant expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute limit in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to the Placebogupe an improvement of the lung function and the ability to be represented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining the effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline of the percentage of FEV is clinically significant in these period, and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with an hepatal treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clearer waste of the Gag-mirror was detected in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who, by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes were interlinked to five patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">One year-old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients who were at the time of her recording in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirrors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a magnitude growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was detected after the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study investigative pharmacodynamic impact of various alliazyme doses have been carried out on the Gag-mirror in the harp, the liver volumes and the 6-minute test test.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (a other drug against cancer) when the cancer is not regreeted (drugs against cancer), and "malignity" (malignant drug may not easily be removed) and "malignant" (caused by an operation alone) and "malignant" of lung cancer, which does not affect the epithelium cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is not treated with patients who previously were not covered, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously used other chemotherapies as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should be taken with Alimta a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, a "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be reduced or decreases.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Thus, the active form of Pemetremixed slowed down the formation of DNA and RNA, preventing the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetremixed into its active form goes into cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells, resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of pharmaceuticals and lengthwise in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelioma Alimta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small lung cancer, the effects of Alimta was compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of Docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), and both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and cisplatin, survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who had previously used chemotherapy was to receive an average survival compared with Alimta 8.3 months compared with 7.9 months in Docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies patients, however, in which cancer does not attack the squamous epithelial cells, with the administration of Alimta extended survival.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. an approval for the placing on the market of Alimta in the whole European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma, except for prevailing epithelioral histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma after preceding chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF administered as intravenous infusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Reduction in frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given a day before and on the day of pemetre-treatment as well as the day after treatment a Kortikosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake needs to be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for a further 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetremixed dose, as well as any third release cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who have Pemetremixed, should be created before every gift a complete blood-image, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a tromboyclood.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the start of a new treatment course, a dose test will be taking place under Consider the blood clone or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the prege- hitting therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which apply for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 Blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">To develop patients non-hematological toxicity of 3 (with the exception of neurotoxins), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient must decrease the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dose reductions, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxins.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over, compared to patients aged 65 years, an elevated rate of trivi- ko exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for the application with children under 18 years of age not adequate data for inconceivable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustments required for all patients recommended Dosage adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; from the upper limit value (with metastases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) is not investigated especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be administered in patients with regard to the bone margation and pemetremixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophourism has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrality number, thromboyclocount and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known adverse events that were found after the market launch of orlistat, is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to deficiencies in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days, without significant clinical examination.</seg>
<seg id="2533">During the majority of the cases notified by orlistat-overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on human and animal, from a quick reformation of systemic effects that are attributable to orlistat properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect puts the therapeutic effect in the lumens of stomach and upper small intestine by covalent bonds to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pankreatic lids.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times daily taken by the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with hypokaloric, fetal induced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, alteration of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), has been rated as follows: as a change of the body weight in the course of course (Table 1) and as part of those study participants, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial balance (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed above 12 months, the greatest weight loss was observed in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of the LDL cholesterol with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo-3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma centurine of non-metabolised orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, there was no metabolized orlistat in plasma at only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients that the minimal systematic resorated dose could be administered, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyysiated Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine group), which presented approximately 42% of the total plastic macroentric.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting are (as Cisplatin), as well as Chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by an additional application of a corticosteroid (a medicine which can be used as Antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), on the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received Chemotherapies, which are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In Chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are shown to 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153% of the patients treated with Ondansetron).</seg>
<seg id="2615">When compared with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severe waste disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding a corticosteroid in front of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colodarage, patients with anamnesty obtaining or signs of subacute Ileus after injection maschal can be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, like with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable to extend ponosetron, which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended, or tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy, nor for prevention, nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron does not inhibit the five investigated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-equip concentration oric metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population-based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 Inhibitors, Doxetubicin, Fluoxetine, Doxetubicin, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, ranitidine, and Terbinafin) no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies do not lie before, hence, Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless prescribed by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency ranges from undesirable events were observed like in other dosages. there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who were randomised to treat patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 1 hour), which was reduced to day 1 without the examines.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphate and Dacarbazin, and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron received, which were randomized on Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and dagasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the primary and repolarisation of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered in single doses ranging from 0,25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma centralized, a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma centric (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 m g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses that was measured at 11 Hodenkaroma patients (± SD) in the Palonosetron plasma center at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">The pharmacokinetic simulations produced a total exposure of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, with after one-off intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was increased from 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron compared to Palonosetron than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation showed that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose were found in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After an unique intravenous wrongation in Geshurry, the total full-body weight 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Indeed, in patients with severe liver function interrupt the terminal elimination, and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increased, however, reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are seen as sufficient above the maximum human exposure exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies showed indications that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be prolong in ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose may be given in approximately the 30x of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasty (in thyroid, pituitary) and skin tumours by rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and da Aloxi is intended for human being used, the relevance of this results were considered for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients on placebo and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin cells, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies at Hautwater were taken together, they said about 90% of patients in both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was diagnosed with the treatment of Abszessen (overcrowded hollow in the body tissue) or of infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1-10 of 100 patients) is a reduction in the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo at short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, radiced or inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the market launch of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who show no improvement in two to three days, should be considered once and an alternative therapy must be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation caused by the use of Retapamulin ointment, the treatment is canceled carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy can be begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary studies, the efficacy of retinapamulin was caused by patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be taken into account if a 2- or 3-day treatment is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retinapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centralized, which were achieved in humans following topical application, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo are not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After convivial treatment of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on the chopped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, Dosage adjustments are not required for treatment when topical retinapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral dosage and are inadequate for a statement on the birth and the federal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin saline should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminate or the therapy with Altargo continues / terminate it is between the benefit of the nursing infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have used Altargo, was the most frequently reported side effects on the administration site that consider about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction in a specific binding place of the 50s by the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The data indicates that the Binding station ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomalen P-bond and the Peptide-transfering centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding place inhibit Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide-transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retinapamulin should be conceivable at least some of the infections should be consulted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the Isolate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treat the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (like PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidine) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin salts daily under occlusion on intact and applied for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin saline twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of phytomatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Rehearsation took place in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each of the mediation and in the children aged 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption of people after topical application was reduced by 1% salts to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin was primarily used by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro verification on commutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernels to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was no male nor with female rats from reduced fertilicity of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thereby attained up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2) was sworn by skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryo study on rats were detected at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to a ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development polarity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the regulatory approval must ensure that a pharmaceutical company is present, as in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation process (Version 6.2) and works before the product will be marketed as long as the sold product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the placing on the market is obliged to implement detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical activities, as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which will be agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Profitable products for Human Use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated site, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Don't hesitate any other ointments, creams or lotions on an area that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the salads come from verbs on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice if it occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases, which affect the liver) with children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in the context of two doses existing vaccinations, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">This reason, Ambirix can only be used when the immunisation is an inflow risk of hepatitis B infection, and ensured that the vaccination can be caused by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If an accumulation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine is given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines do, by supporting the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "how it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detect viruses and the surface antigens as "strange" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine vaccine grown in 1996 and the vaccine has been approved by the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered in the context of three doses existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indian for the efficacy was the proportion of germinated children who had developed a month after the last injections a protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B during the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Ambirix degree in a six-month and a 12-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, maternal (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to patients who may react sensitively (allergic reactions) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a licence for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the Grundimerization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered in the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If an accumulation is wished for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) inhibitor of anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) inhibitor values range in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully secured, whether immune-competent individuals who need on a Hepatitis A- vaccination is required, because they may also be protected from immune memory through the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injection-materials used in the rare case of anaphylactic response, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended for hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAVER and anti-HBS antibody is achieved so that in these cases, the gift of additional vaccination doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intra-narrow injection or intramuscular administration may lead to a suboptimum impedance, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, when Thromboyctopenia or bleeding problems, Ambirix can injected withdrawn subcutaneous injections since it can occur in these cases intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambition was administered in the second year of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine was given to the immune response to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients suffering from immunosuressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may not be sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternal, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable with the prevalence that was observed in previous thiomerate and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines ambirix were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years the ambition of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans of combination simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mateness on a calculation basis per vaccination basis Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects in accordance with the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects had received 66.4% of the subjects, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects, which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matcha was similar to high (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, Ambirix were compared with 36.2% in the test subjects, which received the 3-cans combination of combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of lower pain and maternal mortality was low and comparable, which was observed after administration of the combination-simulant with the 3-cans vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- until 11 year old vaccines the occurrence of local reaction and general interactions was comparable to hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11-year-olds, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which reported over heavy side effects during the 2-doses of vaccines with a 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B-Virus was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were given a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered (in the month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered (in the month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study which was carried out at 12- until including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinations used with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was invaluable, the serum levels (SP in the table below) was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose regains significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- until 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines were either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of the primdimerization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-antibodies and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected through a minimum of 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunodeficiency observed in this study was similar to both antigens being comparable to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combination, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- up to including 15-year-olds, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be comparable 24 months after immunisation in 0-6 months vaccination scheme is similar to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambirix was given at the same time with the accumulation of a combined diphthie-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccines (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of combined measles-mumps in vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this present formulation was conducted for the present formulation of similar seroprotective and seroconversions as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after the resusal to investigate a foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix is not fully protecting against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (although you have not been infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (although you feel / your child can't feel uncomfortable or sick / feel) a disease may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself by juckling skin attacks, breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • if you have played an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you wish to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prior appointment of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">During a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician will betray you / your child from a vaccination with Ambience.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine, with a reduced content of invertebrates per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine is administered at a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection against the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambirix is suffering from people who are injected to severe blood clots, if you are weakened to the skin and not into the muscle tissue, or if you / your child is undergoing to undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can be insufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is required.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Speak to your doctor, if you have taken your child or take another medicine (including those who have been vaccinated without prescriptions) or if you have been vaccinated / or Immunglobuline (antibodies) have been given or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, in that case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">When a vaccine is given at the same time with ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, ambition is not administered to pregnant women or lactating women except for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B will be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been announced since issuing the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP revealed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix is only allowed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with an incomplete enzyme (brain compensation for a high degree of ammonia concentrations) in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided into several single boxes - split, under food mixed or via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall in the gastric tube) or a nose sun (through the nose into the gastric tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparative study because Ammonaps don't work with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also cause appetite loss, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, toothache, flushing, nausea, constipation, nausea, constipation, nausea, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle was effectively avoids.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances, since due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (complete enzyme defective, which is manifested after the first life of life), there is an indication of the use when in the Anamnese form a hyperammonite encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not capable of swallowed tablets or for patients with hatching disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually prescribed under consideration of protein tolerability and for the growth and development of daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early-proof lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0,4-0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hatching problems, as a risk of the emergence of estuagusulzera, if tablets can't get away immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and dementia use only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As Metabolization and elimination of sodium phenylbutyate about liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous administration of phenylacate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal contamination and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed friction of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected whether Phenylacacetate is divorced when human breast milk is divorced, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events were assumed that they were not combined with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorektic patient, which developed a metabolic Encephalopathy, severe hypokalemia, Panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with a accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are used with accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dossilimiting neurotoxicity with an intravenous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacacetate is a metabolized connection with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is divorced through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the capture of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle may be assumed to be produced for every gram, sodium phenylbutyate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inflicas, and the disease has led to death for Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemostalysis, the utilisation of the nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids (however, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn) in postpartal (however within the first life of living).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was treated with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-proof form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygintranny-deficiency), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyate and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyate and its metabolites became also studied with cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking an interval of phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic disturbances or hemoglobbopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate was present in the plasma next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This medication is divorced within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyate had no anti-toxic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat will be taken either oral (infant and children who can't have no tablets, or patients with hatch disturbances) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nose sonen.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infant and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum samples in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early-proof lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle may be assumed that every gram of genomic sodium phenylbutyamin can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in granules, 15 minutes after taking an average plasma centric center of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute corporal syndrome" (ACS), for instance at unstable Angina (a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomal measurement of the electrocardiograph or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiosox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who use one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can enhance patients with angina or heart attack for maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at all of the treatment of angiogenesis or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulans) and GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp), and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was angiosox - with or without the gift of GPI - to prevent new events (deaths, heart attacks or revolving) after 30 days or a year, as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo one PCI, Angiox was in relation to all indicators as effectively as Heparin, except for severe blood vessels, where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiosox may not be used in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludins, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had a blood pressure, as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to provide approval for the placing on the market of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (IA / NSTEMI) in case of emergency use or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initials of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous Bolusement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is carried out using a PCI option, an additional Bolus should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure is given an increase of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiosox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous cell release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The security and effectiveness of a general Bolus-gift of Angiox was not studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI encroachment is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened to 225 seconds (ACT), a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened to 225 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstitutionally and diluted medicines should be mixed carefully and quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is treated with one PCI (whether with bivalirudin against ACS is treated or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdose.</seg>

<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active substance or against Hirudine • active blood circulation or increased blood risk disorders. • serious uncontrolled hypertension and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of hemorrhage, especially when Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anti-anagulans (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using PCI patients suffering from bivalirudin most blood cells occur in patients who can undergo a percutaneous intervention (PCI), during treatment with a percutaneous hemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, should be drawn to monitoring the INR-Werts (International normalised Ratio) in order to ensure that the value after setting up the treatment with bivalescudin again reached the treatment existing before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the reaction of anticulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thromboyctenants), the active ingredients can increase blood pressure.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were summarised according to comprehensive application in practice and are summarised in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage, treatment with bivalirudders should be canceled immediately and to monitor the patient in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which is located in the catalytic centre as well as on the anionenbinary region of thrombin binds, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudine in thrombin, and thus its effect is reversible, because Thrombin sled the binding of bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine was caused by bivalirudine in serum samples in which it had come to heparinininduced Throboyctopenie / heparininduced Thrombal Syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thrombocyte aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudine is showing a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect, which is assigned by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If in the patient was performed using a PCI option, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease based on the body not sufficient insulin to control the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insullulisin differs very marginally from humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter minimum of activity has become a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in use in combination with type 1 diabetes in combination with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance glykosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>

<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or the breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-insulin-type diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazia; these states are potentially explosive threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin is required under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin-used insulin and can therefore change with changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar activity and increase the inclination to hypoglysis cells, include oral antidiabetic, angiopene-Oxidase, Monoamin-Oxidase, Monoamin-Oxidase, Propoxyphics, Salizylates and Sulfonamid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic, Clonidine, Guanethidin, and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenees can be shakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin is overcoming into human breast milk, but in general, insulin is not resorated in breast milk, nor is being resorated after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Hereinafter referred to in clinical trials, those from clinical studies are listed, grouped according to system organic classes, and frequently: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1.000; not known (frequency on the basis of the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-weldness, cool and classed skin, fatigue, nervousness, or tread, anxiety, unusual creation or weaknesses, confusion, dizziness, excessive dogs, headache, nausea and heart palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed, to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglysis with injuselessness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by a doctor, or treated by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After Glukagonist injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urality of the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels through stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery times faster and the activity time shorter is shorter than in hud normal normal inulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes moss TUS showed an insulin-relevant metering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase of gluing effects, precisely like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insullulisin has a double-fast effectiveness as normal human insulin and achieved the complete gluing effect around 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that during an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable post-ranged glycaemic control is achieved, as with humanly normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insullulisin 2 minutes before meal was gearing, was reached a better postpranal control than with humankind Normal ulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insullulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is turned, a comparable glycaemic control is given as in the normal normal rate (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin pulisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal inulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin pulisin for 20 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
