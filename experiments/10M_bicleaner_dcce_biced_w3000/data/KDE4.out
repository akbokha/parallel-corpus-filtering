the speci@@ fic@@ ity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of graph@@ ically @-@ coloured folders with help of a @-@ called Tree @-@ map . each object is indicated by a rectangle that is proportional to its size . this size must have the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . consequently , large files , even if they can easily be detected , as a graphical and interactive Version of &amp; UNIX ; Command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ Display a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for sim@@ pler navigation , the right @-@ corner provides meaning@@ ful colour and lab@@ eling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched over view of colour mode , can display either depth for easy detection of the fusion depth or image of a different file system , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rectangle can be determined with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for every feature , you can specify if enough space is available , or whether the area of sub @-@ ordin@@ ates shall be used ( whereby the accuracy is displayed by limitations in the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
at the presentation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should always be observed , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry , and this setting is not always available . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rectangle square is square .
as parti@@ tioning the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is thus advant@@ ageous for the labelling and prevention of plac@@ ements through frame always advant@@ ageous that rectangle are possible , the best possible methods are possible , columns , columns or recur@@ sive runner @-@ up .
you can set the minimum mentioned area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a diamond pattern in the area of the ordered entry is drawn , in order to indicate that this area is actually indicated by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission of the computer . the camera will also be implemented as a USB mass memory device . the camera can also use over the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras are using the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital kam@@ er@@ as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transfers across the serial port , this link is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . it supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support . the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 cam@@ cor@@ ders . if the EX@@ IF support is not used by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 images , you will possibly be able to see , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ plug ; it is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a common module for developing &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .

what is a digital inventory management even beyond the end of the trial ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process and the permanent saving . each of the photos takes place , scans or digital photos will make this form of digital inventory management . but most of us don &apos;t make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to backup your images , find , remove and upload photos . we look at the procedures for digital phot@@ ogra@@ ders , remove , remove , group@@ ing , ass@@ uring , optim@@ ise , visu@@ alis@@ es , archived , backup , waiting , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , indicated , categorized , search , search , transformed , conf@@ ection@@ ery , and exported contents the one @-@ monetary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata is defined as data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition , information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I couldn &apos;t claim to find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t have to know how many photos you have won &apos;t want to save a certain photo . if you don &apos;t want to save met@@ adata for both in a database as well as in the image files , you can easily access and securely access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know what you have to do something in your system . your image files must have been organized on your computer , whether you want to save it on your computer or on a network device &amp; etc ; Be@@ ware that you will have to change to a larger device .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you &apos;re going to organize enough photos , then you &apos;ll use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work processes , constant growth of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes p@@ ile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files facilitates backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are searching for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to save met@@ adata in the creation page of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization . if you forget that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data can be saved in the file , then you can subsequently select the met@@ adata from the database into the corresponding point .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what do you want to change ; it &apos;s a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important .
now start the real work , since you can select all pictures , labels and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures , which you need the same attribute and then place the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best pictures .
let us continue using keyword , keywords , how you frequently use other programs frequently , or categories . every three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ized images from another source with embedded application , then add &amp; digi@@ tization ; automatically build the images to the right place . the modified keyword will be done by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; updated and updates the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ lap . this is a very coar@@ se representation as every block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are characteristic of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ze your met@@ adata .
you want to let any@@ body know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are safe to know how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer look at some details , people , the place .
and now I say that this is the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period of time you may even hear the silence . the label has completely changed your attention to this panorama .
for others , consider the title itself more important than the picture itself is more important than the picture itself . if you want to show a story . do you think it is the meaning to help Him to help him about the motive that you move , what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only has an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can export a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you would like to export your images into the label and / or the title of the Web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you will need to tell you a second time for opening images .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet on Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation has already been with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your journeys with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to Gall@@ er@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with Copyright and describes the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms shall also apply in all amended versions , i.e. even for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information you should be :
author ( syn@@ onym for actors and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to be the name of a company or organization , it should not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples are the title of the photographer , free professional photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the author &apos;s field , this also has to be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a warehouse , then the group / agency will be listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although it does not provide protection against mis@@ use . everybody knows this problem in the image of embedded met@@ adata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos only . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future , there will be such a module for p@@ ile processing .
topics : record mistake , record failure , stream@@ lining , EC@@ C , transmission error , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ per@@ ation , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that you can pass on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest recovery firm , has some interesting statistics that has reasons for data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they need to be treated for more than a few years . of course , you can also find CDs and DVDs in archive quality who claim to be more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it lies in your discretion room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disp@@ ensing and good recording , but you are not much more expensive than the cheap@@ est , but you write much more reliable . so it is about to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors even if you are just written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for formatt@@ ing and the control environments . despite this massive protection it requires through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a cost @-@ effective program named I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster will perform the apparently wonders among CDs and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged disks of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn the data back to a high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . then you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author characteristics and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppy disks keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing must include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ fault study
shortly , if you are at the longest temperature range from 35 ° C up to 45 ° C , this error is the most common fault guard , SMA@@ RT can &apos;t notice this error . some of the SMA@@ RT fixed errors are obvious . this is particularly Les@@ ef@@ er and publishing counter . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses usually leave again without any major problems .
while most electric devices can &apos;t matter many electrical devices , these can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause heavy damage , complete data loss , hardware loss , modified mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself from the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current sp@@ ikes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs energy heat and the rest is normally available . do not think any plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects the protection against flash@@ backs , thereby protecting the right connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems , which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connecting facilities for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable voltage protection . therefore a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection is used to protect your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to loss of un@@ warran@@ ted data . it can therefore be useful in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically place battery energy when a power failure occurs . if you want to keep your data even further , you should be sure that it fulfil@@ s the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed , and compare its security in power problems with the costs to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; Euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about it . at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a device under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular deal offering you any data stored on data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services which are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will get your pictures not available , in the event of Flick@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage . thus , they are scanning .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator . all transmis@@ sions are due for transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs put at least the data integ@@ r@@ arity between the operating system and the disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ comfortable until you have not discovered a photo until you have no protection for it . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data road than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses because they generate inter@@ ferences inside the data streams . in normal file systems these f@@ aults remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates back to a lower level , and it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ unker file system . it is still used in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % when not@@ ebooks is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of viruses . it is currently limited to a lower damage ( e.g. theft or re@@ installations ) ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer sigh@@ ted .
open Source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrec@@ tly , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . this is a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrec@@ tly , only the speed of the investigation process during a su@@ dden inter@@ ruption is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . meant that the technology continues to continue its progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is already deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and the end result . even DSLR cameras did your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; Euro ; so you don &apos;t get any@@ body else for data loss . therefore , secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you can make this backup like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you take your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ crafts : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a no local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , it is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete securing : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete security and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files which have been changed since the last backup . generate several snap@@ shots . this backup is made to one such backup at any time . this securing is made possible with the exception that it is only decreased and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that really changed . this happens , and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure your images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ tically medium .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a moment@@ um for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , in the image file saved IP@@ TC files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , using the Internet .
so valuable images can survive the next 40 years that is about the time span that you are really interested in you , because they re@@ mind you of your childhood or adoles@@ cence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , everything must be said today . unfortunately , there is no other way to look back as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should have used yourself as the current system back@@ wards . depending on the number you have been used in the past , it is easier to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you are so an old system , it is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other side the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the subject print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means actually always enlarge .
let &apos;s go from that you have chosen the scal@@ ability with you and they want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ I / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ B ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and travel FS / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software even if one day can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is sim@@ pler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it &apos;s loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ ati@@ st data for a better color assignment , but not as many as TIFF . this format we would like to store you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however , that this format can be adjusted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open mass image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the usage of met@@ adata . it is already available on the TIFF / EP format and required to use met@@ adata . it is now available to use the Canon and Nikon D@@ NG .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has been introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a file that allows users to convert your data into one file itself . file information are saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers do it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , which records met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can be superior to link between the met@@ adata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider how to use D@@ NG as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , which support a wide range of application areas and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI @-@ communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops to achieve extensive acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the reader , or the scanner . for example , you can use the images on the cam@@ er@@ ame@@ dium , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save those in your tube . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you want to add the pictures , then you should add the met@@ adata to the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them in web@@ gal@@ eries , you can use in MPEG , please print in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can add a description that you can already add on your hard drive . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album bank .
to use your digital camera by &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . for some cameras , the file names are displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol are displayed for each file , photos , films , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you can possibly require the camera information on each entry . with the lateral bars and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo information that will be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that for some digital cameras don &apos;t have any information available .
the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ adata as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc . the picture is the same as with the met@@ adata panel &apos;s main window , or image processing . please note that this met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then add the photos from their camera to a single album . when downloading , the pictures are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option to download and then choose the photos . the button download is available as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . this pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures are available with a star in preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons , you can download a dialog , with which you can select your destination album , sorted according to the list of existing albums , sorted in section My albums . then select the destination album out of the list and press OK .
after completing the target album , press OK , and digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the requested photos , you can delete this from the camera by delete the button . if you just want to delete the button , you &apos;ll need to delete it first and delete out .
note that there is no possibility to restore photos which you have deleted from the camera . you should be sure to delete it out . if you want to delete it out of the camera . if you want to delete it out of the camera , you should make this much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually installed , if you have taken photos from different recording applications , if you have taken photos from different recording applications , this can be useful , the date and time to integrate the file into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors the image and date @-@ based signatures . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during transmission opens three further options , which will be conducted before the photos can be saved on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . do not switch the date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the command of the command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , den &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , the camera is stored in a preview that will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about orientation of the camera to the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the aspect bar Metad@@ ata you can find further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally enabled , and when your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ plug it ; the photo in original orientation : if you want the automatic rotation , use the button nar@@ row@@ ed and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom section of the window .
when your camera was made available , at which the photo was made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ plug ; this under@@ go is based on the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . all the cameras are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all the cameras available . in the section side@@ bar @-@ data you can read what about your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , and digi@@ plug it ; the photos can switch directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to switch the button nar@@ row@@ ed and select the disk @-@ based bottom bracket at the bottom end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button download . you can then select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; it can also be uploaded to the files that can be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ al ; you where the pictures are uploaded to the pictures . select the desired folder and press OK to launch the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a common term in this document . this means that the data can be displayed in length and l@@ atitude . the determination of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to send an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental pl@@ anners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten your photo , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ When you want to document the location of the photos , it is easy to document the position of photos from the photos .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has supported many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , on a processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last more than the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with one cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of the GPS data from one device can be used with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ ur . however , these data must be saved in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from the GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ v@@ ey . it uses the default coordinates to be created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com is showing no European street types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that can be accessed by pressing the settings ; you can select in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
action can be set on Embedded preview or image processing . they thus put the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fest when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ed identity and copyright data . this data is automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . the data when downloading from the camera body is written into the IP@@ TC @-@ fields .
author is a syn@@ onym for author of the photographer . this field should include the photographer of photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description for authorization , this field must be full .
Editor is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this is not to be the author , if this is the picture another &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ eten@@ quot ; . if the image is a warehouse , then the group or agency will be provided here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ field . this met@@ adata is permanently included in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; this met@@ adata is also available and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without lost .
image fittings as embedded inscription ( J@@ F@@ IF ) into JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images embedded in pictures , which are already contained in images , these are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ plug .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear in the main window above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is indicated or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be removed , you can remove the file extensions of this list ; Alb@@ um@@ folders that does not have this expan@@ sions , are igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Update right from each category .
the settings of the light output &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page . if you are then enabled , these settings are switched on . if you have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better overview results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can use the tool bar when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this insight can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the detailed explanation .
with the P@@ NG comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as P@@ NG needed a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thus means 1 : a low and 9 compression .
using the TIFF @-@ files option , you can disable the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TIFF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm uses loss@@ less .
with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size was better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not supported , met@@ adata was still not supported but in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is only a photo stand for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing settings .
the default bandwidth is that all green pixels are identical to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at od@@ d lines . if you use this option , this creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , white drops of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set off . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that the exposed photos can be found in four steps more details into the top @-@ lights . for other cameras this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the Spitz@@ bergen , i.e. the parts of your images are embedded in the settings of your camera . setting the setting colors , because it displays the more unusual results , as it displays the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ es . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ lights .
this is possible , since blue pixels is generally not as fast as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red percentage of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image separately .
set the L@@ umin@@ ant to your taste . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ image processing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ waiting small , you should be conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ ism algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data that have many cameras and provides a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ ome w offers three alternatives to you : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , he produces color paintings on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color rendering of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can set the rotor and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color ref@@ us@@ al correction , while it is performed during the feed@@ backs .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and provides instructions as this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information how to translate color information from one colour space in the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions if a picture in image processing is opened / color management module with raw files .
colour profile folders : set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / .@@ color / ICC , where you all store your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; this folder will examine these folders during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles here are the ability &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ c@@ ali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here , only your pictures color is not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be created to the camera actor and model you are using . not all profiles are created on the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be used as your camera and a few colors therefore very saturated . this could be manually adjusted , rather than on the blind algorithm your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obviously which color profile is designed for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can recognize the style of the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface designed by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image views and image processing ; many modules support , which have been written to work together with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you can select a list of available modules , and they are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the Main window , and beyond that there are some also in the context menu .
Short@@ cuts for tasks that are performed by modules can be set in the menu below settings .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust the time between image transi@@ tions , normally are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other settings will turn on the met@@ adata in the lower end of the pictures during the ad .
the camera properties shows a list of all the cameras supported on the left . if you want to use a button , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , you are currently converting , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . you have to specify a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / dev to specify your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera with your computer to display them into the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the window of the window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option dialog for Move &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be shut @-@ silent through &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option to use the changes in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also see the display of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting the starting grid , it accelerates the starting process &amp; digi@@ plug .
when you &apos;re looking for new photos , drag &amp; digi@@ plug ; the basic folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos . if something was deleted from the basic folder , ask &amp; digi@@ plug it out of the database .
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this settings can be used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can choose settings from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and improve the image processing through a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the details and selecting the entry .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so you are not part of your distribution . more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current picture size indicates .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the processing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no other features will change the original photo before you save file Save or button Save from the tool bar if you don &apos;t want to recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make sure a copy of your image before you modify it . you can save it with file Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Edit file again . you lose any change that you have done in the photo since last save .
almost any promotion of image processing can be restored or recovered . the last action can be retri@@ eved , re@@ loc@@ ating editing or re @-@ produced by selecting Edit menu from the menu .
if you frequently use this frequently use the keyboard short@@ cut , Ctrl ; -@@ z to reverse and Ctrl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , the tool@@ bar , or rest@@ oring button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions you will be made between , too , and recovered .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in the photo and zoom out in it Ctrl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or select the entries in the setup menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Image Mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to change this , you can change this from &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window will be calling ; see the section to set up image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the file format and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can download the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole movements . all picture preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods . when you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice only .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which makes important information and actions available for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available , even in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multi@@ ples click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar will appear and disappear into the edge .
in the label , you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert . note that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , allowing you to use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are excluded after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented it , you can either use the button or switch to the next picture , the labels will be saved .
apart from the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , it is always conducted if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting which is always written into the pictures .
the evaluation of the evaluation scheme is used from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding is followed by the schema in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keyword , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; session applied .
the keyword @-@ tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the set search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of sampling during a photo series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keyword may also be set by selecting the respective suits in tree . all keywords of the image are stored into the keyword in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , if you do not want to select a keyword , if you want to select a keyword with a keyword , please read the keyword .
the bar chart is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar will be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . if additionally , one or more keyword filters are displayed on the right side . all created keyword will be available .
you can also drag and leave . accepted several pictures in the main view . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply drag it out from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then , a dialogue , which you asks if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword is selected on one keyword . they were selected using Ctrl + a , and then a keyword will be taken on the right @-@ tree on the selection and then put it there . a dialogue asks if this keyword will be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also be switched off settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it must be one or be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry according to the database is chosen . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group . the options look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ al ; s addressed implementation .
the reason why you set a color @-@ managed workflow , which is the colors created by your camera or scanner , you can achieve a predic@@ table deviation from which of your camera or sc@@ anners are equal to those of which you print , or sc@@ anners , or in the web , publish them from your digital night@@ club .
if the theme is on color management , everybody wants to press what buttons he wants to express it . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should get links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions .
if your image work@@ flows meet all criteria of six below , then you don &apos;t need to worry about color management .
you can work on a monitor that has been calib@@ rated at s@@ RGB colour space . ( for further information you will find below )
your only other picture issues are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works as well and the life for all so simple , why should you use another colour space and have to make thought about color oil ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ g @-@ shaped region , and the colours in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some bigger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s page and then click on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kill my monitor , if I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you want to work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to convert your monitor ( RGB mode ) that your monitor is connected to s@@ RGB . if you use it as the colour space of s@@ RGB , you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try to process an additional manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , decre@@ asing automatic and contrast expand the menu automatically try to make the best possible from your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment the best with these effects , which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the entire image , so that the dark point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a mag@@ ical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same method adjust the illumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the Int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ ality is the same number of pixels . sometimes , it is a very powerful operation , which causes either mi@@ racles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast increase : this method improves contrast and the luminous intensity of RGB values of a picture by the move the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white cover of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out white pictures of a photos .
the white @-@ like correction is a bit restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bits per color . if you are able to perform areas with over@@ exposure . if you are able to perform white drops in the raw mode , which means that your possibilities can fall better in the 16 @-@ bit mode .
this tool is based on a Weiß@@ ab@@ equivalent algorithm in the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it will start with menu entry colors white and image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the tool image . if you want to see the original whi@@ pped , then it is enough to click on the lower window .
the preview of the target photos comes with a red mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram will appear , once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ant values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows adjust the shadow ails of your photos or also down dim@@ ms .
tigh@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click on this button to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white pattern . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white pictures with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the coating dict@@ ator boo@@ sts the colors when more than one color channel has been over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in a white indicator . this is shown in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and store are exactly this . each adjustment of the Weiß@@ ab@@ equ@@ s you can set you to back in a text file and later re@@ load it later .
the default settings will return all filter values again on their standard value and the corresponding neutral white cover . note that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original . if you save this image , your original image will be changed .
here you can set the co@@ di@@ fication depth of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the wide spread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images but also needs more disk space , calcul@@ ates and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog for processing pipe images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ es.@@ The color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ ds . an detailed manual for use of colour profiles can be taken into the chapter of color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu among colors . this tool provides a built @-@ in path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so you can use it for several photos . this is helpful when your camera or Scanner do always need the same error . in the manual for sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Color effects provides four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the image has been inver@@ ted . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically is possible . another increase produces a negative image that is not so on to generate photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a saturation point that makes it a stronger contra@@ sting effect which makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name designed for a light @-@ engine@@ ered color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers strongly saturated color colors , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who hardly believe in landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on contra@@ sts . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large pictures the filter can deliver the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color con@@ tr@@ ast and the light@@ ness of the photos . you can use the different color @-@ effects of your photos below colors . as soon as you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you get a photo at bad lighting conditions , you can get the converted problem . also in this case , you can reduce the saturation instead of saturation . if the result you can perform the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ att@@ age / contrast / Gamma , the tool provides sound correction to improve exposure . also , if the dialog is very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . in concrete , the three shooting down below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three ke@@ epers of the image are cli@@ cked , and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the light areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the control kno@@ bs , how the image changes .
on the right side you can view the original and preview of the picture . the preview will be dynamic , using the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box , if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ze .
the three color pin@@ out can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each range . there are also two controllers possible to modify the output values for example . the compression of the output values can be used as background can be used as background to create something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically placed in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the selected values can be saved in the file system and later re@@ loaded . to this , the Gim@@ p level is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted to all shadow , means and sunny , and click the preview of the original image to replace the hist@@ ogram &apos;s input , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ as .
the coating dict@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels . this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue Channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , and the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
change channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this cage , two symbols are located between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour is created . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
when you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ dent and the corresponding picture pixels will be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photo is a red mar@@ ker . if you want to change this marking on the corner you will change a right line on this line and move it on this line and move it on and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve can have created you in the file system and later be loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ dish format .
if you want to use this method and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , the control points of the curve for all channels of the sh@@ adows , central and solar panels . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use the control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the coating dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant channel . shadow and sun@@ shield was used and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color sh@@ aded shots of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour range of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference as you can correct the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview of The original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target features a red mar@@ ker . if you are positioned in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allows you to keep these channels . if you add L@@ umin@@ ance , this is especially convenient if you can also activate the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you can also enable the option to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color is visible on the same place in the channel channel and its room pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion into which you first reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can be stored for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the coating dict@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels . this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo shown in the blue Channel . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abst@@ rac@@ tion . with the development of digital photographs , black / white one work step , since colour pictures can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good enough for all scen@@ ic images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Grün@@ filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linear filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filters : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic fall effects and sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ies to the day @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
sep@@ iat@@ on : produces warm bright and medium tones while keeping a bit cold in the sh@@ adows . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ iat@@ ric . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and with similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool texture apply , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless if it is a colour image or not , you can look like a oil painting on a screen , a pop art portrait out of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry image texture . image processing can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three dimensional of texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual is applied on the picture below . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified version ( 2 ) has been set to 200 .
digi@@ plug with the digi@@ plug ; Adding tool to add a decorative frame to a picture .
the eye of an observation must be observed in the limits of a photo . it is possible to keep his attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . continuously inhib@@ it the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white pictures ) , it adds a cute three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively add a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the frame width in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you have used the tool .
with this practical tool , you can insert an formatt@@ ed text in an image to any arbit@@ rary place . this is also possible when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use Tex@@ tile direction , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its features like you need . you &apos;ll just select a frame about the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is finished .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you push the button &quot; OK &quot; if the image is saved once , the text part of the picture is not changed .
using &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Templates apply to a template over a picture .
the menu image template approaches to image processing can be used to put templates across a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions about the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format and you should want to add your template @-@ size ( 9 ) to compare your template @-@ size to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you have to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you will select the template files .
after the root folder was set for templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of a template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder is automatically updated .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button increases the shown picture . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to use the mouse . if you want to enlarge the template on the whole picture , you must decrease the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template picture . take the image and place it on the desired position .
OK , if you want to use the template onto your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple but particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . it is not a bit more psych@@ edel@@ ic . they can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by copyright of Win@@ ston Chang .
it is possibly the best of three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is that the digi@@ tization of colors will be printed . this again shows that sharp edges are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need greater sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for the private user application .
in JPEG pictures , a camera internal sharp@@ ness is often used . images in the case @-@ format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner will already apply a shar@@ pen@@ sive filter during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate it , you get control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ pen@@ ing . you can correct the menu entry .
but you should get careful because the results don &apos;t work very naturally : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can correct further information on the menu entry . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to correct soft@@ ness is much easier than it . use the menu to correct soft@@ ness , and experiment some with settings . the dialog box on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ urred is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often stim@@ ulated good results and should always be tried out . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask to strongly make the noise and the impression of atro@@ cities in the vicinity of sharp edges will create .
the radius represents like many pixels on each side of a channel through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness will be set .
the sw@@ elling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and to apply difference amount . you can define areas with a soft switching between tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore , beauty par@@ ab@@ norm@@ alities are avoided in face , po@@ uring and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Re@@ focuses on a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to move a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing on photo . this is better to try the photo . it uses a technique named F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is mostly used as un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it out of the menu by using colors re@@ focusing on image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ ission works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ its . the G@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is also influenced by the source pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ission is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . this causes un@@ wanted results .
body sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ bl@@ urred but then on Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be measured from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filters : increase the smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,1 may be extremely rare . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg . 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to so@@ oner .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you might have to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ m filter .
matrix size : this value is determined to generate good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any arbit@@ rary parameters will be set to you and can then be loaded for later and then be loaded .
try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color , and intensity tubes on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should Apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is possible to remove arti@@ facts . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can see that the optimal lin@@ eup filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b smoo@@ thing reli@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area of the dar@@ kened , to create a natural pup@@ il .
the color t@@ ine allows an adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool designed to remove arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ die Algorith@@ m was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform glasses about the picture . for larger values , mainly homogen@@ ous regions should get further necessary . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is needed . please note that it should always be subject to the accuracy of accuracy .
direction @-@ dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD smo@@ kers , a high value w@@ avy @-@ like pattern will produce a high value with a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value accordingly to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is believed to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
drop @-@ up da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . consider that small angles should be a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step distance in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the multi @-@ quality feature is only low . it doubles but the running time . we therefore recommend it to allow him out .
buttons Save as and load do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast when working . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after it . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the button demo@@ li@@ tion anytime .
below you can see image errors with little arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera that is caused by a bad film location during the trip . the original image is seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , i.e. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor surfaces from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor surfaces from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain @-@ gra@@ b noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need details and the advanced settings of the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filter . great values increase the time the filter is measured via the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ thes and therefore minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ per @-@ level . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter according to the front panel . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details may not get more and noise or lubrication can occur .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it can &apos;t occur at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the light tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings can not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color toler@@ ability of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details pane .
gamma : controls the tolerance int@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance limits of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger , but poll@@ uted also the shadow ranges .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is high , the rough@@ ness and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur in the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
save and shop : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for noise reduction you have set , can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how cra@@ cks can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the pre@@ dat@@ ory reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too big for your purpose . the solution to disc@@ lose the image a little soft , it &apos;s easier than a painting with the menu entry correct soft@@ ness and experiment with the sm@@ ooth@@ paste on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo file .
this filters for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s Rau@@ schen , Film @-@ kör@@ ú@@ t , Cr@@ ater , Kom@@ at@@ ters , Kom@@ at@@ zer , and subsequent digit@@ alized images in digital , original or subsequent digital images as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm is used for colour and tex@@ turing . the text is developed with another tool that was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that are un@@ compressed in un@@ compressed image . this setting is correct to correct this problem .
buttons Save as and store are exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast when working . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after it . therefore , you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure .
here you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ ered cat@@ ches . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and that is corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which have been viewed by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Hot@@ pixels are allowed to remove Hot@@ pixels of photos that were using a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ NA@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw material , as many cameras with JPEG compression above have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ ot . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark picture . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image review .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . please note that the wiz@@ ard is the last dark picture , and automatically re@@ loads this in the next session .
the picture area and preview help you correct within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all demonstrations .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the following filters available :
Dur@@ ham : it &apos;s an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction in a colour photo , resulting from a faul@@ ty digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ ungs@@ correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ables , i.e. the exposed corners to correct the image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium sized and large photo format , you can frequent the entire sensor area not even@@ ly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective clearly show this behavior .
but it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 when it is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should be possible , also with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects are created by motion .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and colour scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation to a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three reg@@ im@@ ents , you can control the correction @-@ correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target device .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light output at the point of the highest density . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ate an optical filter with a aperture of 1 , or random@@ ly compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vign@@ et@@ rics .
leu@@ k@@ starch , contrast and gamma at@@ titudes : the editing of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ ungs@@ correction decre@@ ases the light intensity of the pixel . they have to adjust only positive values , because you have to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine re @-@ adjustment of the target image , so let the values for light intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the v@@ ot@@ ation correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ imp@@ ke@@ - und contra@@ sting correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; len@@ tic@@ ular distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ der does the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third ridge has a similar round effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of code correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second gradient . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical distortion is almost eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular distortion and beneficial values of col@@ lu@@ ous distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion @-@ fourth degree . this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter had the default character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value is sc@@ aled down the image size and thereby emphasi@@ zing the first gradient . negative values enlarge positive the image while positive .
brigh@@ tly : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correct . the values are stored for your image and use the default value as default .
the t@@ onn@@ - or ci@@ ch@@ ann@@ ular correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or magn@@ itude changes . best perform this correction as all first through . if you cut a picture , and then a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular correction might be the effect immediately .
to help you find the best correction to find you this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to a key place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your image , and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . in connection , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ - / c@@ ler@@ ical distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a col@@ lu@@ de distortion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove this with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular correction comes from the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared feature of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infrar@@ ed film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview . when you move the red rectangle with your mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film @-@ gra@@ ze and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the grain size of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of movie gra@@ ins and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter channels are mixed with infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming effect on a land photo made of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the leading lights .
the digi@@ plug ; filters film tra@@ der is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer great silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the movie gra@@ ins gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated photo gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere of loose daily life . if you want to get this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calib@@ rated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is needed , though often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more gra@@ ins , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like a oil painting . nature pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thic@@ ker brush can be better for large pictures . smoo@@ thing or , from the other side considered , the hing@@ ed .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and that is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and glasses 17 .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; filters char@@ coal drawing used colour and intensity gra@@ dients to define a cab@@ bage sk@@ et@@ op . images whose gra@@ dients can change slowly , therefore , if you imagine , what scene you should have chosen to sk@@ et@@ op . this would be good pictures to get started .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator el@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coal @-@ label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&amp; digi@@ al ; filters engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ arch landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art work using distortion effect . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and leaves it like it is visible through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted to another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects anytime with the button closure .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art work with sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped out the picture along st@@ ern@@ ails lines run from a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Dis@@ p@@ ity : wi@@ ped the picture by rotation of the pixels to focus . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
visual acuity : to produce the image to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
movement sequences : wi@@ ches the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the infin@@ ity of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train phot@@ ovolt@@ aics , camera .
attention : the image is soft@@ ened in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream and brilliant focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and sub@@ tle light .
check @-@ in : wi@@ ped the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a random@@ ly moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the Far@@ mers in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : split the picture in rectangular cells and then created it , new features with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button closure .
the rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this makes it natural your images a native appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright algorithm .
dri@@ p size allowed to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the dri@@ p size is not automatically increased with size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the number and density of drops . fish changes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is able to keep a range of rain@@ drops . use the range of tools for example a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the range will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers turning or transform@@ ers .
photo Bub@@ ble is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image sound and the details sharp ? how can you get the missing information ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can I see the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the size of the size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is visible below .
the tool can change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to infl@@ ate the tool .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying Algorith@@ m Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the Tab@@ s New Size and are listed below :
aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is enabled , the input of the new size is retained in the image aspect of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is believed to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and load are used exactly . every single @-@ loading for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo Bub@@ ble is very fast when it makes it , but it can still take a long time and get a high CPU load after it . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ atable by taking a small color picture to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the extended image ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation .
the cutting of a photo is not only an frequently performed surgery , but also a common under@@ estimated tool to cut a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo simply by pressing the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rectangle that you will see the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . thus you can change a good overview of your photo after cutting it . you can create a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the cutting window , use the button 1 button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut out ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the Save In File menu to save the new cut @-@ out photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners to the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialog , remains in the way .
in the mold . after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the width of the width is assigned .
the tool requires a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ metres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons on the selection exist automatically horizontal or vertical .
below the dialog you can set the maximum ratio of the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool allows you to cut the settings depending on the aspect ratio ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the trimm@@ ing tool , these settings are stored as a default value in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the image and not the original picture .
help the settings of the screening help allow help to assem@@ ble your pictures better . these assist@@ ants are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . such as the third @-@ party , harmonious triangles have the possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles .
Golden middle : the golden middle is the golden middle of a variety of natural growth sm@@ iles , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus sh@@ ells or the blu@@ epr@@ ints of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , that thus used your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you assem@@ ble your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is directed by the Fib@@ on@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition of this rule is as a visually harmon@@ ic .
the Golden Center provides smoo@@ ther support lines if you get a picture . these assist@@ ants are listed below :
Golden Spir@@ ale will give you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party , the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer along the line of spir@@ als and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can turn in the centre of the composition . it can be one line or different objects . this is simply just as being without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles have also deri@@ ve from the above @-@ mentioned gold spiral . her ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles have no equivalent triangles . Diagonal to place these lines can be transformed into a static object dynam@@ ically .
if you are using golden triangles to create your frame , create a effect of professional photographic dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your picture focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sub@@ divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which the things rot@@ ated with an angle . you can select this using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Edit free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown above .
at your help , the module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inting to position the two lines . after you can fix it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you &apos;ve turned an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function of transform@@ ers cutting them from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ic transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left at top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective the image is slightly dirty . this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
once you have adapted the perspective , you will have un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some this is the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
the lock tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction to post@@ p@@ one and the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module using transform@@ ers .
shoot your picture by using the horizontal corners and vertical corners . you can display horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you indicate pre@@ adjustments , the angle will be displayed to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right from the preview pane .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , like the Lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the shot , the image is usually neg@@ lig@@ ible . for a single layer , this effect is mostly neg@@ lig@@ ible , but two sh@@ ells is dou@@ bling much more fru@@ str@@ ation , and therefore , you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the picture has the beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats and , in some cases , by type such libraries comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will have a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of this depen@@ dency of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on its system , but they are always JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats . this happens based on the file extension and by comparison with a pre@@ defined list . if the expansion is specified in the list , you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even choose to use the format that can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss @-@ free if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can further convert resource format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration , you can further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of rough images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is available in &amp; digi@@ plug . all supporting cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials which are supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; however , this formats will be able to display or edit them . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; it &apos;s not a movie file to display movies to play the program for playback on playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module exported a number of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth format .
if you &apos;re doing the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the white pattern .
many tools that you need the photo processing are available in &amp; digi@@ plug ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ly signs , cat@@ ching , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform di@@ alog@@ ical type that shows the effect on the current picture . below , see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress shows the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of him , five buttons allow the comparative mode of the area to change . these modes are :
vertically parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and right pane showing the filter on the right of the selected area .
horizontally parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper range shows the original and the lower range of the filter on the area below the selected area .
share vertically . the left pane displays the original and right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontally parts . the upper range shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if your mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch to show over@@ - and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose a preview . you can move this context with the mouse within the picture and place on the part of the picture above that you see a preview in the left part of the dialog is updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here &apos;s a help and possibility to res@@ etting all buttons on your default values . all adjustment of the last use of the module are noted .
the Charac@@ ter@@ istics tab displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely identi@@ fi@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider puts an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can zoom out or pull it out with the mouse wheel . move Ctrl ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is naturally occurring all your pictures Geo data .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and using colors .
the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined colors and last used colours .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the colour is described below the pallet view . here also the colour name can be changed .
it can also be used to el@@ ect . to create a variety of color , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button colour , the colour is inserted from the color panel on cur@@ sor . the colour will be inserted or over@@ writes any other ; depending if the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by clicking the check box below at the C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copy , cut and inser@@ tion .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the Sh@@ ares of Red , Green and Blue and an optional colour name , followed by a row @-@ end characters . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ;

select a color somewhere on the screen and then click on the left side on the left .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . before , there are no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that include &amp; graph ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; easy ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph is re@@ calcul@@ ates and in &amp; graph ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; graph ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
from large graph ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than those no@@ des )
another required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s is required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graphic ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file , and the ( empty ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed , if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zoom is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum cr@@ ushing of a graph .
if the file has straight in &amp; graph ; uploaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ign@@ ore the change or if you want to ign@@ ore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings . please do not use , see also .
if you can open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; inter@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; b @-@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to display the already running graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also can change with the setup dialog .
in the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which should be adjusted on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages , graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page renewal shop provides the possibility to specify the behaviour of a file on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can re@@ load a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ign@@ ore the program ) or the program every time .
the page opens the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; graph ; as a graph is opened outside a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( or in a window of the already existing session ) or determine that every time is required .
the page seat administration gives you the possibility to determine the starting behavior of &amp; graph ; you can open a default behavior ( or not ) or determine if needed at any start .
the context menu that usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for moving graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historically represent@@ ations of stra@@ igh@@ tened graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ sealed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the diving model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ K@@ aw@@ ai algorithm uses the equivalent of statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ inging model layout . it uses the fru@@ str@@ man Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ step trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des in a form of six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyc@@ lical structures .
then opens a dialog box where you can specify a layout file that is executed by a shell . this command should give you a graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format , and change the calculated layout of graph@@ s , or change the graph with a filter , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or executed ) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ sealed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to immer@@ se new pictures and added these images .
this module can be used to immer@@ se new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports images by the s@@ ane project or another source like video streams . this works , you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
if you can open the menu entry images , a dialog box that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace your desired standard duc@@ tors to select your picture according to your needs . see the image size below . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower right corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window will be displayed completely because some settings otherwise may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target device . please remember that the type BMP cannot be compressed and therefore very large files . you will also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; to create or create the image .
pictures can be selected after you have selected in the Imp@@ or@@ stan@@ - &gt; screenshot of the menu . a window appears in which you can set different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete Desktop , to insert a single window under the mouse .
if all of the program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can read different screens and windows . otherwise you will read different screen settings . if you have read the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long displays will wait until it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time .
after the screenshot of the image , the dialog of the target image comes with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit in the met@@ adata of a picture . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , using GPS and Galileo are used to loc@@ alize high altitude , longitudinal and l@@ atitude .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track using XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . in order to upload a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you will have to upload a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization . this file contains the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore must be converted to GMT using the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the deviation for maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera age . the deviation is below the data collected . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a trace data from one place , you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the difference difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related to all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t know that in reality a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS , you can use these limits and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set manually if you have done a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog you need to use a number of photos on the same place , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and found with the displayed map and increase it . select this always through , until you have reached an enrich@@ ing accuracy . the map must always be manually selected . the map can be switched between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums created as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to facilitate the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen to choose the settings . you need to select all albums that are exported to HTML . you need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , it will appear on the right page and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely explained . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . choose a folder from the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard colour depth . of course , the file size is also expl@@ ain@@ able .
the rider template pictures allows you to display some of the settings from the album rider , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progressive window shows the user to how far the action is . press down@@ stairs to break the process .
if the module has produced pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program reports to determine if an error occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started to show the preview of the gallery . press Enter on the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and run on them basic operations like fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or shi@@ fting . the viewer can be used with short commands and fast access to its functions .
after launching , a picture will be displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save pictures listed in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is the size of the file size because no comp@@ ressing of the color information takes place . this can be found in P@@ NG format too .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool to combine your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams .
with the import function of the met@@ adata module you can copy the data from a picture to another . then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target picture dialog , so you want to copy the image dialog . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function is not working with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . please look at ex@@ i@@ v2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG code is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a Di@@ v .
the MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert selected images . you can also add a basic image file between the individual pictures you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size of the video format . additionally , you can use a background color for your DVD . with this module it is possible to burn the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first be packed into the pictures that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can start the module through ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should be able to customize the other settings . if you are planning the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds . the speed of the image will be specified . a low value produces very su@@ dden , a high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep it possible as if possible .
if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , you can start the movie into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly , or enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the Di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again .
if a hint appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below button settings .
the print assistant allows you to print several pictures on a paper paper together with standard phot@@ og@@ red@@ dish . this is also possible to print directly with image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to print or print using the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert any images stored in one RAW format to JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him does not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
first , select the RAW file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to adjust the conversion process . the key parameters like gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re happy with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ proof algorithm and produce the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and use the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to process your pictures frequently , or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before changing the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep original data .
if you choose to JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can cancel this process .
the stap@@ ling mode allows you to convert various images to one time . if you are sure , for example , use a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , this is helpful , however , to write existing file automatically . this is helpful , if this is not available in an earlier trial . a preview of progress is not available as far as the conversion .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , starting from the starting point and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the module .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal magn@@ itude in a dimension . width or height of the image will automatically be selected , depending on the aspect ratio , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 d@@ . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : not propor@@ tioned size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
pre @-@ preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user may set pressure resolution and size of the photo screen . the target picture , including back@@ size , edge size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to draw the size of the additional images before . further pictures can be taken on the list of attractive pictures and place there .
after you started the module , the picture window will be displayed by you . add a file selection dialog . you can add additional images with a file selection dialog . for the last updated image the picture is displayed on the right side .
you can also draw pictures on the list of images and add them to the list of images .
the selected images are removed from the list of attractive pictures from the list of pictures .
after you have selected all images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients here . you can only add the addresses and the bedding . the pictures selected from you are already attached as an app@@ endix .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails . it may possibly send a good idea to send several emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration will be saved and ever used until you modify it .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file the comments to the images are joined together in a text file and teach the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted below the loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you don &apos;t need to have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
when you select JPEG pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to sen@@ ing images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so that your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . your e @-@ mail program is automatically set up at the end . you can connect this window ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions such as you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation also use Open@@ GL by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graph card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left @-@ hand corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then break manually with Es@@ c .
the option photographs random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in random order , so the sequence of pictures are not used in the album .
under delay between the images , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual pictures are set . 1500 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should get out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects between images a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top left screen . move your mouse to this corner by you .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au .
on the lower edge screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the whole number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ men@@ id , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have got your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with a photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , so in people , places and in group keyword entries are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder &apos;s folder on your hard drive and , of course , look at the current preview models .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser doesn &apos;t change . see picture .
if you want to select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images to a few thousand images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view images of your effectiveness .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of its name . you can save with a photo@@ album , but also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined itself . see the picture .
to view images beside the name , select the button that can be set on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view of each category as symbols of persons and at the same time you can display a list of keyword ( if you do not own suitable images ) .
you don &apos;t have to specify the image for each individual person . to view this , you &apos;ll need to view the picture @-@ out window ( in closer ) and select the image for the respective person . in the setup window you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes , which will be displayed and cut off respectively .
if you are looking for entry in the main window , a dialogue is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for creating the image features very similar . this dialog allows you to view the picture once again .
if you want to enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description , the labelling and descriptions of images are searched for this text , i.e. the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data as for example 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures after specific name , as you can see in the picture . here is pictures , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather like functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and check out the quick@@ enter , the image files and introduction videos .
start &amp; Play on a photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog box , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry on photo@@ album ; - Demo . a few example will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you &apos;ll find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this cor@@ k@@ est see here : . as the name suggests , this cor@@ ps shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display you several different time units . each glue will then switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the vest only 10 minutes .
the time bar can be interactive in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date ) and also shows the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview View .
you can also select a section of the time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the timet@@ able for you . if you select a range , you can select the selection . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; photo@@ album ; presents you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , it is described in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create about the HTML file ...
before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are sub@@ divided into the three areas of contents , layout and target . in the following , every area will be more accurately described .
first enter the title of the square and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example @-@ pages see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; phone album and export file should be created , which is to be seen on the review page . do information about export files you will find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages which can be displayed without description that all images are exported without description . please note that all images are exported without description . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain consider@@ ations .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages look like . most adjustment possibilities are clear , so this is not specially formulated .
at the bottom of this page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution of 800x600 , no pictures , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
viewing your site can change the resolution at any time . it can thus change your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it &apos;s a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
at the best , choose a basic folder for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new folder .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and then automatically updated to all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check whether this really can select a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL , which can be set here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created you do not have in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it manually . in order to specify the import function , please do not need to specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder where all sub @-@ folders are located .
the basic settings described can be converted every three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be set , whose name you can define into output folder .
if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; you can , of course , you may have a HTML page for viewing the images , you &apos;ll need to add a HTML page for this , then you &apos;ll have to do with a photo@@ album ; this work did not even happen again .
with &amp; photoelectric debut album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and import other images to your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file itself , whether the pictures are stored in the file , or whether you can set all images in the file , so you can pass all images . the obvious down@@ side is , however , the file size is .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file , either directly from the menu Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
a external .@@ k@@ in file sear@@ ches the images in two times . first , the pictures are not found , so the images of the URL , which you have specified in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file , is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can export to the file file Export ... .
the most important option of this dialog is if it is about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
for the Manu@@ als option , copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy the images automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images automatically for you to download the .@@ k@@ im file .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files if you want to comp@@ ress the output file .
the last option of this page is maximum size size limit . if you don &apos;t want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can say that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and broad .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file ... select , it will import &amp; pack album as described in described .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , in which folders will be copied .
it can be that you can choose the category persons of imported file Person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is needed in your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog box , which are to be imported into the categories of imported file and correspond to these categories in your database .
in the fourth step you can offset the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , see on the picture .
it must be simple to browse pictures and watch pictures : if you see images , you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the images on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will find the various steps from the ( 1 ) place of information about your images , through ( 2 ) the sear@@ ches and pres@@ tige , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ ting possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was begun as a program for managing your images . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , about pictures are spoken , but frequently it closes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all his images in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a disk@@ ette or re@@ visions in CV@@ S where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; noted the folder where your images are saved and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start a different folder with images , you can start a different folder with images , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings of the photoelectric debut album , you &apos;ll get to a window where you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual you will discuss the various setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call Settings options and options for viewing the viewer . for every adjustment you can open a detailed help on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
this is described you as you can set for each image various features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups already existing groups . for every existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one medi@@ as .
in view of the installation options you want to configure the membership groups . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . Click on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the modules and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules can have a help page you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with several applications , it can be used to test the modules with a photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the command &gt; c@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I couldn &apos;t have been war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules work with &amp; photoelectric debut album ; not working . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this sort of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
thereby sim@@ ulates &amp; photo@@ album ; the latest album , which is just corresponds to the current view , so all images that shows you the picture preview
besides the latest album &amp; photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo@@ album ; as follows :
when &amp; photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then every entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will select the category which you have set in the settings dialog as a Category for virtual albums , so if you do not use the category people , so whether you have selected people to view this module and keep it on the module .
since some modules with a photoelectric sensor ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules and select the settings dialog , and select modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you have a photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
just like you are used by any other K@@ DE applications , you can see the window above , as you can see your image database . at the moment we will see you no more information about your pictures , but then click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the option to see any picture with comments , where the image has been added to the picture where the image has been shown separately or for a larger number of images . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depic@@ ted and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by clicking on people , locations and words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album , as you can always use it again if you want information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move of the images within the list : if you have depic@@ ted a family celebration , and on all 50 images you can see the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used names are moved up to the above , to find and arrange them faster .
if you prefer a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image separately , you may wish to edit each selected pictures and have the images with notes . Click on this case simply to the above and back buttons , which are located at the preview of the image right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . in order to indicate that it is a head@@ set , a special icon will appear .
in the context menu of the atten@@ tive dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you can sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it .
you can move the individual elements of the atten@@ tive dial@@ ogs by clicking the glue that make the upper edge of the frame , click and move them out of a frame , by moving it outside the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so on your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on button Options ... , which offers the option to save the actual design and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and here window is a / out@@ going . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will have an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of the preview window by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be decorated as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture above . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press either the edit menu or select the Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; for this problem , you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere you have saved on your hard drive . in the picture you can see the pictures of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut out , are not stored on the hard disk . this is , i.e. , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview of pictures are available , so you can see the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
just like you see this function you need to see files from the folders and then copy them back . if you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the specific CD , please do not support the inser@@ tion of your images , please get a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like a little more privacy , you can select the images so that you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister , cont@@ eu@@ ing and un@@ lock the menu entry .
thus you have set out what pictures should be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all the images that you can be locked , click to lift up the images again .
it is also possible to specify a password which has to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to order this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , everybody can read or delete all images on the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is only allowed to recover the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar with &amp; photo@@ albums ; not very familiar with the view on private pictures .
the reason why you can spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and watched over hours , of course that you want to look at some time . from this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . you can look at this preview as described in described .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional information you can enter on the picture , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture , you can also configure and configure it anywhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer &apos;s right @-@ click menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will display you all the pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . if you have selected all the pictures from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back , by using the buttons on top and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as a slide , and you can press a new picture after a few seconds . just like a new picture , you can press the Ctrl key and Plus or Min@@ us . start and stopped by pressing the Ctrl ; S .
a very useful skill of the viewer &apos;s slide @-@ album , is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can zoom in the image and zoom out . for example , you can zoom out the Plus button . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the Plus key . showing a zoom @-@ rectangle and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed , so it puts the zoom in the screen that each pixel is equivalent to the screen at a pixel screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the plus and mint paste .
you can turn the picture from the context menu . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can view notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you &apos;re looking to see images you can find a picture with a person , whose name you &apos;ve forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and follow the picture dialog to highlight this name . but they will perhaps draw the image to mark and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on paper to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start with the pictures and you can see it as good or po@@ or@@ ly mark , while being one after another .
for the two examples above you can see the possibility of view images with features , while you view it . features are the letters A to Z and you can express a characteristic that you can see the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can watch them in your browser . so , if you have selected all images you can use , print , or whatever you have any comments , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want .
categories and particularly features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in DR@@ E preview , then you can press features to the pictures by simply press the letters for the characteristic after the picture was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the ground @-@ old is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can reverse your ground later .
in a picture you can see a picture on the painted . in order to set up the painting from the context menu . in order to set up the painting from the context menu , simply click the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you have to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire @-@ color vision .
you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object as all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position to insert the object and click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry into the menu .
if possible without any possible positions , the following clip @-@ down menu will end , so you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have any properties , click on User to adopt these changes . if you have invalid values , you can send an error message with error message . then click on the input errors or disc@@ lose the modifications .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not contained in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your self @-@ view view .
press a preview of the scene @-@ view and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen texture . if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture Map ) .
screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by drag with the mouse inside the window .
each object has a power amplifier . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level of the over@@ arranged object or as absolute value . objects will be displayed only if they are selected or in the tool@@ bar chosen or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , has a window position as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical view@@ points right .
if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also save them directly . you can also switch several window orders and easily change between different orders .
to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the top to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange several views over each other , drag the touch to a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the Cart@@ ridge above in the views .
the last possible window of window are sc@@ aled views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the touch on the desktop or click the small arrow to the top left in the sei@@ z@@ ure bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross at the Beginning Bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are narrow , you can attach them to any arbit@@ rary place .
the current window view can store you with view window configuration ... save . it will display a dialog box in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be installed properly , and P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
an R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to ren@@ ame a scene in different image sizes and quality levels you can add any number of R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a fast preview up to full pictures of highest quality .
if you click on the Symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select , the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the changed image . if you want to ren@@ ew a small area of the image , select the box section and specify the image section to rendering to the input fields .
in combination box quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflective photoelectric sensor . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is reduced with only one beam each pixel . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or stu@@ cco effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam ever pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ ting the super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is always sub@@ divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray supports a beam ever pixel . if the difference between color values will be adjusted in pixels with super @-@ sampling rate , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged if you need additional beams per pixel at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference is shared between the color values the given threshold is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which can be checked separately and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the review can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the latest setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , diff@@ use reflection reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this box map , you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpected , you can find the reason here .
to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the menu entry , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported ; yet not the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support spring text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ner .
you can use objects from object @-@ tree in the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source text file into the editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree .
with copy and paste into &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can add source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click the Help button , opens &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your documentation and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. al@@ timet@@ able field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files , which do not have the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the equ@@ es for the field of view in the camera @-@ view and in the window type markings .
you can set the object cat@@ ches of points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire Model Views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling , and fil@@ ings .
greater values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects but require more time to rendering . for some objects , e.g. the ball , you can set the detail level for two directions .
when you cross high detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ to @-@ extended proj@@ ections are used , all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross floor , a floor is placed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you activate cant@@ onal release , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the rendering of scenes are used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Excel modes .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section of window orders , how to create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window rules : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
the list of Ext@@ endable window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window of window is identified by name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name indicates all the views of the selected window order . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views by the button .
the new window position . with the new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window , using cartridge card , you receive a cart@@ el side view together with the previous view and suspended the view inside the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just like &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide you should create the ultimate in simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you &apos;ll get as a result only a black screen . if you want to use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have everything f@@ law@@ lessly installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler :
take a little time to get to know the menus and using the tool@@ bar icons . read the documentation to get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will often need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select a scene without objects .
the wire model View shows how the camera looks the whole scene , which you generate . in particular , please note that the scene from the scene is from the camera &apos;s point of view . this is the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . when clicking on it , see the content of the view object properties that can be found in the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . Click on the right button and drag it to the desired position .
if you push the button or press the Enter key , the wire Model Views and the object @-@ tree immediately change these settings . as a result , see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could set a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a consistent method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , indeed , provides a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : choose the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button or press the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model indicates now also the level , if at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends up to the horiz@@ on .
if you look at the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can see the default value for every new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit in the moment .
in both cases a dialog box , where you can choose to be inserted as the object is set . please select the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ments only shows a flat @-@ black material because you have to set settings for the pigment . do so always remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . there is now many possibilities now , but take the sim@@ pl@@ est thing now .
if you don &apos;t see any color on qu@@ ader and ball , click the button on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you get your picture with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colour . you can enter two new attributes . in the color list you need two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also use this entry twice , but the box color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step is already easy to run , as you should have understood the basic operation of &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : if you don &apos;t forget to push the button on the ground . otherwise , the ball is pi@@ g on the ground , as you have to post@@ pon@@ ed the ground to a unit down@@ ward .
of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears as a matte black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can as@@ sign a material now . as already in the ground , enter the ball as color :
choose the first object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . Click on Sphere Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time , make some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following displays and click the Enter
the brightness effect and reflection result already produces good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected :
you should now have a good impression that possibilities you &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully , you &apos;ve already learned so much you can create simple scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ yc@@ ing is a pure method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene is hypo@@ the@@ tical radiation from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) by every pixel . the R@@ ender will be reflected and the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how to act as atmospheric effects like m@@ ists . so the scene is being processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see you without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , you &apos;ll find nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have to create with &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
always , if you open a new model , or create the file in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it &apos;s a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
show@@ cases the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only then select if you don &apos;t have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last changed command . this menu entry can only then select when you use editing .
save the current window direction and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing setup .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cut , and the default behavior .
opens a dialog box to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to this option .
opens a dialog for Device tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is an option to mod@@ ulate rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies . these models will continue to be processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser which allows you to view images .
images can be displayed either in a own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the usage of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or key return .
you can adjust if any picture is displayed in a own window or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . when a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three , General and machining and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ball show ; in the two others , Short@@ cuts for the browser window and Short@@ cuts for the browser , you can set the key short@@ cuts for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust below . default is no full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already look at the next picture in the folder , while you are still looking for the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
this option stores &amp; ball show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show opens this folder in browser window .
Click on the colored beams to select a background color . if in window mode , the window is larger than the image is larger than the picture is filled with the selected color .
you can setup &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so , only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window extends to the full screen for larger images . this option is switched on .
select whether the slideshow is to start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period between the image changes in slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they change from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
Click here the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ball show ; in the box cards short commands for the display window and Short@@ cuts for the browser .
with this option , switch between the second @-@ part of the file system ( a window for files and a window for files ) and one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in brief outline .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in brief outline .
displays th@@ umb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in brief outline .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means users and developers can help one another . if you are interested in questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , you should hope to be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the Developer &apos;s mailing list . guide to join the Developer &apos;s mailing list &amp; show@@ photo ;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings menu ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is selected when the sub@@ or or over@@ exposure dict@@ ator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ness should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not power more than scan and bus@@ cu@@ ers .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and draw images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for storing images or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your sc@@ anners on the s@@ ane project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projected ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; when this scanner is not opened , or if any standard scanner is specified , then a dialog box will be opened to selecting the scanner .
the user can press the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; drop scanner ; end .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle this options especially .
in order to get a picture , the user can start a preview can start and then search scanning area for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started through the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom out in and out of the current selection zo@@ oming . it can adjust the zoom again so that the complete preview can be found in the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
when storing a preview is selected in the settings , the image is stored in a preview window , shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? EN leads to a break and you come back into the main window .
clicking button settings will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before storing . in this case , the option must display a preview before storing the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the species such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images saves you . dialog for each image opens the dialog box before each image file , then you need to save them without any file name defined in a previously defined folder .
this setting defined where the images are saved from the Save In option , where the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be saved as default for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storage images and is also counted in addition to the proposed name for the image stored in the dialog . the automatically stored image will be saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality image quality . this value also changes the compression value during storage . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ el@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs of the keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and to select the Global button of button , click on the right button of button and click the button of the button to click on the player window and select short commands ...
you can possibly create existing Multimedia keys so they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts . therefore , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok hasn &apos;t added some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing dependence on whether all necessary modules are available and use the dialog , making the user identification , why a script is not running .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; in Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; the dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; , exit
in the folder scripts / templates you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or just to expand the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing by scripts relative is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data using Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called upon this way . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are continuously used to monitor the default of scripts and respond accordingly to events . of course , one script can ign@@ ore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and loading the setup data every script must take care of every script . if a script is started , amar@@ ok is saved the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece could be played . the script might en@@ quire &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ COP functions more information about the new piece ( for example , met@@ adata or piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ menu : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ aking : sub@@ menu contains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a custom menu item can be used to remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ ability Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ eral ) to remove the script .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok is finished , or if the user can stop a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be processed to the script . this signal should be processed for example , for example , store data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ante Script management can also install Script packages which can be compressed to the user &amp; z@@ B ; which can optionally be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also recognize the archive clearly than Amar@@ ok @-@ script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 Only accept script packages using the extension of the cat@@ amar@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and get the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily move music into the play@@ list instead of endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a completely specific title of thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have a few play@@ lists , however , you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then , the play@@ lists is still difficult to choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ H@@ IF@@ P and many generic USB devices , so that you can listen to many different audio systems such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to experience your music !
usually you have to set up the Fol@@ lowing folder of the Amar@@ ok @-@ Sour@@ ces to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used when comp@@ ile no difficulties if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; just like most applications , how to activate or disable the compilation @-@ time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled which they can be used . for details , please refer to the system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort across the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
the Player window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window is displayed .
voice activity : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
tuning : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , the used colour scheme for the voting activity is altered .
tune files to the music files : this function is only available when it is activated . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files at the memory location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : allows you to choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when a browser is required .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list below .
play@@ list when storing , stores the current play@@ list automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the play@@ list when moving .
relative paths for manual play@@ list : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , run from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved .
the game changes will be reflected in the piece of pieces that the play@@ list window will keep up / roll@@ out to keep the current piece always in the visible window sector .
automatically switch to the context @-@ browser @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser once the next piece is played .
in the published section you can customize Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the otherwise grey fonts will be activated . you can select the fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context @-@ browser . press on Aus@@ sie ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of customized color scheme , you can define the qu@@ el of choice and you can define your own color scheme . for this , use the color cho@@ ices for front and background colour .
playback at the start shows that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically begins with the piece at the place where they stopped working .
the sub @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from the dialog box to select the font type for the O@@ SD . the check box can be displayed in the O@@ SD .
our own colours gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if exist@@ ent colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the Display @-@ Text displays the text displayed in O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you can find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen &apos;s option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can define , on which screen of a multi @-@ way monitor environment is to appear on the O@@ SD .
the box map audio output allows you to select a audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the map material collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which should browse &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to include a folder in the collection with its name , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains cross boxes to adjust , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder well : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders to music are well known .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to perform the necessary modifications at your collection .
play@@ lists import : results that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection , then re @-@ added play@@ lists later appear in the play@@ lists .
the part of collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , you need further setup in the MySQL installation .
the MySQL database is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calculator , the machine port is set to which the MySQL database is entered under the database . name : is the Database name , which is made to the connection .
use username : and password : to insert the data required for the connection to the database .
the card card load reli@@ .@@ f@@ m set the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create the need for music recommendations regarding the current product .
here you can enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
update down pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be shown in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need any last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . please find further information in summary of the functions and gallery with images .
Amar@@ ok only requires the package k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and none other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ del@@ ib@@ s ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be found ( e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to k@@ del@@ ib@@ s minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD dep@@ loy that your window manager will work with fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably you can see a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can notice this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ Developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file again and create the collection again .
mostly , it is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ Developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try to try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it is in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more sophisticated .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to desc@@ end while editing the Meta information .
if you are using K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable it automatically if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically check with a crash ) and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 into the Meta @-@ Info , but this is not a Unicode character . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l called &quot; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ rors when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status de@@ activ@@ ates on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ ok the correct Q@@ t library . you can see it with LD@@ D &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t @-@ version or delete / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf that Amar@@ ok the right version .
there are some options . most installation problems clari@@ fy the lightest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or at developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under irc@@ um@@ ode@@ .net in Channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please note there just one error if you &apos;re at a bug of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after launching &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list . how do music pieces go into there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to intuitive the surface , the Start window will be converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of this symbol has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , you need to display the evaluation lock in the play@@ list . Click here to see the list of the play@@ list and select column . Click here to set up the new evaluation column . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press the f on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select From play@@ list menu .
draw a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them go there , exactly as you would also do it with other files . that &apos;s easy : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , you &apos;ll find the button play@@ list . Click on it .
presum@@ ably you &apos;ll have the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el program and install Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ qualizer can be found in the context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar under the ex@@ tras ...
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; U@@ sed one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence , the real question are : what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it can be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with default settings are not supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , interference
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s starting from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . it enables multiple applications to use the device to use and simultaneously . this can be achieved using a sound@@ card with hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem watch and a solution . you need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this is done &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first have to be coded for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer will read the file , de@@ coded and transm@@ its the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can display directly to AL@@ SA , exactly like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see the next Point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause dis@@ rup@@ ted playback . read this error message in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either use the Arts driver , but instead of track or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presum@@ ably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less jobs react , please help us to resolve it .
track is installed but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform g@@ ings register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ n@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute g@@ st register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP , it is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the playback start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll have stopped off the soft tones of music , which you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running the current title if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH @-@ environment is available , you can proceed as follows : here , here you can interpre@@ t and title the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ here
replace IP address with your IP and username user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window will be separated . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of Ctrl + right mouse button provides a piece in the cli@@ ffs for the qu@@ eu@@ e . by pressing the Enter on the play@@ list , the first search results will be played and the search ref@@ unded .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ ily functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
Click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser will be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is based on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can &apos;t be created and appear on the console many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; works not with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on Audio CD to play . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal view , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or Window . to automatically , take files from folders mp3 or OGG .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more influence has played , the less influence has the overall score .
you can define the evaluation for a piece itself , by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . then you can select the evaluation of a piece button as well as all other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the met@@ adata dialog .
the developers would not want to publish you , when you have a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan which cannot be met with the short @-@ term designed plan by Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find sli@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service on the information which will be played on an independent server . service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please install the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of abst@@ rac@@ ts and thereby causes a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you have to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .

this opens a dialog window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administrators must be required for system administrators ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here , the settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on time . this dialog is intended for Person@@ alize and Fine @-@ Adjust@@ ment of the Program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with one &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the function scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which gives you the accompanying program .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions you need to make sure &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and then enter something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program gem@@ s , support &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ aux @-@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mix@@ ed@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ z@@ no@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ z@@ v@@ d ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ z@@ v@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ .d@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ .d@@ vd@@ media ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ .d@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ .d@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X project method , one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ ativ can change a reference on the project by using the # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through Use of this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) vo@@ id add@@ ur@@ ine ( Q@@ String path ) vo@@ id ren@@ dition ( Q@@ String path ) vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) vo@@ id @-@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) vo@@ id @-@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / home / tru@@ eg / she@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ de ; with it easy audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD files on the hard drive ) and by many co@@ di@@ ers that supports these WAV files ( without any loss@@ less compression ) . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
will comp@@ ress these WAV files in a second step ( usually a pro title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , advertisement ( for MP3 ) , og@@ b@@ la@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already exist , so it &apos;s probably not necessary to comp@@ ile any Linux distri@@ butions . however , it is not necessary to be needed too . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which code / file format should be used ? the chapter of Wel@@ ser Co@@ di@@ ers provides a small introduction on co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality , and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , U@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to read any copy protection . if not the firmware of the copy protection is not possible . avoid the purchase of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only one must be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , will follow the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the sl@@ ender approach of user interface , which you will often be stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending of which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can use &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work fully without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example , you will find further information , such as this program is used as well as monitors with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case first must first be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the header settings in the setup mode - encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it &apos;s note that the encoder &apos;s encoder settings can be configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a file extension is selected to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and to en@@ code .
opens the configuration dialog to configure the messages of messages ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ ves ) for events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set en@@ coders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , encoding and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right coefficient .
if no audio information should be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among audio formats , which lose information through data compression , depending on your psycho@@ acou@@ sti@@ cal model , MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , however , the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not as &apos; free , lame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG chi@@ pper is available .
MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices not only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame &apos; help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This adjustment should usually provide for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex tracks . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments without having to view the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or transferred by the Free@@ DB program via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with co @-@ encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the lit@@ ters ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database in which people can read / enter the information you can enter in the calculator so that all the other information can be entered into the calculator below : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( an@@ m of the translation ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent the public on &amp; CD ; it &apos;s not permitted to be added to the artist or CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the artists can still be associated with a B@@ um@@ mel . all information can be obtained from a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; actively use a check box ( sending an address ) to the use of Free@@ DB . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the server ( this can only know the programmer , which has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when you use Free@@ DB , ge@@ ographic will be used to use Free@@ DB . this saves bandwidth in the network and res@@ embles the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done .
to save the retri@@ eved WAV files , the co@@ di@@ erer can be chosen to select the desired file format . at the first opening , there are pre@@ defined entries for advertisement ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before using the co@@ di@@ erer . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter of Space Co@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co@@ di@@ ers , more information about his switch may be obtained through the input of a command like lame @-@ help or lame @-@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . in this case , &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives which are installed and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to access both programs with a command line in one terminal . this might provide a hint of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope der &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter of step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , but are somehow un@@ sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will need enough information to configure the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , we will start everything and our first &amp; CD ; read the &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile what you can do naturally .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the context ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something of which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; , which has to be repeated for every inform@@ ing &amp; CD .
here we define the use of encoding for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . as we are f@@ au@@ l , we divide the program to use the Free@@ DB to download the Free@@ DB file .
although we can change these settings anytime , we will probably not be found at any reading of a &amp; CD , if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read it &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running process . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , so it can also display the effective device identification number if available in the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card Card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here you can get an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be shown / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only for in@@ complete information you can select , so you will be informed when the information is missing from sampling ( tags ) .
the card box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to download data via the internet from a Free@@ DB calculator .
note : the calculator must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet that it can access the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , comm@@ itting immediately the database name / file name or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory entry / file name will be changed easily and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ging .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter the list box and Free@@ DB . you can use Free@@ DB locally in off @-@ line mode , if you want to use the database before . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . in mode the mode will be set up on the following cardboard box .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server to the Internet . how does the system that data will get the CD ? read the details about Free@@ DB . read everything as shown in the screenshot of the screen .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your neighborhood . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts and this setting will work as the first attempt .
both don &apos;t work on the server , as many Fire@@ walls will bo@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data on the Free@@ DB server . you should disable the first check box .
simply take the settings of the screenshot . ( put sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer )
number of simultaneously demonstr@@ ating pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? do reading and code reading ? the author knows not to try yourself .
CD . after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are checked , then the path / folders can be specified in which the WAV files can be stored . if only space is not checked , the files will not be checked if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything is set like it on the screenshot one . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something to the right must be sm@@ iles to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the combined compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be en@@ code simultaneously .
this is , we just have the basic set of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as default for every reading of a &amp; CD ; when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section is described , as described as the process of reading &amp; CD ; it is set up on the hard drive . we will build a link to the Internet , as we are conveniently and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB to pick up . the process of this file is described in this section , must be repeated for every inform@@ ing &amp; CD .
since we do not include a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ DB , the screen saver contains a little bit different from Free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eve it from the Internet . comments will refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be defined ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen saver , this only if the &amp; CD can be identified as audio CD ; identified and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this is not happening , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully collected from the Free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces have already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case that it &apos;s more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of Free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ) , you can manually trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need to connect the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen in the first line of the &apos; Aktu@@ ell &apos; title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the input field &apos; Update &apos; , unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply for all CD &apos;s pieces .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from Free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to review the content of the CD Ed@@ itors ( e.g. all words with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restric@@ ts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comment , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag , you have set an unlimited field of field settings ; this option will have a look inside the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the Help to receive more information .
simply select an entry , which obviously is wrong with the style of the Next CD ; this is not important because we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for further information , please refer to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . Click on the line with the second piece .
the Windows @-@ editor window appears and you see that the fields are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . enter the entries for the current piece . specify the title of the piece on each case and other information you wish .
Click on the next row in the main window and proceed to the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list .
note that it has a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the tracks are selected . simply click on the line to select all the pieces , or enter the button all the pieces on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
if clicking on the button selection read the read process , this window appears to confirm . on OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what it expi@@ res .
Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you write write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear how the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece that it is finished . but we have completed a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and en@@ code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program does not have any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour is the result of parallel processes for reading and en@@ code . with an AM@@ D@@ 64 , no problem appears at the same time to read and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the qu@@ eu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last number is coded , a small window will be coded for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ partial or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the amount of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; if you are familiar with CV@@ S ; the most distri@@ butions do not include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audit@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is aimed at individuals who comp@@ ile the source files and not intended for users to use the pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for searching for your needs such as the program can be adjusted once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variants of settings . best reading the step by step example to get the options and settings . it displays images of different card cards settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked out of the program without any point of view such as it should go from this somehow empty screen ( above all if the program starts at the time of the program boot ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what about it ? who reads this , probably the program has started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no E @-@ Mail . the author cannot add this hand@@ book . it is the first version to add or modify it . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this section , it has agreed to this section and therefore agree with this sugges@@ tion .

supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , where you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with multiple songs .
to play a piece of music , open it and connect the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu or enter the Le@@ ap@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succes@@ sively . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece play , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of speed indicator . to get back the original temp@@ o , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ap@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause , or the selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , then interrup@@ ts the play . put the spac@@ eb@@ ar off while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text ex@@ propri@@ ation , others use songs ex@@ haus@@ tion and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the E@@ rection type will be automatically determined which you need to manually adjust the Karaoke text . but they still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an er@@ ec@@ st@@ al type , select from the menu Settings menu entries and songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are the range after ab@@ bey . in this section , how you can use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired output in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns that you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to add a song . it appears in the file dialog with its help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically to the active collection .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and activated . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and desired tune then click here .
you can choose the sequence in which the songs can be played . if you choose the menu from the menus sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or choose songs or accid@@ ental sequence in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the Next button next song , next song , or press the arrow po@@ inting right .
to jump back a song , select the button @-@ predic@@ t piece , the entry pre@@ defined piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the del@@ eting collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus , whenever a trumpet should play a piano .
if you just have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl. AW@@ E and CIS cards , FM @-@ Devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the respective file by hand ( with your favourite card ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications for playing a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ...
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail to which I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , how the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the par@@ c character is igno@@ red . it is assumed that GM &apos;s patches must not change in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to insert all sounds which support this instrument to the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can have a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which have the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a patch with Patch 127 ( def@@ ensive ) , it accepts Patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which audio is encoded in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , if any sound is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the tone pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use :
like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P paragraph , the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and any instrument . you have to use different key@@ maps only in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to train sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . watch as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to rep@@ licate some channels on others . if you want to de@@ bit the first and second channel , simply make it easy in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a designated channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section , thus 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
this is the channel , which is used on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must naturally use the name name for this channel . if you try to modify the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the per@@ imeter @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event . if so , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only forwarded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to do not dec@@ im@@ al@@ komm@@ as in the Map file .
this setting is needed because GM is pre@@ defined that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event . unfortunately , some key@@ boards can play with two sounds up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use an MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog box MIDI settings . you can find in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the channel screen is a window with an entire pi@@ v@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see what sounds are played .
you can also use the Channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed one instrument , if you have changed one instrument , the button does not have more green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the played tones . view the view menu settings under the point of Channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a music piece must be played . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force any@@ body , &amp; k@@ mid ; but you need a similar sound quality . but a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you need a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything .
this may happen if you have compiled a binary @-@ distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
enable to activate the Automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files for temporary collection will be added .
you can switch the buttons on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve got on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a Karaoke file , or if I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window , and draw the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without them to add to a collection , turn the setting automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of files
let us take you , you have the MIDI Files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. just want to play the first file . so , set the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then join forces to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies , I &apos;ve tried to collect MIDI files , music and propositions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to contact me a postcard or a MIDI file , then you should get in contact with me , as I have already heard the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my free time and by ni@@ eman@@ ate money . I would therefore want to program it only because / if I receive feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the defect that the pitch was high at AW@@ E cards .

one sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality is considerably dependent on your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed for playing video files by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ Baroque windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a window window that is displayed only if information is returned to it .
it is possible to remove the preferred compounds under the menu book@@ marks , but this is individual entries . if you want to play a list of entries , you should use the thum@@ b play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical step . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ sets will be copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ b play@@ list can also be modified by direct editing of XML configuration files , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ des , from the menu View and next editing mode . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu with play@@ list and select either the processor mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can be turned on enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ verse option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ec@@ .x@@ ml / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start@@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end by opening a different source . however , this would be dis@@ ast@@ rous at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore stop the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G = &apos; in@@ defin@@ ite ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; In the source package of &amp; cr@@ m@@ player ; they are supported by S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar from k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ oth .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing by the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted a special field in the play@@ list XML in the play@@ list .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a consoles and post error messages for loading the browser Module library . if no errors occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ determined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will return all OGG files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , it can be configured to used device and TV channels . to this , the scanner can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box can be detected in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB inside .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video ( presum@@ ably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , this will also be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , from KM@@ Player to sources different names are used . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , external source , interval source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ Source . if enabled , they start with playing the play@@ list .
are there any comments such as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be used as user root after mount the device . it &apos;s sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slow , why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional script application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) is accessed .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution included . the documentation of the distribution or installation @-@ CD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some pre@@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independently of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation is considered . is the support for this project or documentation , should be made contact via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
for questions or at the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; if desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; Lat@@ ex ; - Environment . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a graphical interface and within these simple , direct and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities should be experienced for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s chapter .
for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the right to use : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is also possible to use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less sophisticated yet more realistic setting is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name by Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
there is only a good view to Lat@@ ex ; but it is not the ultimate book about it . by &amp; Lat@@ ex ; properly domin@@ ate , good peti@@ tions , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

just like other labelling languages includes &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with the general characteristics such as paper format , page reproduction and text gr@@ Ã ¶ can be specified with the command \ \ document { document } and has to be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the quick @-@ asc@@ en@@ sion assistant by &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; and the selection of the document ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers a number of possibilities to create document related settings .
document classes : this is the type of document to be able to obtain the document &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , film &#91; beam &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the string . it should be used to use the encoding of the system . if necessary , the UTF @-@ 8 encoding should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the mostly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they can be used only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in creating German texts .
new users are now not wor@@ ried anymore . this is only about a brief description of the functions and further information in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; - just like other source file editors , the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) function , it is possible to notice that any mathematical environment could not be closed . however , it is possible to help you through the modest appearance of output files . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and spending .
by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the proper line to connect the command could be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . Moreover , the sub@@ division of the document contained in the following elements ( part is the most convenient and sub@@ conscious element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , single elements can be changed and viewed by a single click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; Ger@@ Ã ¤ te@@ un@@ zip file ) was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
one DVI ; file contains a description of the formatt@@ ed document and also other information like the font and is available in addition to PDF the available document of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; and there are many tools to view , transformation and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the add @-@ on search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the Editor is enclosed , and as soon as an element in the DVI / lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code would be cli@@ cked . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is scanned .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with another .@@ tex file . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is not included in this mode , and there is no calling by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be explained in the document . the first selection field has been developed for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Other is for the event of articles such as keywords , joints , notes or references . the available mo@@ tions are :
name : with this command , a name is created for one section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote is a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the file is necessary . for editing &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; bib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; files can be written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ r is used for defin@@ ing the font or the main text , the joints , notes , etc . , there are the following fonts for the author :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection committees are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and feast of settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason of hand .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . the font is not at the beginning , this can also occur in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of your building or the button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document must be searched for errors in accordance with errors . when using quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , should also be considered the log@@ ging .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { environment } can be realized .
these changes are only advis@@ able within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; to { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no damage ( number of ) changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities for extending the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added , for example , certain fonts , fatty pressure , auxiliary pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands are either connected with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; begin { scale } : this command is suitable for the short pressure and is long as long as long as being closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ stamp { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quotation in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; begin { qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; illustration of the source code , a step @-@ on @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in assist@@ ants a bit text was entered , some customiz@@ ations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . a few places in the fatty acids and a po@@ em is to be used to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document was viewed , Editor @-@ view or Ctrl E can be returned to the Editor ( with an external viewer ) editor . the window must be closed during an external viewer .
once the DVI / file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a simple file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ º ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer screen TVs .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document can be seen ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed on a file ( if the printer is properly configured ) .
the tool@@ bar adjust@@ s the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code could be created , the conversion can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the previous search allows the direct jump from the editor to the right position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . only Modern is to be align@@ ed with K@@ ile settings ... tools and equipment can be used .
to execute the pre @-@ search engine , the mouse indicator must be positioned inside a line of the source . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewing takes place .
using this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; comes with a click of the medium mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document from &amp; k@@ ile ; ready to set and to the corresponding line ; as text editor are set to set ( at@@ titudes oc@@ ulars ... editor )
if using the Quick Installation of the &amp; DVI ; Viewer cannot be specified , an error can occur . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file contains the error source in the source code . in the Editor , the buttons are always used to see the error message . in order to see the incorrec@@ t line , the log file must be cli@@ cked and k@@ ile ; jumps to def@@ ective row .
once on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the document for the document . the pre @-@ set charges are :
when choosing empty document , a document may be written either by reason of re@@ written or the assistant to rapid creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ rous User of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . you can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting the document from the document ...
when creating a new document using a new document , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in at@@ titudes and set up the settings .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which character sets of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used in this document : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { Made } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and thus verb@@ ose the instructions in the editor . as soon as the document has been created , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of the standard equipment .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the Internet and under@@ go the steps under described steps .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmer with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bib@@ tex ; ) . many at@@ titudes for &amp; Kate ; could be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to know more about &amp; Kate ; and his testimon@@ ies should be experienced for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be opened directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s chapter .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command @-@ reference which can be called for the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; you can find and their syntax .
double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the &amp; tex ; word to do . this means that in this way the click \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ or \ \ par .
when pulling the text with a well @-@ click left mouse button , the full text will be copied to the clip@@ board .
when using arrow keys with slide @-@ in button , can be selected to selected parts of the source text in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse different types of source texts and produce them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be included in the text . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this jumping brand is highlighted , or the corresponding key stamp is emphasi@@ zed , so that this jump stamp will be highlighted automatically when entering the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent powers were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing are the following commands for text selection :
these include a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contains on both sides a blank row ) . this extended meaning does not connect to tables , &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prevents thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is thus that the text is separated by two empty lines .
get the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¤ ck@@ n@@ jar ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to view a part of the document , it can be excluded from this first and can be removed by pressing the button Ent@@ f Ctrl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with his own commands for a faster mixing . under editing , the following commands are contained in the text of the text :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit phrases .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments can play a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under editing area for a great work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed right before the order to get the surrounding area .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed right behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ begin { ambient } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many cont@@ oured environment commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command allows the most recent environment , so that the sh@@ aded environment structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . among Edit Te@@ X Group are some important commands which meet the processing environment .
with this command is sung in the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the shr@@ inking K@@ lam@@ mer .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed right behind the s@@ ant@@ lers .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the s@@ ant@@ om K@@ lam@@ mer of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many dec@@ ou@@ ted groups stap@@ les can be lost , the last group can be lost , so that the last updated structure of &amp; tex ; groups cannot be dist@@ orted .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings as a tree for practical implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , the sign &quot; is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; and k@@ ile ; it knows this case and takes two close contact signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic feed @-@ up of the double features can be arranged under the settings of K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be switched on .
there are also certain specific settings ( e.g. n@@ urses or French ) and there@@ with German or French beg@@ inner characters . there are also many other languages available .
for the Shift of Shift ; input aste and k@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ates or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a row demo@@ li@@ tion but also the command \ \ item .
within a spre@@ adsheets . connect &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ score pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ score the settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; try to encourage this . even if this tab@@ ulator is impossible , it is impossible to add and k@@ ile ; according to the now@@ here , it is impossible to add the column position of the current tabl@@ ator .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers a good source text fin@@ ery , it was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly as needed ) and the other two are available for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be set for different work modes of settings ...
when starting a new environment by the command \ \ begin { ambient } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when you click the button , the last letter of the input is removed and enables the complete list of payment . on the other hand , the list may also be resi@@ zed by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , it can be easily accessed by selecting a command . alternatively , this easily jump to these positions by editing brands N@@ Ã ¤ k@@ ste jumping brand is possible and the desired parameters will be changed .
among settings ... k@@ ile ; gas@@ eous settings for these lists are made . you can find various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and arrangements of the general language used can be used .
the command mode is available for the recovery of environments not n@@ Ã ¼ . it is always used a few letters with \ \ &apos; . on the other hand , the environment is often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for processing of environments .
when proc@@ laim@@ ing the menu or the key , Alt + Shift button , the command to open the environment is automatically extended and it appears to be completed . after that , the environment can be terminated on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and will be completed by pressing the input button .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is about a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is done with .
among Settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; Complete settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the complete list of understanding mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line user @-@ defined lists of wast@@ es which can be replaced immediately by l@@ Ã ¼ r@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , which includes the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word written by using the menu or the scanning Ctrl + Alt Le@@ ap@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
far more visitors are not helpful for automatic adjustment . however , it has been noted that many w@@ ounds can be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the realization for all already written request .
this mode can be set up in men@@ Ã ¼ at@@ titudes ... K@@ ile le@@ ver@@ ing can be turned off . here , the sw@@ elling value can be specified for displaying the adjustment .
the complete editing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the personal home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( free manual ) or tex .
the dialog graphics can be arranged as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , sections should be considered and resp@@ ected .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for these changes and new orders of pages . will be able to re @-@ install the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tool@@ ing and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus , creating converting and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used via Alt ; 3 , by using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Command Express , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iling point . should not be used to build a new window , so it will be a new window .
a new project is available for the project &apos;s new project .... the following information is needed for the project :
when drawing up the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r repository .
the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the script of EC@@ MA@@ Script encoding . the scripts can be managed to manage scripts in the vertical glu@@ es .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be viewed in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; nor funds .
the first must be said that the script environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a quite protected system which enables the basic functions to be expanded by a wide variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different assist@@ ants to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; textile live ; are supplied with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete Re@@ fern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and there is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for a particular form . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with them &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; delivered , the fin@@ alization of the right document is not always easy . as possible assistance ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all @-@ to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ ati@@ able advantage is the search for parc@@ el names or perc@@ ussions ; then only the results are displayed .

to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; file specified in the &amp; XML ; files are specified in &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; schema available as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is the specification of defin@@ ite @-@ UR@@ I ; available in the file selection .
ja@@ ws probably , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library .
if the processing file was selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can already be selected , then remove the current file format . if not , remove the selection from the current file and select the file selection file format .
enter the file &apos;s name , as the result is said , the file is usually stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; might be able to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even though you can benefit from the additional functionality and you can &apos;t wait until someone is able to use the desired function &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below .
to install a Plugin or K@@ Part , we start with the Edit menu , making the following dialogue :
this dialog allows you to manage and add all included plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can set the path path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the information of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog will be configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . N@@ ick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who is happening . this is done by pressing the Team Member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will appear shortly after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitude of own identity are important in regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of its team , there is an additional advantage through the acquisition of members of the team : it can be created an event on the team manager if something particular happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions , which are executed if something of the project is happening . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , as much any@@ how to work , or a script that is saved into CV@@ S if it is added to the project , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog box can be edited , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address chosen in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , and such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it is easy to enter . it can be selected either by the Editor &apos;s Note menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a commentary area followed by text text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , being a role in the project consists of the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project managers , according to the Domain and Sub@@ project leaders , as shown in the examples below .
top name and roll names are independent of large or small characters , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and formatt@@ ing languages that supports D@@ TD @-@ saving and web@@ based formatt@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the ant@@ um ant@@ um ant@@ um ... which covers a few pages , which will be treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion may be changed . the entries are :
large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of tags : big / minor sp@@ elling of tags : normal / small sp@@ elling means that tags will be added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling attributes : large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of attributes : normal / small sp@@ elling means , the attributes are added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut down : if needed , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : how above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and closing tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic start @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ z@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding encoding during the ti@@ pp@@ le .
M@@ IME types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of various types of files . using button standard , the default setting can be recovered .
standard string coding : encoding of newly created or in other mode as with file open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be received ) , however , this setting is being loaded from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files that D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies to restore the document from this backup to the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ or@@ area or own view ( or documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source text simultaneously .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface is come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ fix command line parameter .
the warning messages range serves the possibility of controlling War@@ nings through the warning of no more in@@ qu@@ eries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in divided mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action causes it possible to change the structure button with clicking on the mouse button .
in the structure of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically during an amendment to the structure and how deep when changing the structure tree are automatically opened , empty spaces are contained in the text , while empty groups are no element found in the current document .
the area for the fixing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ locked in groups , each can be sub@@ divided into groups , each can be sub@@ divided into several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ config abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in one group is valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are used on the third side , which can be used by any part @-@ capable application , the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not on a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the Start Plugin , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folders ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is refused . only @-@ reading files is usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is properly , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , error search has been completely re@@ developed . as well as the support for the D@@ BG Debug@@ ger . instead of its , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations using plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included .
the usage of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the Options Options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables . appears usually in the left dock .
a view , in which all support points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , produced , or divided the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ bit demands . this action will be triggered by default if a project is opened , so that normally does not have to be considered .
the counter@@ piece on de@@ bug@@ ging session is the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or end the har@@ lot according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to include a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger issue .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , starting with the execution of the script and the current specified line , when this happens , when the script is done , the execution occurs when performing a de@@ bit requirement , the script starts with the requirement .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script , without any information on over@@ loaded variables and the current line number , running the execution . if this is done , the execution will be done , as soon as a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes gear @-@ to @-@ error .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to transfer the instruction and go to the next one , than there would not be the current .
opens a dialog box that can be entered into a variable or expression should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable input or a new value can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith I@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find at htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
documentation of edit pack@@ ets ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) will be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities such as device complete and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s exist in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . day folders contain two file types , the text and instructions faster into a document that might ever be one user ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for details .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; Per@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . briefly , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; self . tool bar allow for fast inser@@ tion tags in a document without risk of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are not available as folder . they contain only the &amp; Per@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders are named the names of descri@@ b@@ ulation language and version . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use other users a better look and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in one document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain only an element type over themselves .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; A argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to the method . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can be found only once for any attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is an only element type element .
specifies the source code used for the attributes in the Tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology has within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting tool and methodology . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ onal name % , this means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that is group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is an only element type element .
determines the attribute of an tags within a dialog . this day can occur only once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Day ) .
is there a list of elements that may occur within the possibility of defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
is there a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be coupled and closed .
spaces influence nothing but keep up &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window windows to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , check the verification of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the following an example of a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file shall be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; transfer function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; Per@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be easily accessed via D@@ TD . this can be processed di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ aneous lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) N@@ ick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as N@@ ick@@ name .
an action can set action with settings ... to be created . Click on New promotion to the same dialog :
this action weigh@@ ted key short@@ cuts . with clicking the button user can be assigned a ke@@ yst@@ one button ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detector settings and inserted in execution of this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that may change or as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . they are the quick start @-@ up dialog , or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
even though qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ you variable in the command line , such as sh % script@@ ase / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file is removed from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process will be replaced . if required by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be determined by default . in the selection field , input can be determined which are to be sent to default . options are :
selected text : the selected documentation is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the output can be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal edition , written to the default output ; error messages which should be specified on the default output , which is set to the default output by default :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ expl@@ aining . the New Action Kn@@ op@@ fes at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use the dialog &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; Edit menu &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if available , thus entering the operation possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represents , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a button head as a symbol . through the use of green ( green , it is mostly interpreted as a symbol ) or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alled that clicking this symbol will add a &amp; lt ; - day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still gives you , or confirm with OK to complete .
accepted , you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be shared for better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar can be selected automatically .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that is added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick possibility to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
in the right folder , save it into the right folder , but your tool bar will be saved , but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder . please fit their tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the script language or the formatt@@ ing language that you like one &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository , whether somebody has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for formatt@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you will need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . let &apos;s make the second part we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files such as ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 1 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 4.0@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 8.@@ html 2 = 30.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = day 2 html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Top level Elements Top Element , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of contents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Getting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = Soci@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # before Getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is about sub@@ folder in tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources should be replaced .
the summar@@ izing section is the field of doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to design the context @-@ sensitive help . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file command lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c as simple and as after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this well and worth are worth to be shared to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Community . you will not be rich , but proudly presented to have been working on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources may be sent by email to friends , partners , or anything else . at different places there is an email with email , tool@@ bars , tool@@ bar with email , in context menu from files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be checked and only available when our team used it as a correct and user @-@ used for the publication . to sign it a g@@ p@@ g / P@@ GP key , it is guaranteed to use a g@@ p@@ g / P@@ GP key , both for our Team as well as for later users .
when loaded , you &apos;ll be asked for their private g@@ p@@ g key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can consult a dialog . in dialogue New Resource , the input fields must be completed ( URL preview may be empty ) and then click OK .
upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menu , the tool bar can also upload files and folders in the template and scripts in the template and scripts .
after downloading a resource , or before installing , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource may be observed , and it may be broken . please note the warning messages . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , it appears with the indication of the Creator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files could be needed in tag@@ ging XML format . there is the sim@@ pler way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ Beschreibung , which shall be used as follows :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE definition line : the string that is on ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE day like HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; based on converting the &amp; Cool@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor that can be adjusted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these fundamental concepts , this chapter is trying to answer to these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by tool@@ bars , everything is selected , in which shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then stand in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements constitute a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory so that it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are integrated in the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editors , the building inten@@ tions , the building blocks , with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document entries , such as close to the current , other or all cart@@ ons , ski@@ pping or up@@ loading of the document , ski@@ p to a bookmark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Edit@@ or@@ area related to a further context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse indicator or open the file , if the string contains a file under the mouse indicator .
at the top end of the editors , the tool@@ bars of the editor are present and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional than standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool bar will be adapted to the new features and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert , then click the symbol that the tag represents , then you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill different fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to navigate and through . in the display with cardboard accounts for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building inten@@ tions are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload , or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web site &amp; etc . there are all the options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which , in which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available .
here you can find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the element , the cur@@ sor is set to the element of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and claim of the tree .
this tree appears under the other Bau@@ man@@ views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this is possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . you can download the documentation section for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the documentation site can create your own documentation , and through adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cartridges at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this box covers information about each in Quantum a running script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all modifications to the D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all the errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all the error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . showing the corresponding command . the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; if it &apos;s a tool bar , you can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like every other in@@ secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . to get a complete list of options that can be passed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before it bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while effort to create the best &amp; HTML , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an exceptional idea : what would be when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , this would make him absolutely great Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . summarized , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should download &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; suitable for suitable &amp; IDE .
now , to the above requirement must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so as to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can boost productivity almost every task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting , scripts and tool bar , the automation can boost it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be saved without any script language call . ( more about it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was developed for a quick web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information about the documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ um ) .

a quick release list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not found on it , with the oldest entry .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project @-@ deposit folder , only one error is reported .
converted to inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board , contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; notes , so they are correctly displayed and not understood by the browser as formatt@@ ing instruction .
converts the text from clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; repair , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . in the first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anch@@ ors day .
switches the block selection or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button to select button .
goes directly to a row number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be found !
seek a string or regular expression in selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
compensation and switching on the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window will be activated once you switch to structure tree .
shows the icons from the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks using a single click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries preceding or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents published in the menu , group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
a existing project from Hard Drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ tion files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searched out the project directory for new files that could be there . that enables e.g. graphics files to your project folders or folder and add them to the project .
loads files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find details .
loads a panel tool@@ bar . these are kept in repository / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you as@@ sign them this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog box to add a new tool . actions you need to specify the name . actions must be saved using the tool@@ bar or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
thus , you can send their own tool bar to someone ( maybe at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download an &amp; D@@ TD ; you or any@@ body else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own quality format .
download / ref@@ resh the du@@ sts from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense when the En@@ ti@@ ties from &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is to ren@@ ew , without ren@@ ew the entire &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this global and a write permission is not available in the global K@@ DE folder , sli@@ pping the loading .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded product range . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is a sub@@ menu standard which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent add means &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool bar , if this day does not contra@@ dict the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above menu points . click on a enabled plug @-@ ins de@@ activ@@ ates .
select the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes is dependent on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
choose the type of line @-@ identification . very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of Ti@@ dy &apos;s external application .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch may require time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the default card mode , which also complies with the default mode , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selection of an application the appropriate window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the window of the window .
the changes in this dialog can be used every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
jud@@ ging the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears , where you can delete records from tool@@ bars or modify or modify the sequences .
that should create a help according to the mouse wheel , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but like at any open source project , developers can always support help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ expl@@ aining and should be completed at the top of the project , as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project characteristics can be set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
let this field be empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for various projects should be used instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for various projects should be used instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great , if you want to download and modify the static web content ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to do differently .
stim@@ ul@@ ing , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be mounted . if a project of reason is started , non @-@ aken .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good di@@ lution .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select files by h@@ anger or , through removing heads , out @-@ out of the project .
the last screen of the new project Assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu folder in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ shift ; F@@ 7 change .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) to re@@ read in project @-@ related operations like this file folder will be igno@@ red .
additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
thus the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be set using the Options button . in addition , troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the bottom @-@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building site for every profile , po@@ inting out a own building site for every profile .
in the sub @-@ windows team configuration , project members can be edited , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ windows event configuration you can switch off and delete these actions , alter or delete these actions , if a previously defined event occurs , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see the details .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior is not currently being applied .
to open a different project , select Open Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the repository will automatically be saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes prior to loading when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Modi@@ fied files will be done . the same happens if you want a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
folder also be@@ have , however , the entries must be opened and opened with ... using the right mouse button in the context menu :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded file .
enables removing the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will end to prevent removing .
the password will be kept at the core memory and forget the program . this possibility is useful when frequent upload files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the plate save -@@ option not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion from up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high@@ ways profiles can be created and therefore can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or create a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server which should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and now@@ here .
the port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . you can &apos;t use it after your discretion . it cannot be read on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read easily in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple de@@ cent of view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar .
views can be saved in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to make your own operation .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best possible via the tool@@ bar menu . use and adding . the addition of tool@@ bar is treated below in the section Hin@@ ds of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be configured either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be set up with New Action , a new tool bar , tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar , or tool@@ bars can be set to be displayed in the dialog where actions may be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will be removed and displayed action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up the menu with at@@ titudes of tool@@ bars ... and setting the settings ..
templates are in essential document code , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing in the Vor@@ one@@ tree link . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you prefer for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions displayed on the beginning of each template .
Bin@@ är is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries are inserted in documents using global templates . further information on the template tree is available in .
documents may be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents may be created . normally , a simple rum@@ ors can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples may be found in the previous tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area must always be inserted into the documents . you can find all examples of a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . see here for more information on templates .
as the name suggests , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
create a document structure according to your desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template as local template ....
once this happened , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project location ) the template is not visible in the tree @-@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As template . select your selection as local / project location . alternatively , select the selection simply by drag and drop to the building site templates .
the compilation of binary templates is simple : the file is only able to copy into a pre @-@ deposit folder . you can use all file management functions such as drag and drop or insert on the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder to click on the template and secure a name for template and secure . by default , it is saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very effective pre @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files , add or with them . additionally , you can keep some things while using templates in projects very pro@@ found in the eye .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as above .
to determine the behavior of a folder with right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features , the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ orted , once @-@ ter@@ most attributes is suspended .
this has been activated by default , but if a master folder would be adjusted in principle . if a regular folder would be set so otherwise it would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you can probably find in a family folder .
allows a leading or illustrated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a full presentation using the appropriate head@@ line / foot@@ lines .
in addition , we have a context menu ( showing right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; and source text editor that are accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it doesn &apos;t load a document like normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and select the source code editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to modify this code editor . it &apos;s no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously running the changes in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; editor are activated and the C@@ urs@@ or is active in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; this mode is already active that the keyboard pressure is maintained from a window to the others , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchronization between V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings qu@@ ant@@ um .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small gap for fast computers and a large range for slow .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , this is the editing of invisible tags when working with V@@ PL ; editor is also possible , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this will be the following :
met@@ a tags make the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or remot@@ ely . a click into the list allows the change of contents , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key word key .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS @-@ styl@@ istic template by pressing the button button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sors is like in a text processing , possible due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is beh@@ aved as usual . lyrics can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and using button or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way above the tool bar , as described in the source text editor , i.e. an anchor @-@ tag , i.e. an anchor @-@ day , sur@@ round with text , must be removed every other ambient air day .
some tool bar such as the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool to study breast@@ feeding . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding is possible , the search for certain elements can be pursued and execution of the breast@@ feeding system can be tra@@ cked .
to convert &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compiled , except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , i@@ bex@@ change and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available with a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ames without a file name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most super@@ charged file names to work file con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is loaded , for example , a breast@@ feed file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ set named the QNAP or a specified Mod@@ us@@ name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches on each QNAP template which template the string template .
each name room in the specified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expanded according to the rules specified by the X@@ SL @-@ source file specified by the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 , and extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a des@@ irable feed point has to be dissolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be automatically re@@ checked for the loading of the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re@@ checked shortly after the start of each pass .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly , why I have written .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had to change many changes and at the same time , another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly could be changed within these lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps the inser@@ tion of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any number of additional useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it into one of the comparative window .
a function which made a lot of work , was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ known file browser .
also 3 @-@ way assembly is fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently in one piece of code and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps dis@@ solve the correct result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; helps you also complete the complete folder and execute the complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; when mer@@ ging the folder :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ d@@ ges the possibilities of today colour monitors . if you often have to check any code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible visible . if rows are only visible in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the left on the left side . ( no anger , if none changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicate that the file is different . red color means that both files distinguish .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , the Ti@@ pp@@ le allows you to complete the file name of the first file completely . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder
the opening dialog allows manual entry of file names , the selection via the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last open file again . open dialog , you need to specify a third file ; if you don &apos;t have to leave the file for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , you will select a folder , for B and C a folder , then uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when inter@@ s@@ ing is checked , the input field is active and can be adjusted , however , it is not necessary to determine instantly a output file . you can also finish this step by saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . you can define options before starting with the same / merge operation .
sometimes one would not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialog , you can &apos;t need to connect the dialog with the break button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag an file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a reference window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar to these functions , it would only be able to upload them to &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy the relevant sections , then add and then compare these relevant sections .
note : you can not extract anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the text of text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag and dis@@ assem@@ bling text into another program as pr@@ un@@ ing and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such cases , your original data could perish .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , then enter the mouse over the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu ) .
if a difference is detected , the default color is different . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , only the relevant modifications are displayed only in character strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summar@@ izing column from the text , is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line will be shown on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison chart ) also has an Info @-@ line with the inscription &#91; changes &#93; if you have worked the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts are dissolved , saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use buttons J@@ ump to next sol@@ uble / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be manually replaced .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . ( this will also be seen in the beginning of the group . ) This group will be emphasi@@ zed out with the color background color for current range and on the left there will be a black bar .
sometimes , through the automatic assem@@ bling or by manual editing , no further line left in the list ; it &apos;s only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps another source . this text is neither released in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you might copy and paste it differently .
text &amp; lt ; inser@@ ting accounts ; however , in the clip@@ board , appear in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go c@@ auti@@ ously with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources list , Ig@@ nor@@ dic C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters .
navigate mainly to the keyboard and mouse , but you can use the keyboard . if you are using the keyboard , you can use the arrow keys to the right , right , end , Ctrl @-@ beginning and Ctrl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . this can also be used by clicking on the keyboard .
in the window window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inser@@ tion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section summar@@ izing and the edit window will be explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Ctrl @-@ down / Ctrl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ picture upward / Ctrl @-@ picture Ab@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all un@@ sol@@ uble conflicts can still be regarded as conflict . therefore , between sol@@ ving and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is checked , it will always be copied to the clip@@ board and manually copy it . be careful if you accid@@ entally checked the content of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a row @-@ slide @-@ in characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the s@@ wap file of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically when moving and re @-@ made during the next start . ( menu entry &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a lettering with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog covers a variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in short letters are displayed . if the selected writing does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be locked . to these systems , the button settings automatically displays an un@@ locked color .
if this option is activated , when pressing the Tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you enter or press Return , the entering line will automatically be used for the next row .
if this option is enabled , you will automatically copy any selection into the clip@@ board . manually copy into the clip@@ board .
you can choose which type @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when using files &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines can be igno@@ red . only during this first step , white signs can not be igno@@ red . in this step , white signs will not be igno@@ red . however , white signs will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car drop @-@ back &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , other in turn left and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car rear signs will be visible , but they could be de@@ activated , however , like a white character , however , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option must be de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red , however , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is de@@ activated by default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic further ski@@ p mode , this setting is how long the result will be displayed before going on the next un@@ resolved conflict .
dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters . if this is necessary as a source , it is useful if white characters are needed in many files , then take advantage of the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scan of folders and through a merge operation . check the details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version , the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without any further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . it does not affect the currently running program . you need to qu@@ it &amp; diff@@ 3 ; end and rest@@ art the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; it is not available globally via the control centre there . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is checked , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the encoding areas for encoding is a short notice that the local encoding is not changed . ( this can not be changed here and for you purely inform@@ al character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted by coding for each file , can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding for saving should be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may work 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) By this option , one can define the encoding of the output processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . depending on the selection from A &amp; B ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second @-@ secure column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply click the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
indicate the comparison window by side or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . if you are using only two files , this function starts when using only two files . ( if this function is used to execute the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be displayed first to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that precisely your needs . you can use this function for example to cut dist@@ ressing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when using the command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds precisely your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility during setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program needs to program , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that most of the cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . * \ \ &apos; in the string string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ amm@@ ing . the \ \ U converts the found text in capital letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you may start to understand , and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs , which support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command of the line &#91; &apos; &#93; / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign of &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a showing , and every one is replaced by nothing , thus quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes , you may be able to perform several stories at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the creation of each other . example :
instead SE@@ D you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos; s / switch &apos; allerg@@ y are required at per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for displaying and to merge . further operations change only the data , which sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a regular pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ t pre@@ processor uses the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with every function that changes or differences is hidden , you accid@@ entally either notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and assem@@ ble complete folders with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... making a proposal to assem@@ ble an object ; you can adjust the proposal from the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes without it really to accomplish ,
... runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compare and merge individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or the file .
when three folders are merged , folder is used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not the merge . to select the merge input , you must press the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow )
while reading the folder , you will inform you a small message window over the current progress . when you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning the folder is completed , displays &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder was found during the scan , click here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or click the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two features all sub@@ directories and check all sub@@ directories with which you can check or check all folder .
when you double click a file , the file will start and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the chosen object . in such a case , the c@@ ud@@ dle action can &apos;t be automatically chosen . if the association is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
however , with identical entries , the colour is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when all of its entire contents are identical . then folders are the same color . in folders , the age is un@@ considerably for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow is then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )

... a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types exist . as long as such f@@ law@@ less objects may exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types exist . as long as such f@@ law@@ less objects may exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder , and if the option will synchronize directories . then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , thus both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : assem@@ bling and result in both folders . ( the user can see the visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after assem@@ bling &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the option new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then the error message will be different , but the same date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge can not be started .
while mer@@ ging a file is executed according to the other . it &apos;s status column indicates when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other noti@@ fications , if something unexpected is completed , you should see a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if the setup dialog is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the right entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all entries ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ file mer@@ ging mode C , B will be used as target and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through the specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to comp@@ ress all entries : select directory merge / continue to merge in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key substitute ) : select the promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist invalid , there will be a message which indicates the incorrec@@ t element . you can then select a valid promotion for them .
if you perform all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , em@@ ulating and disman@@ t@@ ling .
select Sim@@ ulate When you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then guides certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is required ( execute a single file ) , then opens a merge window ( note the image screenshot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select another directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved it , a corresponding dialogue appears . then leads &amp; diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the conclusion of the list you will notice some error messages which may help you to select the cause of problem . so you have the option to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before running with the merge .
if some entries were gathered together , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not follow it again . even if the interaction must not be saved or not saved . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
set the Settings menu from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . are several patterns be entered . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . file must not correspond to that pattern .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ res files that are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files will be igno@@ red by CV@@ S . ( check under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some file systems , files have a hi@@ de@@ compression attribute . in other file systems you will select a leading point . this option can choose whether these files are enabled in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
for links to files : if the option is switched , symbolic links are compared , if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
for links to Fol@@ der : if the option is switched on , the symbolic links are checked and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that &amp; diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records ) , the link will be linked to a check @-@ loop . ( note : ) This option is dis@@ connected to a check @-@ loop and cr@@ ushing . ) This option is dis@@ connected in the default .
does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when they are applied to files which does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a slow network , it may be faster , only change the change date and the file size . this speed advantage does not cost you . please use caution with caution . this option is dis@@ connected with caution .
similar to the ch@@ anges@@ et date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical when copying the modification date . please use caution with caution . this option is dis@@ connected with caution .
activ@@ ating the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions are selected as follows , also the results from the merge files are saved in both folders . this option is un@@ locked in the default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered un@@ sure that the other file could not be changed too . ) This option is dis@@ connected in each case . ) This option is dis@@ connected .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ original if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original file , this will not only be installed without further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting .
normally , the folders merge @-@ view is visible to the merge operation ; you can switch the window divider over the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch between the two views via the directory and text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu , you can merge a single file directly . if you want to merge the folder , the status will not be done again if you want to merge the folder .
this status is however lost if you want to re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new entry
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive containing a local folder .
one URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things you should consider :
a path can be relatively , or .. .. it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then there is always a file adopted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change date . hence the per@@ missions or change of change from the original ( please note that option is possible only with local files ) .
the main purpose purpose is currently available as the differences consideration in K@@ Dev@@ elop . K@@ Dev@@ elop first starts the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences consideration and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally it requires &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , the input file contains a patch file in unified format . then switch &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or click here you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; when Part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in the device mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ avier it is available ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already provided that it may be combined like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use the GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned much in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers who go this way or go it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE may not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if this is not identical , this line will be treated as not identical . if this is not identical , this line will write this way to each other , this includes O@@ FT@@ EN the case .
the editor noted for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is needed , however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
the effort involved has been too big . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to increase large amounts of text , an other editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly done ; no src left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; already use many colors for creating differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for it .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
you can find information on how to use K@@ NO@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please refer to the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the query package .
to comp@@ ile and install diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; please use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are un@@ safe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should have problems with comp@@ iling . should difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out the clip@@ board ( Ctrl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
only differences are listed : files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder structure , and therefore not in destination folder .
( in the current program version , you have to upgrade the folder to the folder with the Update function . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder will not be copied to the target folder , if the destination folder will not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( behavior is probably dis@@ connected during a later program version . ) This option is un@@ locked .
note the buttons to choose from the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if there are not already exist ) . if the lines are already available , they will click on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ shoot in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to change their size to change their size or move it . this works both within a working area as well as several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual areas of work as well as the applications that can be moved and even on the desktop and to others .
with the central mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; moving within a working area as well as on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends , where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it is cli@@ cked , the context menu and the name of the application and the entries are minim@@ ized , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and don@@ ating . commands the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this box is selected , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , the name of virtual working areas are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
cross this field rot@@ ates the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of virtual working areas . it is fitted together with name , will be fitted together with name , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also available as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is crossed , the ongoing programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work space will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , how made from p@@ ager @-@ applications in some other window managers , horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical series , which is very well suited for displaying on the desktop on your desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can display in size and sliding windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs out outside the control bar .
Click the right button of the mouse within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting switching switches ... can be set up the dialog settings .
currently this hasn &apos;t changed the dialog for Settings - but you can manually do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you have no write permission for the file , you have to register as a user root or refer to your system administrator . in this file , you need to as@@ sign the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and as@@ sign a value .
since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base is , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE @-@ Grund@@ pak@@ ete .

if you have &amp; k@@ like ; starting a window as shown above . the main window appears from &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of screen . in the following window is shown as the magni@@ fying window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window is shown in the following as a selection window .
in the default settings &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter is like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can provide a selected set area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse wheel at the screen edge ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse indicator in enlarged window , select the click of mouse po@@ inting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse wheel . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse indicator .
in the drop mode you can customize the selection window to your needs . you can change it with arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse po@@ inting window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move it into the arrow keys .
if you want to push the &amp; Shift ; press the &amp; M@@ MB button , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window can be fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse po@@ inting a while on the same place . it is thought to help people suffering from the RS@@ I Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and for which every mouse click pain@@ s pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse po@@ inting a while . it is intended to help people who use pain within the Rep@@ eti@@ tive strain ( RS@@ I ) . Moreover , it can em@@ ulate pain with your mouse . however , it does not require a little exercise .
&amp; m@@ ous@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can handle the pain , which is created when clicking the mouse , helping people to use pain without pain . unfortunately , suffer from the blo@@ ws of your computer . unfortunately , you should consult a physician , if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool can avoid pain , which arise when clicking on the mouse , it is us@@ eless against pain that is caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic assistance , the result can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click if you break the movement shortly .
if the smart shi@@ ver activ@@ ates , makes &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , a break after pressing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling when pressing the mouse button . the smart shift requires a little exercise but you &apos;re thinking about it quickly .
this time , after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , has to hide a mouse click .
is Intelligent Vari@@ ables enabled , the fil@@ let shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is set . here the time is set to let the mouse button wait , before it opens the mouse button when it is not possible because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . this function is activated , followed by a break , a click with right mouse button . this movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can sl@@ ay &amp; k@@ de ; to do so , see Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a Sli@@ der Sound @-@ buffer , which you can reduce to a lower value in order to reduce your response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other windows environments , please click here to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the user after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should first be switched off . if you then click the automatic mouse click here , you can later alter the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should consci@@ ously make a mouse click without effect , clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or on the browser window that doesn &apos;t want link to un@@ wanted reactions . you can park your mouse on such places until you would like to use it again .
if your mouse is stack@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty easy . the tri@@ ck is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse balls , but also the rolls that come with the mouse button in contact .
first , you must take out the mouse balls . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the tri@@ ck and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when it &apos;s just a shift process . if you &apos;re using the intelligent shift , this means that &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should not be able to finish the operation by the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is in fact that you can perform a mouse click here . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . you can use the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop if you want to create a keyboard @-@ click here ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars are enc@@ ased ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title line of windows .
I tried to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can move . it &apos;s very probably possible to move it into the clip@@ board or to insert any other action , where you will probably get problems with pressed mouse button . here are some advice about it :
do not use the smart shift , if you just start to use &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select the text instead of the text area , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text , and hold the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click here if &amp; cr@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; m@@ ous@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension has to be installed and should be installed on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a speakers and these properly furnished .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , provided the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inting short . this program was designed for people who suffer at RS@@ I Syndrome and to whom the suffer@@ ers of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be configured that a certain time is waiting to let a pulling process begins before rele@@ asing the mouse button . in this way , the drag @-@ up process can also be done .

&amp; mouth ; is a program , with the silent users can talk its computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; allows users to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the inter@@ section propositions which should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left image screenshot ) enter the command that is used later for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you can select the standard text password . from the text @-@ pass@@ ers you can choose often used text @-@ passages without having to type them . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( righ@@ t@@ mf@@ oto ) you define the dictionary for the language course . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can adjust the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary that can only be recorded properly .
the main window from &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the scanning rate of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the propositions which you want to listen to the input field you want to hear . each spoken phr@@ ase will be attached to the run memory . you can choose from this sentences which should be spoken again .
set the Settings menu Setting k@@ mouth ; Setting up the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page dec@@ ou@@ pling and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the Language Edition , enter the command to call the language code . in the selection field under the input field you put the character encoding using the text on the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text remains unchanged as default on the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to write speech from your language generator . these commands can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are available in App@@ endix .
when trying to use kt@@ ops as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . when this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the option of this option is useful , and the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , you can determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text box book or in the vest for text fitting boards .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the disk space . with the selection from In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box , you can set the editing window for text pass@@ age@@ able , whether the text box book when closing the editing window will be saved automatically .
with the selection of text password books , the book will be saved . if you select any changes , the text box book will not be saved . select Before saving , then &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text box book will be saved .

probably you have not entered the command for the language output right or not completely entered . open the Settings icon ; please open the page general settings and specify the command of the language output . ( see Settings dialog for Voice to Further details . )
Festival is a speech @-@ edition system of Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch supported . the license allows you to use and dissemin@@ ate the festival without restrictions .
to demonstrate an example of the command line for setting the language output , is assumed that Festival / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to speech is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS to use and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ iter . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application ) .
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ y file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assem@@ ble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA using the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to have the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / dec@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option will be switched on to default .

filter for string labels provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ops ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which includes the scope of delivery &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . they removed tags b@@ r and b from the messages that can be sent via mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as required .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before it is sent to the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation , to select incorrec@@ tly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to deal with certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; different types of texts .
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and does not keep these orders . if the output of the screen Reader is read , the obtained orders will be back again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to get hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and plain text . these contracts will continue after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message is breaking normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that uses news . during you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a web page , you can enter into space . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . every order which you used by card ticket orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text entries . text entries are thought for the output longer texts that have no particular g@@ ing@@ ness .
all four orders are processed in qu@@ eu@@ e , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . when applying the output of a Screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a pre @-@ read , will hold this issue and finished .
first you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text orders and on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters edit the text and put it on the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
strings replacing parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions , which allow creation of chat emotional sens@@ ations like : - ) by text or for the formatt@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language , Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with intercom sel@@ ections , you can depend on the content of the text or depend on the program , which sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ news about it . read more about the text .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which it is defined for voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter does not apply , does not affect the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; alert on &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent them through all activated filters , which have been set up at the bottom in the list below .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter does not pass through , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be removed from the series up to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below for the following setup dial@@ ogs .
for setting up string filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison . these samples are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the appropriate replacement .
enter a name for your filters . you can choose your name any number , it needs to distinguish itself only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter res@@ embles the text with the strings in the column and replace it with the string from column . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the latest list or delete a list from the file to the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is used for text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; Ctrl ; button .
if a value is registered , the filter is only applied when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separated by Com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run @-@ out programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
the string filters will then be applied to the text when all conditions associated with an entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the strings filter is regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must be limited to both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be installed on a well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached .
with the optional speaker selection , you can send text to a specific spokes@@ man , which is set on the box map speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can specify that texts by k@@ mail from one female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text on the filter is looking for a nar@@ ration for the text . the speaker is selected using the nar@@ ration properties , which provides the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the characteristics of the user card speakers selected , you can over@@ write the selected nar@@ ration .
if the text is registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ arding the button you can call this one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of your desired guide . if the text meets the above @-@ indicated filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . Click on the button to indicate the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your intercom settings or er@@ ase all settings .
the speaker selection filters will then apply only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ esen filter . you must enter at least a constra@@ int .
the voice @-@ edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers to provide their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . full documentation for both AP@@ Is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications are calling for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the object K@@ Speech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , you enter
open two &amp; console ; window . start a window in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language synchron@@ ized my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so if you do not want to use S@@ able to read this voice , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or points of points seem to cause errors when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so whole sentences over@@ jumps or only Cau@@ cas@@ ks are issued . what can I do against it ?
initially , make sure that the option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , it may be solved by a string section filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language synchron@@ ized , which can be launched on the command line in one &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , refer to the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module architecture for voice synthesis . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the Developer &apos;s team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the package k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and the development files for the program &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source lyrics of &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source context for k@@ de@@ pp or have downloaded the program currently being installed , you install and install the program with the following commands :
before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if using speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the shell script file @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; that is how the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is used so that the setup of multi @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual propositions . the user may return , or ab@@ rupt change , repeat the output or break off .
if an application contains text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , you can request a female english speaker . if you have selected a speaker , this is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is selected , otherwise , if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker is selected , see you in .
if you click on the map tab , click on the list , and thus click on Edit menu button , the box map speaker will be shown . as an example , you will find the module setup for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
select the string code for text , which will be passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; these settings will be performed automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and do not display this grey , the chosen voice can &apos;t be displayed .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices require several seconds to be loaded . if you are loaded with this check box , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( for larger storage consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forgot to click on users ) .
if this box is selected , the program window is displayed on t@@ kt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after launching , the symbol t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr running , it doesn &apos;t appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD . thus , you have the possibility to keep right or otherwise .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eu@@ e , together with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map tab .
with buttons in this series you can select a path in the order which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . Click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts are not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
only text jobs are listed and administered . issues of Screen re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and news are not displayed . further information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
choose the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul compiled or kt@@ ops ; may not load the necessary libraries .
when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . do you have AL@@ SA to select the PCM device .
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal intercom speed . to allow these settings , the SO@@ x program must be installed .
Click on the user to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of the AL@@ SA device includes all PCM equipment and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this box map you can set particular actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processed four types of language orders :
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and returns these orders . after the issu@@ ing of the screen Reader was specified , the obtained orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to get hot . a warning keeps the issue of news and plain text . these contracts will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg , you can read a long text on a web page , you can welcome you just entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output in the qu@@ eu@@ e takes place .
this audio file is always played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both sem@@ iconductor sounds are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this box map are only valid for normal text jobs . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen re@@ a@@ ars there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts .
mark this check box to disable the preview of &amp; k@@ de ; do not disable this setting , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ops ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add the events to the list or delete it . if you click the button , a dialog appears that you want to add the application and the event you want to list .
this event reads the message , sending &amp; conversation ; sent when somebody mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , unless otherwise specified in the list , are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ops .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do you have the following selection options :
if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can set the characteristics of the desired phone call . standard sel@@ ects the speaker from which is displayed in the list on the map tab on the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . for a certain event , there will be a promotion that is executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . as the last possibility , the action will take place among standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) :
use the button Save to store the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . if you want to load the settings from a file , click del@@ eting . if you want to start with an empty list , click del@@ eting . all entries are deleted except all directions will be deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a language output . this standard contains marks for controlling the voice of voices , volume control , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually found very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear &apos;s son . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filter and set bound@@ less filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start text in single sets , as only the first sentence must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you may not jump , or cancel or cancel my text , even if the voice synthesis are not directly supported .
here you see the bound@@ less detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can change its settings or add other proposition character filters , but beginners will not be used .
at the easi@@ est way , you will learn how to check the intercom selection . switch on the map selection , select a few features and check back how the selection of the microphone has changed . to this , you will have to have set more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then qu@@ icker by reading , as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you are then able to stop or cancel text orders , even if the language synchron@@ ized this function is not supported .
for these reasons the normal movement lim@@ iting filter is automatically set when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr into the first time . it cannot be removed , unless you know what you do .
Satan recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ posi@@ tional and paste a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits automatically from the lyrics . note that the standard movement lim@@ it@@ ates the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ gs ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have seen the normal movement limit filter , you can insert this again by loading the file _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
the card selection menu allows you to over@@ write intercom settings for application . the card box will be shown if
using the standard speaker ( the top on the box map speaker ) . in other words , no speakers are specified .
use the most appropriate microphone , which indicates all properties of a furnished microphone , select &amp; kt@@ ops , sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ops ; this nar@@ ration is made ; otherwise it sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker from which the main characteristics was originally introduced .
select the method for entering the desired intercom function by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired microphone . if this feature doesn &apos;t play any role , don &apos;t give anything .
mark this check box when the property has priority to other features . you can also reset several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding , this feature is always treated as a priority rating . you may use this feature rarely , if you probably want to specify the attribute language , if you may know that a certain application contains text in any other language than the environment specified in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area of spokes@@ man , use the following commands , click on the select button , and then apply to speaker , which complies with the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ e@@ ability .
track record is crashed , and &amp; kt@@ ops . if the problem is not solved . if the problem is not solved . if the problem is not solved , possibly a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install g@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I start playing music with another application . if I get a text order , fri@@ gh@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message it says : &quot; to open PCM .
on your system , the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA will occur , which enables simultaneously connecting multiple PCM devices . hin@@ ts for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows that voice doesn &apos;t .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices added the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the box map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ x installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers module such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are igno@@ red if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML . ( that &apos;s ) that the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t believe that websites with one female voice can be read . I have set a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work . for the festival does not work any errors , the X@@ SL file again casts the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string filters and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ops ; not more pro@@ s or return . on the box @-@ box orders , the order is displayed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
points ( point , question mark , exc@@ lamation marks , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use a filter for a bound@@ less detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected ect@@ .org )
be@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered , by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not play music and start a text when you get a text order and then take another start . possible solutions for this problem you will find on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with Stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de hasn &apos;t support real p@@ auses . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will still be read yet .
the SO@@ x audio program is used for general adjustment of speaking speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a Tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ et archive ) , you register as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball in a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably only removed or at least on request .
the following modules for voice synthesis are created by default . some of them have a running time @-@ free movement of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free after de@@ activate the de@@ cent distribution ) , the configure option shows the configure parameter , which causes the transfer of the creation .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 , this folder will not be listed in the surrounding variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example
on Deb@@ ian @-@ Systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ file echo @-@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ e@@ fil@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make install install
before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your language synchron@@ ized properly works . follow the instructions you &apos;ve got with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is generally good , and it supports multiple voices and languages . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . you will find instructions in the instructions that can be supplied with the festival . would you like to install websites you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations .
this voice puts a festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to set a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian , or Czech language , the encoding line must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Kyr@@ gy@@ ms as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then the festival takes over the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language output system . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; necessary di@@ phon@@ em@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce also from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found below .
for this procedure , additional wrap code to the festival will be added to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; files are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; files are installed , but in the / lib / . instructions below
IMS German festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then invite you to MS German festival of

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; any language synchron@@ ized , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line can be controlled .
best use a command that writes the language output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called through the selection of K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( kn@@ u@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; cr@@ on@@ work@@ conf can &apos;t install any device hardware . physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured , thus &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all and enables the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed network devices later , the drivers must be loaded according to the kernel version , according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is automatically loaded if the network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this is automatically recognis@@ able to detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the suspended selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the Distribution and Rel@@ eas@@ ement . by selecting the setting non @-@ once @-@ requests , the setting of the network settings will then be set to be set automatically .
modi@@ fying the network setting is possible only in system management mode . before , all the options are gray , meaning , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can only be viewed by clicking the button management mode at the lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the installed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog device can be arranged .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection , the TCP / IP settings will be collected from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information will be provided with any system start@@ up , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be provided . in the input field , the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field .
this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values set in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the tool box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the address is already used . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch on one switched network device via selection from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch off an activated network device through selection from the list and click interface ....
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default in TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if computers may only use IP addresses , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calculator for the name resolution part of the horse name resolution allows simple management of this list . entries can be added , removes or modified . DNS entries can be made up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons or down@@ gra@@ ding in the priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calculator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . the new name will be added by the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add the button .
from the group calculator to choose the name resolution you select one entry and then click on button edit .... It will display the edit dialog .
the list of @-@ known calculator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address instructions for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting when does not replace DNS server . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS Server .
normally , the list of @-@ known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support this still in the test @-@ found version of IP should replace 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The Dialogue New alias will be added .
enter the name of the familiar computer and enter the button . if the known calculator has several alias names , add button Add several times and enter the additional alias name .
choose an entry of a well @-@ known computer from list and select Edit .... The dialog of acquain@@ t@@ ance will be displayed .
it can be carried out one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK the list of the static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf is htt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . just download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; kn@@ it work@@ conf ; the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC is provided in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 never has large distribution . IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator the response station , which can be used by a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can &apos;t be selected as desired !
when placing a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore their any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses can be used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are located in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP transmission .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as an enclosed circle .
in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as defined there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ kos@@ config . another stand is expected to occur as expected .

&amp; dat ; is a sigh@@ ting program for tape drives based on tar . the development of &amp; soldier , with two objectives . the second goal was to create a surface for tar , which introduced my wife : how much longer will it take if you sec@@ ures it ?
before a band can be used , it has to be supported by &amp; dat ; this can occur in three ways :
&amp; dat ; trains the band and reads the st@@ ressing information of the tape . reco@@ gn@@ ise &amp; dat ; the band doesn &apos;t ask , you &apos;ll be asked if the band will be formatt@@ ed .
detects &amp; dat ; the pre@@ h@@ unter , search for the appropriate index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is newly created .
everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar it can be searched for the band by pressing the entry for the band .
before exp@@ iry of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to evaluate this :
&amp; dat ; gives an amendment to the band for the band that integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without any danger .
before being used by a band of &amp; dat , it must be formatt@@ ed by &amp; dat ; formatt@@ ed .
a belt types must be formatt@@ ed before you have to use the formatt@@ ing at &amp; dat ; this procedure does not comply with formatt@@ ing at &amp; dat ; it does not affect formatt@@ ing the tape before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives are typically required to formatt@@ ing the tape before using DA@@ T drives .
after entering the band name and the capacity is driving &amp; dat ; with the formatt@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape is lost automatically ! after completing the formatt@@ ing process , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the insured files . that can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
mark a secure profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the so @-@ marked files and / or folder are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu
once the backup was introduced , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of backup process , including data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archives created for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the marked files and / or folder are checked .
with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the test procedure has started , the dialog for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and data throughput and the remaining time .
before installing the recovery , the files that should be restored , can be selected , can be selected in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . only the selected file or folder will be restored .
select the files from one of the archives created with a bun@@ ch . only the so @-@ marked files and / or folder are recovered .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu to restore ...
once the recovery process has started , the dialog for Recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the job folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog appears to restore the progress of recovery and data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the tape @-@ inde@@ x@@ able using the Band@@ in@@ hal@@ tes . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index over two kinds of tape :
this is a secure profile with the straight selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be made . the list of the insured files will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that can only be saved on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folders . file that can be stored on other file systems , can be saved separately under backup files . each entry is considered independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been used since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will only be secured that have changed since then .
the file name , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
tar s@@ ails the snap@@ shot file before calling tar which all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file is used for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of preparation of this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... In the Settings menu , you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path doesn &apos;t have to point to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , it is necessary to load before reading or write operations .
this option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; the discharge of tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when the integration of &amp; dat , the tape is switched on . use this option not on Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat ; the hard@@ copy block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; dat ; in any case the block@@ size for your tape drive .
when &amp; dat ; a band formatt@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is your name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is formatt@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds , which have passed since the ep@@ och , where the band has been formatt@@ ed .
the Band @-@ ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are non @-@ incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer can not know where you can get information about your system or where you can obtain information about your system or where the system enables you to access the various protocol files ; experienced users the quick access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of protocol files of the own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can not know where you depos@@ ited information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows for quick access to information on problems related to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended functions , using the protocol @-@ files of certain programs and can be evaluated .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a range of useful functions . among other things , include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Samba
many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following displays , &amp; k@@ system@@ log files ; functions are available , with their help you can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . if you don &apos;t appear , and it opens up to a small message window . the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the / var / log file for the normal user or do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter on a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to set string . in default , select a protocol line next to the selected filter . then , a protocol line will be displayed next to the selected filter . then , a protocol line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns contain the string search string .
you can also select another entry at this point of course . select the column process that is displayed in the protocol file system log into the column process , and then apply it into the filter strip on the name of a process , thus shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol @-@ rows sent and compiled by this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a clear color as protocol @-@ lines of step note . setup dialog can be disabled .
if you would like to show a certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or on cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can find the process identification ( PID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific instruction as for example to start the Samba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can navigate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol from the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you find further information on the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard control system when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible is the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I won &apos;t continue to go on historical aspects ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know anything about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to change a machine on System V in@@ it , without having a new installation and new formatt@@ ing . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains all full scripts . basically you need a script for any system service which you want to start at the start of the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; System services include not such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not have this file , even if it is actually not much use it . you can also wish to execute a r@@ c.@@ serial n / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first which he finds .
the default run@@ level is written in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably will notice that the pre @-@ established run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair something , then proceed to the system by rest@@ oring the system and execute the following :
but how to start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no right files are located . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that it accepts a argument as start@@ up and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it &apos;s a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people wish to establish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user @-@ run level , &amp; quot ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry in the section of Available System Services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop too ) .
you can change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . this is not only done when they draw an entry in the area of Available System Services .
note : entries will be moved , if you choose to select this into a new run@@ level , you have explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu and add them to the target range - even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries which have been cast into the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the various working ranges ( Available System Services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous step .
to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctrl ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with Ctrl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the names of a single entry , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog button to accept the changes or press Es@@ c to disc@@ lose the changes .
because of loss of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ) . otherwise , they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be normally in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for proprietary entry programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also if they are stored in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without message if its configuration files are not available or incorrec@@ tly arranged .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run @-@ level varies from distribution to distribution , even if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; users ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; user ; reading .
after you have made changes , you have to save it . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or entry Save in the file .
&amp; user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user groups . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics .
some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings , you can create customized settings , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed in BSD .
the password password is appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD -@@ Unix .
this card box appears only if for at least a registered file system space restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameter , whereby the limited number of information is available in KB :
