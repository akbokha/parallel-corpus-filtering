<seg id="14">The specificity of & fsview; consists of graphically-coloured folders with help of a-called Tree-map. each object is indicated by a rectangle that is proportional to its size. this size must have the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. consequently, large files, even if they can easily be detected, as a graphical and interactive Version of & UNIX; Command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap-Display a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the right-corner provides meaningful colour and labeling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view of colour mode, can display either depth for easy detection of the fusion depth or image of a different file system, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be determined with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for every feature, you can specify if enough space is available, or whether the area of sub-ordinates shall be used (whereby the accuracy is displayed by limitations in the Treemap). furthermore, you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the presentation algorithms for Treemaps, the area should always be observed, that the area is proportional to the size of the entry, and this setting is not always available. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As partitioning the area of a single entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is thus advantageous for the labelling and prevention of placements through frame always advantageous that rectangle are possible, the best possible methods are possible, columns, columns or recursive runner-up.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum mentioned area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a diamond pattern in the area of the ordered entry is drawn, in order to indicate that this area is actually indicated by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission of the computer. the camera will also be implemented as a USB mass memory device. the camera can also use over the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras are using the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital kameras. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large files and transfers across the serial port, this link is now obsolete. it supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support. the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camcorders. if the EXIF support is not used by some libgphoto2 images, you will possibly be able to see, or the generation could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, work processes, constant growth of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files facilitates backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are searching for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to save metadata in the creation page of metadata in & digitization. if you forget that EXIF and IPTC data can be saved in the file, then you can subsequently select the metadata from the database into the corresponding point.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what do you want to change; it's a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you can select all pictures, labels and evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures, which you need the same attribute and then place the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us continue using keyword, keywords, how you frequently use other programs frequently, or categories. every three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogized images from another source with embedded application, then add & digitization; automatically build the images to the right place. the modified keyword will be done by & digitites; updated and updates the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very coarse representation as every block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are characteristic of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to let anybody know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe to know how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer look at some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say that this is the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period of time you may even hear the silence. the label has completely changed your attention to this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider the title itself more important than the picture itself is more important than the picture itself. if you want to show a story. do you think it is the meaning to help Him to help him about the motive that you move, what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only has an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can export a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. if you would like to export your images into the label and / or the title of the Web Galeriesystems. you will need to tell you a second time for opening images.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet on GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation has already been with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalization are already countless. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your journeys with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with Copyright and describes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms shall also apply in all amended versions, i.e. even for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digiplug; as information you should be:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for actors and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to be the name of a company or organization, it should not be changed. this field does not support Commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples are the title of the photographer, free professional photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the author's field, this also has to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the image is a warehouse, then the group / agency will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although it does not provide protection against misuse. everybody knows this problem in the image of embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos only. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; in the near future, there will be such a module for pile processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record mistake, record failure, streamlining, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desperation, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that you can pass on traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest recovery firm, has some interesting statistics that has reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they need to be treated for more than a few years. of course, you can also find CDs and DVDs in archive quality who claim to be more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it lies in your discretion room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you can use good dispensing and good recording, but you are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it is about to choose the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you are just written. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the control environments. despite this massive protection it requires through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cost-effective program named IsoBuster will perform the apparently wonders among CDs and Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged disks of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB, and thus almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn the data back to a high-quality media in a non-quality media in a non-quality media. then you should read the media with a description, date & author characteristics and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy disks keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing must include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on error mechanisms of hard drives: disfault study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, if you are at the longest temperature range from 35 ° C up to 45 ° C, this error is the most common fault guard, SMART can't notice this error. some of the SMART fixed errors are obvious. this is particularly Lesefer and publishing counter. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files, but these losses usually leave again without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices can't matter many electrical devices, these can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause heavy damage, complete data loss, hardware loss, modified motherboards and other defects. therefore, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs energy heat and the rest is normally available. do not think any plug-in bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should consider the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects the protection against flashbacks, thereby protecting the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should also be connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connecting facilities for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable voltage protection. therefore a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection is used to protect your system before smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to loss of unwarranted data. it can therefore be useful in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically place battery energy when a power failure occurs. if you want to keep your data even further, you should be sure that it fulfils the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed, and compare its security in power problems with the costs to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & Euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think about it. at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a device under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular deal offering you any data stored on data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services which are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will get your pictures not available, in the event of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage. thus, they are scanning.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transmissions are due for transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs put at least the data integrarity between the operating system and the disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain uncomfortable until you have not discovered a photo until you have no protection for it. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data road than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses because they generate interferences inside the data streams. in normal file systems these faults remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates back to a lower level, and it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its bunker file system. it is still used in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% when notebooks is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of viruses. it is currently limited to a lower damage (e.g. theft or reinstallations); Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: incorrectly, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. this is a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrectly, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human mistakes are the main causes for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. meant that the technology continues to continue its progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already deteriorated for compact cameras and the end result. even DSLR cameras did your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will get you today for 100 & Euro; so you don't get anybody else for data loss. therefore, secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you can make this backup like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of records or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircrafts: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a no local storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup, it is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete securing: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete security and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files which have been changed since the last backup. generate several snapshots. this backup is made to one such backup at any time. this securing is made possible with the exception that it is only decreased and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that really changed. this happens, and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure your images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optically medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a momentum for each month. each additional dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file saved IPTC files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images can survive the next 40 years that is about the time span that you are really interested in you, because they remind you of your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable, everything must be said today. unfortunately, there is no other way to look back as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should have used yourself as the current system backwards. depending on the number you have been used in the past, it is easier to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you are so an old system, it is important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other side the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the subject print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means actually always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go from that you have chosen the scalability with you and they want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record in MBI / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBB; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and travel FS / dev / sdc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if there is no software even if one day can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it's loss-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend Gamma- and Chromatist data for a better color assignment, but not as many as TIFF. this format we would like to store you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (deflate). a problem is however, that this format can be adjusted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a licensed and open mass image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the usage of metadata. it is already available on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. it is now available to use the Canon and Nikon DNG.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology has been introduced to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a file that allows users to convert your data into one file itself. file information are saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers do it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, which records metadata separately from the image file. however, it can be superior to link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider how to use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which support a wide range of application areas and business models. the activities of DCMI-communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the reader, or the scanner. for example, you can use the images on the cameramedium, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save those in your tube. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you want to add the pictures, then you should add the metadata to the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them in webgaleries, you can use in MPEG, please print in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; you can add a description that you can already add on your hard drive. the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera by & digiplug; connect this with the computer, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. for some cameras, the file names are displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol are displayed for each file, photos, films, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you can possibly require the camera information on each entry. with the lateral bars and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photo information that will be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that for some digital cameras don't have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata as EXIF, manufacturer's note, GPS etc. the picture is the same as with the metadata panel's main window, or image processing. please note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then add the photos from their camera to a single album. when downloading, the pictures are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option to download and then choose the photos. the button download is available as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. this pictures have not been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures are available with a star in preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons, you can download a dialog, with which you can select your destination album, sorted according to the list of existing albums, sorted in section My albums. then select the destination album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After completing the target album, press OK, and digiplug; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the requested photos, you can delete this from the camera by delete the button. if you just want to delete the button, you'll need to delete it first and delete out.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore photos which you have deleted from the camera. you should be sure to delete it out. if you want to delete it out of the camera. if you want to delete it out of the camera, you should make this much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually installed, if you have taken photos from different recording applications, if you have taken photos from different recording applications, this can be useful, the date and time to integrate the file into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirrors the image and date-based signatures. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission opens three further options, which will be conducted before the photos can be saved on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF data will be copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. do not switch the date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the command of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, den & digiplug; for a photo, is displayed below the name, the camera is stored in a preview that will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about orientation of the camera to the time point of recording. not all cameras provide this information. in the aspect bar Metadata you can find further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally enabled, and when your camera does not supply this information, & digiplug it; the photo in original orientation: if you want the automatic rotation, use the button narrowed and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera was made available, at which the photo was made available, you can use & digiplug; this undergo is based on the same subalbum. all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub-album. all the cameras are available in the same sub-album. not all the cameras available. in the section sidebar-data you can read what about your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, and digiplug it; the photos can switch directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you'll need to switch the button narrowed and select the disk-based bottom bracket at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button download. you can then select the file selection dialog & kde; it can also be uploaded to the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digial; you where the pictures are uploaded to the pictures. select the desired folder and press OK to launch the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common term in this document. this means that the data can be displayed in length and latitude. the determination of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses an airplane to send an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten your photo, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digiti.When you want to document the location of the photos, it is easy to document the position of photos from the photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has supported many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, on a processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last more than the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there is a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or through transmission of data with one cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of the GPS data from one device can be used with gpsman or gpsbur. however, these data must be saved in GPX format, as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlated data from the GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude or other data, you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the default coordinates to be created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com is showing no European street types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Update right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light output & digiplug; can be set on this page. if you are then enabled, these settings are switched on. if you have different sizes and synchronous mode, you should only use different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can get better overview results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch this here. you can use the tool bar when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are set here. in image processing, this insight can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compressing, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, as PNG needed a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thus means 1: a low and 9 compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can disable the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not affect the image quality, as the deflate algorithm uses lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you have written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size was better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not supported, metadata was still not supported but in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; image processing is only a photo stand for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default bandwidth is that all green pixels are identical to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd lines. if you use this option, this creates a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, white drops of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set off. standard is a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that the exposed photos can be found in four steps more details into the top-lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the Spitzbergen, i.e. the parts of your images are embedded in the settings of your camera. setting the setting colors, because it displays the more unusual results, as it displays the Spitzlichter in various roses. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible, since blue pixels is generally not as fast as fast as green and red. & dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red percentage of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminant to your taste. you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of & digiplug; -image processing. to keep the time for the demosawaiting small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaism algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data that have many cameras and provides a matrix-coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dome w offers three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, he produces color paintings on the edges. Bilinear is interesting, if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color rendering of your lentils, you can set the rotor and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color refusal correction, while it is performed during the feedbacks.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and provides instructions as this again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information how to translate color information from one colour space in the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if a picture in image processing is opened / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folders: set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / .color / ICC, where you all store your profiles. & digiplug; this folder will examine these folders during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles here are the ability & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures color is not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be created to the camera actor and model you are using. not all profiles are created on the same way. currently, dcraw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof-Profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can be used as your camera and a few colors therefore very saturated. this could be manually adjusted, rather than on the blind algorithm your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obviously which color profile is designed for them. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can recognize the style of the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plug-in interface. it is an interface designed by a series of & kde; image views and image processing; many modules support, which have been written to work together with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules installed, you can select a list of available modules, and they are then loaded by & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the Main window, and beyond that there are some also in the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; so you are not part of your distribution. more information about KIPI modules can be found in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and current picture size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no other features will change the original photo before you save file Save or button Save from the tool bar if you don't want to recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make sure a copy of your image before you modify it. you can save it with file Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Edit file again. you lose any change that you have done in the photo since last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of image processing can be restored or recovered. the last action can be retrieved, relocating editing or re-produced by selecting Edit menu from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this frequently use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB, the toolbar, or restoring button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions you will be made between, too, and recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the menu file, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in the photo and zoom out in it Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or select the entries in the setup menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Image Mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the Esc key. if you do not want to change this, you can change this from & digiplug; main window will be calling; see the section to set up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print in the file format and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can download the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole movements. all picture preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods. when you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice only.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which makes important information and actions available for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available, even in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiples click on the same rider lets the sidebar will appear and disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label, you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert. note that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF and IPTC- fields, allowing you to use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are excluded after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, you can either use the button or switch to the next picture, the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Apart from the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, it is always conducted if you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation of the evaluation scheme is used from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. encoding is followed by the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keyword, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the previously used in this & digiplug; session applied.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is adjusted dynamically to the set search word. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of sampling during a photo series. if you have typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword may also be set by selecting the respective suits in tree. all keywords of the image are stored into the keyword in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword-tree, if you do not want to select a keyword, if you want to select a keyword with a keyword, please read the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The bar chart is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. usually, the left side bar will be used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if additionally, one or more keyword filters are displayed on the right side. all created keyword will be available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and leave. accepted several pictures in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag it out from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then, a dialogue, which you asks if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is selected on one keyword. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword will be taken on the right-tree on the selection and then put it there. a dialogue asks if this keyword will be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also be switched off settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it must be one or be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry according to the database is chosen. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group. the options look like this:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mainly adapted to & digial; s addressed implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you set a color-managed workflow, which is the colors created by your camera or scanner, you can achieve a predictable deviation from which of your camera or scanners are equal to those of which you print, or scanners, or in the web, publish them from your digital nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on color management, everybody wants to press what buttons he wants to express it. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should get links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows meet all criteria of six below, then you don't need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor that has been calibrated at sRGB colour space. (for further information you will find below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are by e-mail or the Web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works as well and the life for all so simple, why should you use another colour space and have to make thought about color oil?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors which we can see, the hug-shaped region, and the colours in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some bigger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms's page and then click on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kill my monitor, if I decided to work in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you want to work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to convert your monitor (RGB mode) that your monitor is connected to sRGB. if you use it as the colour space of sRGB, you need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve a picture in most cases. use it before you try to process an additional manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, decreasing automatic and contrast expand the menu automatically try to make the best possible from your colors. you'll need to experiment the best with these effects, which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the entire image, so that the dark point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without its color shaded. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adjust the illuminance of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the Intellectuality is the same number of pixels. sometimes, it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast increase: this method improves contrast and the luminous intensity of RGB values of a picture by the move the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white cover of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out white pictures of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is a bit restricted because of a colour space with 8-bits per color. if you are able to perform areas with overexposure. if you are able to perform white drops in the raw mode, which means that your possibilities can fall better in the 16-bit mode.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a Weißabequivalent algorithm in the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. it will start with menu entry colors white and image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the tool image. if you want to see the original whipped, then it is enough to click on the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos comes with a red marker. the Luminance of Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram will appear, once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, most pixels very small Luminant values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows adjust the shadow ails of your photos or also down dimms.</seg>
<seg id="401">Tighstat with the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and then click on this button to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white pattern. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white pictures with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The coating dictator boosts the colors when more than one color channel has been overexposed. this will display the combined result in a white indicator. this is shown in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and store are exactly this. each adjustment of the Weißabequs you can set you to back in a text file and later reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will return all filter values again on their standard value and the corresponding neutral white cover. note that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original. if you save this image, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can set the codification depth of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the wide spread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images but also needs more disk space, calculates and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog for processing pipe images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.The color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helds. an detailed manual for use of colour profiles can be taken into the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu among colors. this tool provides a built-in path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so you can use it for several photos. this is helpful when your camera or Scanner do always need the same error. in the manual for sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; Tool Color effects provides four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, an effect of the image has been inverted. the colored, darker areas protected and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically is possible. another increase produces a negative image that is not so on to generate photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation point that makes it a stronger contrasting effect which makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name designed for a light-engineered color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. Velvia provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers strongly saturated color colors, but also some photographers, especially those who hardly believe in landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on contrasts. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repetitions the strength of the neonlight. for large pictures the filter can deliver the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lightness of the photos. you can use the different color-effects of your photos below colors. as soon as you are satisfied with the result you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo at bad lighting conditions, you can get the converted problem. also in this case, you can reduce the saturation instead of saturation. if the result you can perform the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchattage / contrast / Gamma, the tool provides sound correction to improve exposure. also, if the dialog is very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. in concrete, the three shooting down below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three keepers of the image are clicked, and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the light areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to move the control knobs, how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can view the original and preview of the picture. the preview will be dynamic, using the settings of the picture. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, if the histogram is displayed with linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called Gammaze.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinout can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each range. there are also two controllers possible to modify the output values for example. the compression of the output values can be used as background can be used as background to create something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically placed in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the selected values can be saved in the file system and later reloaded. to this, the Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted to all shadow, means and sunny, and click the preview of the original image to replace the histogram's input, green, blue and the Luminanzas.</seg>
<seg id="430">The coating dictator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels. this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue Channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, and the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Change channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cage, two symbols are located between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant colour is created. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">When you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are correspondent and the corresponding picture pixels will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker. if you want to change this marking on the corner you will change a right line on this line and move it on this line and move it on and down, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and shop: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve can have created you in the file system and later be loaded. the file format is the Gimp Kurdish format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to use this method and the three colour pipettes buttons, the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadows, central and solar panels. enable the color pipette to use the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The coating dictator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than a channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminant channel. shadow and sunshield was used and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color shaded shots of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour range of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference as you can correct the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview of The original can be viewed compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target features a red marker. if you are positioned in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: knob for red, green and construction allows you to keep these channels. if you add Luminance, this is especially convenient if you can also activate the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you can also enable the option to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color is visible on the same place in the channel channel and its room pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion into which you first reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can be stored for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The coating dictator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels. this is a indicator that is displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo shown in the blue Channel. the option Luminance Store is activated. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photographs, black / white one work step, since colour pictures can easily be converted to the machine. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>

<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter. this looks good enough for all scenic images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linear filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulated a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic fall effects and simulate moonies to the day-time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while keeping a bit cold in the shadows. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatric. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; Tool texture apply, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless if it is a colour image or not, you can look like a oil painting on a screen, a pop art portrait out of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture. image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three dimensional of texture on the picture.</seg>

<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. continuously inhibit the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and white pictures), it adds a cute three-dimensional frame and decoratively add a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the frame width in percent. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of images, especially if you have used the tool.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert an formatted text in an image to any arbitrary place. this is also possible when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use Textile direction, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its features like you need. you'll just select a frame about the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you push the button "OK" if the image is saved once, the text part of the picture is not changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using & digiplug; Tool Templates apply to a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template approaches to image processing can be used to put templates across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions about the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and you should want to add your template-size (9) to compare your template-size to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you have to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you will select the template files.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of a template's template. the selection of a folder is automatically updated.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>

<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. if you want to use the mouse. if you want to enlarge the template on the whole picture, you must decrease the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template picture. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">OK, if you want to use the template onto your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but particularly in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. it is not a bit more psychedelic. they can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is that the digitization of colors will be printed. this again shows that sharp edges are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need greater sharpness than normal cameras for the private user application.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera internal sharpness is often used. images in the case-format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner will already apply a sharpensive filter during the reading of the image. if you deactivate it, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening sharpening. you can correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should get careful because the results don't work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can correct further information on the menu entry. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to correct softness is much easier than it. use the menu to correct softness, and experiment some with settings. the dialog box on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often stimulated good results and should always be tried out. if you make the sharpness mask to strongly make the noise and the impression of atrocities in the vicinity of sharp edges will create.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents like many pixels on each side of a channel through the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness will be set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and to apply difference amount. you can define areas with a soft switching between tones of sharpening, and therefore, beauty parabnormalities are avoided in face, pouring and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; Tool Refocuses on a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to move a picture to & quot; refocusing on photo. this is better to try the photo. it uses a technique named FIR Viennese Filters. the traditional technique for sharpening images is mostly used as unsharp masking. you can start it out of the menu by using colors refocusing on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fission works much better than the Gauß's Fits. the GIR Viennese Inverse is also influenced by the source pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse of Gauß's Fission is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. this causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Body sharpness: this is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unblurred but then on Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be measured from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: increase the smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 may be extremely rare. if the noise filter is too low, & eg. 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0,03. a high value will continue to sooner.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you might have to increase the correlation and / oderm filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value is determined to generate good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any arbitrary parameters will be set to you and can then be loaded for later and then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimming, color, and intensity tubes on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately, but later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should Apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is possible to remove artifacts. for the Viennese filters you can see that the optimal lineup filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothing relies the sharpness of the area of the darkened, to create a natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tine allows an adapted color for the Pupille. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool designed to remove artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Indie Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform glasses about the picture. for larger values, mainly homogenous regions should get further necessary. please note that no sharpening is needed. please note that it should always be subject to the accuracy of accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD smokers, a high value wavy-like pattern will produce a high value with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value accordingly to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is believed to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Drop-up da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. consider that small angles should be a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step distance [0,1, 10]: integrated step distance in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the multi-quality feature is only low. it doubles but the running time. we therefore recommend it to allow him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast when working. but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after it. therefore, you can cancel the calculation using the button demolition anytime.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see image errors with little artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera that is caused by a bad film location during the trip. the original image is seen below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts, i.e. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor surfaces from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor surfaces from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain-grab noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need details and the advanced settings of the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for filter. great values increase the time the filter is measured via the picture and the color in it is smoothes and therefore minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharper-level. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter according to the front panel. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details may not get more and noise or lubrication can occur.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it can't occur at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the light tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings can not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerability of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the tolerance intolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance limits of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but polluted also the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is high, the roughness and phasenjitter can occur in the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and shop: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for noise reduction you have set, can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how cracks can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the predatory reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too big for your purpose. the solution to disclose the image a little soft, it's easier than a painting with the menu entry correct softness and experiment with the smoothpaste on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo file.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filters for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's Rauschen, Film-körút, Crater, Komatters, Komatzer, and subsequent digitalized images in digital, original or subsequent digital images as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm is used for colour and texturing. the text is developed with another tool that was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, he creates some compression & quot; - small standards that are uncompressed in uncompressed image. this setting is correct to correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and store are exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast when working. but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after it. therefore, you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="551">Here you can reduce like a photo with equered catches. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the faces. the original image is below (1) and that is corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which have been viewed by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; Tool Hotpixels are allowed to remove Hotpixels of photos that were using a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGNAi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw material, as many cameras with JPEG compression above have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelot. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark picture. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image review.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the appropriate dark picture to the correct image. please note that the wizard is the last dark picture, and automatically reloads this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and preview help you correct within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the following filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durham: it's an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which then is used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction in a colour photo, resulting from a faulty digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignettierungscorrection is a tool to correct the vables, i.e. the exposed corners to correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium sized and large photo format, you can frequent the entire sensor area not evenly illuminated. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the light that reaches the sensor there. teleobjective clearly show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 when it is impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should be possible, also with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise otherwise unsharpened effects are created by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and colour scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation to a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regiments, you can control the correction-correction filter and with three further exposures of the target device.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light output at the point of the highest density. the standard density is 2.0, which compensate an optical filter with a aperture of 1, or randomly compensate the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vignetrics.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstarch, contrast and gamma attitudes: the editing of a picture with the Vignettierungscorrection decreases the light intensity of the pixel. they have to adjust only positive values, because you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine re-adjustment of the target image, so let the values for light intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the votation correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the corrected image in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a Leuchimpke- und contrasting correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lenticular distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grader does the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third ridge has a similar round effect, but flat on the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of code corrects the remote corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two geometrical distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grades. with negative values can be corrected tonnenular distortion and beneficial values of colluous distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion-fourth degree. this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter had the default character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is scaled down the image size and thereby emphasizing the first gradient. negative values enlarge positive the image while positive.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightly: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correct. the values are stored for your image and use the default value as default.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cichannular correction should be performed before all trimming or magnitude changes. best perform this correction as all first through. if you cut a picture, and then a tonnenular correction might be the effect immediately.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to find you this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to a key place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your image, and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. in connection, you can correct the tonn- / clerical distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a collude distortion, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove this with the trimming tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonnenular correction comes from the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnenular correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared feature of the Gimpguru.org website. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview. when you move the red rectangle with your mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film-graze and film-sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate the grain size of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of movie grains and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels are mixed with infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filming effect on a land photo made of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type Aura in the leading lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filters film trader is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer great silver-grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The movie grains gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. the treated photo gets a timeless atmosphere of loose daily life. if you want to get this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained sight especially in your monochroms photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is needed, though often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like a oil painting. nature pictures and breastfeeding are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush can be better for large pictures. smoothing or, from the other side considered, the hinged.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original image is marked with (1) and that is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and glasses 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">& digiplug; filters charcoal drawing used colour and intensity gradients to define a cabbage sketop. images whose gradients can change slowly, therefore, if you imagine, what scene you should have chosen to sketop. this would be good pictures to get started.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator elects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (glasses).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal-label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">& digial; filters engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important at content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monarch landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2) is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an art work using distortion effect. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and leaves it like it is visible through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted to another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an art work with sharpness effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wiped out the picture along sternails lines run from a center. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Dispity: wiped the picture by rotation of the pixels to focus. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Visual acuity: to produce the image to create a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement sequences: wiches the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the infinity of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photovoltaics, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Attention: the image is softened in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dream and brilliant focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Check-in: wiped the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a randomly moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: find the Farmers in the picture and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: split the picture in rectangular cells and then created it, new features with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural your images a native appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allowed to change the size of the drip. as the drip size is not automatically increased with size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the number and density of drops. fish changes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use & digiplug; image processing is able to keep a range of raindrops. use the range of tools for example a face, which should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the range will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers turning or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo Bubble is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is simple. the big question is, how can you find an image sound and the details sharp? how can you get the missing information? how can you find the missing information here? how can you find the missing information here? how can I see the missing information here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the size of the size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool can change a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try to inflate the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying Algorithm Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the Tabs New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is enabled, the input of the new size is retained in the image aspect of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is believed to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and load are used exactly. every single-loading for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo Bubble is very fast when it makes it, but it can still take a long time and get a high CPU load after it. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflatable by taking a small color picture to the double size. the original (1) and the extended image (3) is the result of the linear standard augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only an frequently performed surgery, but also a common underestimated tool to cut a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo simply by pressing the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and move the rectangle that you will see the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut out. thus you can change a good overview of your photo after cutting it. you can create a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you're satisfied with the cutting window, use the button 1 button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut out (Ctrl; + X). use the Save In File menu to save the new cut-out photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners to the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialog, remains in the way.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mold. after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and in the width of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool requires a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always equal to whether you use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons on the selection exist automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set the maximum ratio of the area to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool allows you to cut the settings depending on the aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the trimming tool, these settings are stored as a default value in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the image and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">Help the settings of the screening help allow help to assemble your pictures better. these assistants are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. such as the third-party, harmonious triangles have the possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is the golden middle of a variety of natural growth smiles, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shells or the blueprints of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, that thus used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you assemble your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is directed by the Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition of this rule is as a visually harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The Golden Center provides smoother support lines if you get a picture. these assistants are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">Golden Spirale will give you good results for your photos. compared to third-party, the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer along the line of spirals and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye can turn in the centre of the composition. it can be one line or different objects. this is simply just as being without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles have also derive from the above-mentioned gold spiral. her vertex points are the middle points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles have no equivalent triangles. Diagonal to place these lines can be transformed into a static object dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to create your frame, create a effect of professional photographic dynamic symmetry. try to place your picture focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic subdivisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things rotated with an angle. you can select this using the & digiplug; Edit free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown above.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help, the module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to position the two lines. after you can fix it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you've turned an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function of transformers cutting them from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivic transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image is slightly dirty. this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">Once you have adapted the perspective, you will have unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to bersome this is the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The lock tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction to postpone and the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module using transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your picture by using the horizontal corners and vertical corners. you can display horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you indicate preadjustments, the angle will be displayed to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right from the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, like the Lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shot, the image is usually negligible. for a single layer, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shells is doubling much more frustration, and therefore, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the picture has the beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats and, in some cases, by type such libraries compiling. in most distributions you will have a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras can even choose to use the format that can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smooth results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save loss-free if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw material format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can further convert resource format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from & digiplug. in the section configuration, you can further information about the use of modules with & digiplug;</seg>

<seg id="812">Picture Geographical Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. in order to upload a possible correlation between time and localization, you will have to upload a possible correlation between time and localization. this file contains the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation was performed in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore must be converted to GMT using the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera age. the deviation is below the data collected. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a trace data from one place, you can edit the GPX file and add to the images. the difference difference of 2000 seconds is then correlated to all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't know that in reality a locating difference between camera and GPS, you can use these limits and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set manually if you have done a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog you need to use a number of photos on the same place, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and found with the displayed map and increase it. select this always through, until you have reached an enriching accuracy. the map must always be manually selected. the map can be switched between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the pictures. here's a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums created as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded as UTF-8 to facilitate the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four horsemen to choose the settings. you need to select all albums that are exported to HTML. you need to select these albums only. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, it will appear on the right page and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side. this rider is largely explained. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images. choose a folder from the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy the data from a picture to another. then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target picture dialog, so you want to copy the image dialog. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function is not working with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. please look at exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG code is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a Div.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert selected images. you can also add a basic image file between the individual pictures you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size of the video format. additionally, you can use a background color for your DVD. with this module it is possible to burn the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first be packed into the pictures that are packed into the MPEG Diaschau. then you can start the module through extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should be able to customize the other settings. if you are planning the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds. the speed of the image will be specified. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt you should leave them black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep it possible as if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file, you can start the movie into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly, or enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the Diaschau if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below button settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print several pictures on a paper paper together with standard photogreddish. this is also possible to print directly with image processing Gimp. this is useful to print or print using the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert any images stored in one RAW format to JPEG, TIFF, or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him does not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to adjust the conversion process. the key parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're happy with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-proof algorithm and produce the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and use the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to process your pictures frequently, or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before changing the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to JPEG as a memory format, the metadata file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can cancel this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stapling mode allows you to convert various images to one time. if you are sure, for example, use a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures. however, this is helpful, however, to write existing file automatically. this is helpful, if this is not available in an earlier trial. a preview of progress is not available as far as the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can set the prefix, starting from the starting point and the timestamp of the module.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal magnitude in a dimension. width or height of the image will automatically be selected, depending on the aspect ratio, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 d.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportioned size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user may set pressure resolution and size of the photo screen. the target picture, including backsize, edge size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to draw the size of the additional images before. further pictures can be taken on the list of attractive pictures and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the picture window will be displayed by you. add a file selection dialog. you can add additional images with a file selection dialog. for the last updated image the picture is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the list of images and add them to the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected images are removed from the list of attractive pictures from the list of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images you can open the new message window of your e-mail clients here. you can only add the addresses and the bedding. the pictures selected from you are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails. it may possibly send a good idea to send several emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration will be saved and ever used until you modify it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Choose your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in an attached file the comments to the images are joined together in a text file and teach the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted below the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you don't need to have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">When you select JPEG pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original Exifdata are added to sening images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so that your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. your e-mail program is automatically set up at the end. you can connect this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diaschau appears a window with questions such as you want to see your Diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation also use OpenGL by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graph card, otherwise the Diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file names indicate that the filename of the images in the left-hand corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then break manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option photographs randomly select that the images are displayed in random order, so the sequence of pictures are not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images, the temporal distance between the individual pictures are set. 1500 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should get out before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly selects between images a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a tool bar at the top left screen. move your mouse to this corner by you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the lower edge screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the whole number of pictures in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures after specific name, as you can see in the picture. here is pictures, however, not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum; if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather like functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go on the homepage of & photoalbum; and check out the quickenter, the image files and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Play on a photoalbum; and select in the first dialog box, if you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry on photoalbum; - Demo. a few example will be loaded and you can test the functions of & photoalbum; try out.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photoalbum; presents you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images. the one is available in & photoalbum; integrated and the other than module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, it is described in & photoalbum; integrated version that you can create about the HTML file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are subdivided into the three areas of contents, layout and target. in the following, every area will be more accurately described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the square and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example-pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & phone album and export file should be created, which is to be seen on the review page. do information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages which can be displayed without description that all images are exported without description. please note that all images are exported without description. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages look like. most adjustment possibilities are clear, so this is not specially formulated.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of this page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution of 800x600, no pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">Viewing your site can change the resolution at any time. it can thus change your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it's a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At the best, choose a basic folder for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new folder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and then automatically updated to all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check whether this really can select a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL, which can be set here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created you do not have in the final destination folder, you must manually copy it manually. in order to specify the import function, please do not need to specify the final destination of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder where all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The basic settings described can be converted every three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be set, whose name you can define into output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; you can, of course, you may have a HTML page for viewing the images, you'll need to add a HTML page for this, then you'll have to do with a photoalbum; this work did not even happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photoelectric debut album, you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import and import other images to your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file itself, whether the pictures are stored in the file, or whether you can set all images in the file, so you can pass all images. the obvious downside is, however, the file size is.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file, either directly from the menu Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">A external .kin file searches the images in two times. first, the pictures are not found, so the images of the URL, which you have specified in the file of the .kim file, is naturally only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can export to the file file Export....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is if it is about internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">For the Manuals option, copy the images to the .kim file, copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the images automatically to the .kim file, copy the images automatically for you to download the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not worthwhile to compress the files if you want to compress the output file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum size size limit. if you don't want to send your friends pictures, as the .kim file would be very large, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can say that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and broad.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file... select, it will import & pack album as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, in which folders will be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can choose the category persons of imported file Personer (if you are a Dane), while this category is needed in your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog box, which are to be imported into the categories of imported file and correspond to these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can offset the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. for example, see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse pictures and watch pictures: if you see images, you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend, you may want to see all the images on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from the (1) place of information about your images, through (2) the searches and prestige, through to (3) advanced topics and adapting possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was begun as a program for managing your images. but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual, about pictures are spoken, but frequently it closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all his images in the index.xml in the upper folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a diskette or revisions in CVS where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; noted the folder where your images are saved and used this with future Starts automatically. if you want to start a different folder with images, you can start a different folder with images, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings of the photoelectric debut album, you'll get to a window where you can change the settings of & photoalbum. in the following section of the user manual you will discuss the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call Settings options and options for viewing the viewer. for every adjustment you can open a detailed help on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">This is described you as you can set for each image various features, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to process existing groups already existing groups. for every existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories already mentioned. in the dialogue options, you can set complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one medias.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the installation options you want to configure the membership groups. with the above selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface. Click on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules can have a help page you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with several applications, it can be used to test the modules with a photoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the command &gt; cphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I couldn't have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules work with & photoelectric debut album; not working. this is the disadvantage when you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums: this sort of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulates & photoalbum; the latest album, which is just corresponds to the current view, so all images that shows you the picture preview</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the latest album & photoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here's a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & photoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then every entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will select the category which you have set in the settings dialog as a Category for virtual albums, so if you do not use the category people, so whether you have selected people to view this module and keep it on the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with a photoelectric sensor; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules and select the settings dialog, and select modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you have a photoalbum; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">Just like you are used by any other KDE applications, you can see the window above, as you can see your image database. at the moment we will see you no more information about your pictures, but then click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photoalbum; is the option to see any picture with comments, where the image has been added to the picture where the image has been shown separately or for a larger number of images. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want to see these comments if you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by clicking on people, locations and words. these are a very important part of & photoalbum, as you can always use it again if you want information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the move of the images within the list: if you have depicted a family celebration, and on all 50 images you can see the same 5-10 persons, you can find that the used names are moved up to the above, to find and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image separately, you may wish to edit each selected pictures and have the images with notes. Click on this case simply to the above and back buttons, which are located at the preview of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. in order to indicate that it is a headset, a special icon will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the attentive dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or subcategory. in addition, you can also take an entry to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you can sort your categories alphabetically. see it.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the attentive dialogs by clicking the glue that make the upper edge of the frame, click and move them out of a frame, by moving it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so on your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on button Options..., which offers the option to save the actual design and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to display this window later, use the button options... and here window is a / outgoing. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will have an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you do not have a filter. you can configure the size of the preview window by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be decorated as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this is displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture above. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press either the edit menu or select the Edit menu. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; for this problem, you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures anywhere you have saved on your hard drive. in the picture you can see the pictures of & photoalbum; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut out, are not stored on the hard disk. this is, i.e., for the pictures 5-9, however, the preview of pictures are available, so you can see the preview of these pictures. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">Just like you see this function you need to see files from the folders and then copy them back. if you want to avoid the insertion of the specific CD, please do not support the insertion of your images, please get a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you would like a little more privacy, you can select the images so that you can see for other unaccessible. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister, conteuing and unlock the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus you have set out what pictures should be hidden in the case of your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, allowing all the images that you can be locked, click to lift up the images again.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which has to be entered for unlocking the images. to order this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very safe. for example, everybody can read or delete all images on the index.xml. this type of password protection is only allowed to recover the password as unencrypted text; not very familiar with & photoalbums; not very familiar with the view on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and watched over hours, of course that you want to look at some time. from this reason & photoalbum; over a picture _ and video viewer. you can look at this preview as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows the picture, but additional information you can enter on the picture, like who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the InfoBox on the upper part of the picture, you can also configure and configure it anywhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer's right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will display you all the pictures from Anne Helene. if you have selected all the pictures from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and back, by using the buttons on top and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as a slide, and you can press a new picture after a few seconds. just like a new picture, you can press the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus. start and stopped by pressing the Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful skill of the viewer's slide-album, is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>

<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed, so it puts the zoom in the screen that each pixel is equivalent to the screen at a pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work with videos that are in and out-zooming with the plus and mint paste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can turn the picture from the context menu. this doesn't work with videos. you can view notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on paper to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start with the pictures and you can see it as good or poorly mark, while being one after another.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture is reduced with only one beam each pixel. these images often have a Moirè-pattern or stucco effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam ever pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapting the super-sampling. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is always subdivided and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray supports a beam ever pixel. if the difference between color values will be adjusted in pixels with super-sampling rate, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged if you need additional beams per pixel at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference is shared between the color values the given threshold is divided into 4 subpixels, which can be checked separately and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the review can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, change & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, diffuse reflection reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box map, you can adjust if the alpha-channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpected, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray; to import the menu entry, select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler is currently supported; yet not the complete command range of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support spring text in & kpovmodeler, please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawner.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can use objects from object-tree in the editor to import the source text for & Povray; to import the source text file into the editor. to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste into & crpovmodeler, and in your editor you can add source for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & crpovmodeler is a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click the Help button, opens & crpovmodeler, the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your documentation and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the eques for the field of view in the camera-view and in the window type markings.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catches of points to the Raster in the context menu of the wire Model Views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and filings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Greater values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects but require more time to rendering. for some objects, e.g. the ball, you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detailed projections for extended projections, all wire-to-extended projections are used, all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is placed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross floor, a floor is placed below the objects. the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantonal release, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of scenes are used. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Excel modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section of window orders, how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window rules: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler, uses the chosen window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of Extendable window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window of window is identified by name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name indicates all the views of the selected window order. new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views by the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new window position. with the new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window, using cartridge card, you receive a cartel side view together with the previous view and suspended the view inside the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just like & Povray; and & crpovmodeler, installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide you should create the ultimate in simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you'll get as a result only a black screen. if you want to use a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything flawlessly installed, take a look at the first start of & crpovmodeler:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and using the toolbar icons. read the documentation to get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often need to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& crpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model View shows how the camera looks the whole scene, which you generate. in particular, please note that the scene from the scene is from the camera's point of view. this is the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. when clicking on it, see the content of the view object properties that can be found in the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera in the view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. Click on the right button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button or press the Enter key, the wire Model Views and the object-tree immediately change these settings. as a result, see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could set a quader (insertion body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a consistent method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& crpovmodeler, indeed, provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the button or press the button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model indicates now also the level, if at the moment only a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you'll notice that you can see the default value for every new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box, where you can choose to be inserted as the object is set. please select the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the Pigments only shows a flat-black material because you have to set settings for the pigment. do so always remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. there is now many possibilities now, but take the simplest thing now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on quader and ball, click the button on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you get your picture with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colour. you can enter two new attributes. in the color list you need two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also use this entry twice, but the box color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step is already easy to run, as you should have understood the basic operation of & crpovmodeler. the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius: if you don't forget to push the button on the ground. otherwise, the ball is pig on the ground, as you have to postponed the ground to a unit downward.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears as a matte black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can assign a material now. as already in the ground, enter the ball as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the first object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. Click on Sphere Pigment, then select one-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time, make some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following displays and click the Enter</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection result already produces good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that possibilities you & crpovmodeler. hopefully, you've already learned so much you can create simple scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a pure method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene is hypothetical radiation from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) by every pixel. the Render will be reflected and the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how to act as atmospheric effects like mists. so the scene is being processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see you without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source, you'll find nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have to create with & crpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Always, if you open a new model, or create the file in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. it's a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Showcases the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only then select if you don't have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last changed command. this menu entry can only then select when you use editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window direction and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing setup.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & crpovmodeler, here you can change the appearance, the keyboard shortcut, and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog box to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for Device toolbar. you can add and remove toolbars for & crpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is an option to modulate rough surfaces without changing any hives on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a Bump-Map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms, which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies. these models will continue to be processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser which allows you to view images.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The usage of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on & LMBN; or key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any picture is displayed in a own window or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. when a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialogue setting - & kuickshow; there are five cards cards. in three, General and machining and slideshow, you can set the operation of & ball show; in the two others, Shortcuts for the browser window and Shortcuts for the browser, you can set the key shortcuts for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are open in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color, which you can adjust below. default is no full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loads & ball show; already look at the next picture in the folder, while you are still looking for the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">This option stores & ball show; when moving the name of the last opened folder. at the next start & kuickshow opens this folder in browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to select a background color. if in window mode, the window is larger than the image is larger than the picture is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can setup & kuickshow; so, only some of the file types are displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window extends to the full screen for larger images. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Select whether the slideshow is to start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time period between the image changes in slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider and the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until they change from the user. to change the value, you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Click here the keyboard shortcuts for the different operating modes of & ball show; in the box cards short commands for the display window and Shortcuts for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the second-part of the file system (a window for files and a window for files) and one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists and scripts:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok hasn't added some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependence on whether all necessary modules are available and use the dialog, making the user identification, why a script is not running.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP you can exchange your scripts data using Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; that each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. this is usually called exec (). this way, dcop &gt; can be called upon this way. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are continuously used to monitor the default of scripts and respond accordingly to events. of course, one script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>

<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adapt the grouping entirely to your popularity.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will change your collection automatically if you own a bit at the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar is a searchfilter. it stops in the list view as well as in the construction supervision as well. notes on the list of this filter in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you can find a selection box, whose help you can add the last added pieces to your collection of the collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. Moreover, you can also choose your total collection, which is virtually indexed to the filter.</seg>
<seg id="1368">With the right mouse button, click on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Download - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Hang on playlist - add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds you to the selected pieces into the queue. this function will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlist. you will be asked for a name, under which the list shall be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer them to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to the media player. further details can be found in the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter burn / Burn burning, and burn the selected pieces to K3b and burn either as data or as audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move to the trashcan move... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, which appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Compilation-marking - Change the selected album back into a normal album. the album is no longer displayed under different musicians, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browsers specifically designed to deal with many playlists. among other things he also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists are the smart playlists. this utilisation & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. Click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Intelligent playlist. there you can enter all necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The sub-window media player is used for connecting & Amarok; for example, to be connected to your iPod with & Amarok; it has to be connected to your iPod to Interpret; in / mnt / ipod. if it is started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret, sorted into the upper list of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, draw the songs out of the playlist and let them be uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is completed, exit & Amarok; and solve the drive connections for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you can find a search range which you can search for a file. search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hatched, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, you'll find an address bar where you can view music from a set URL. if you can view music from a set URL, you can view music in the music file musi.tar.gz. now you can draw the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer becomes longer than in the window, the trailer of files can be easily helpful. in the case, the festival menu can be helpful automatically at the end of the list, and not at the bottom of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of you the playlist. you can change the order by default the entries to the desired place where you can enter a filter. once you enter the letters, click the button to reset the letters, until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms through space, & Amarok; search for entries which contain all search terms. if you contain one two three, the search will find all entries, one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you are selected between the search terms OR, select either the one or the other keyword. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all the pieces are found, one or two or three or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you are looking for entries to search the spaces, then connect the keyword with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will not include Mike Oldfield, not but after entries, such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific keyword, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: &gt; 50th This is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you would like to look for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, ask a minus sign before the search term: -something looking for pieces that are not included.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations after each other. example: Mike Oldfield OR Pfeiffer: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order, then select a label with a number. the number corresponds to the sequence, in which the pieces will be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom edge of the window. you will find buttons for some functions of playlist. on the left you can add the button Add to the playlist, playlist empty and Randomly mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons are reverse and restoring. you can make changes to the playlist or restore.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar, a unique, enlarged analyzer. the loading rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you can see in the Player-window via the right mouse button. on this menu you can setup & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many further available buttons for the tool bar, for example rendition and volume control. you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and choose toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information for playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status of random mode and recovery can easily change by clicking the mouse twice into the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also disable the status bar even. if you deactivate the Status Bar option in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by a click with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist menu. on this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the windows visualisation plugins. you can select the visualizations from & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can start by clicking the Cover Cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by clicking on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the menu View, you can choose what to be displayed in the Cover Administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue administration has received its great suit in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have more control over the playlist. this number represents the order, in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">The administration of the queue open a piece on extras queue. if you want to add a piece in the playlist and then click on +. you can also add the pieces into the playlist. the sequence of pieces you can change in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, of which two are already pre-given (the details about the establishment of this follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further accidental pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces, based on last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio crobbler). this mode requires that some pieces have already been installed in your playlist. this mode does not require this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double on the playlist, go to the playlist window or click the right button of the playlist. this way, your current playlist is replaced by the new playlist, so you should save the old playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes of random mix and playlists mix immediately complete your playlist and you can add the playback directly from your collection. the Recommended pieces will always be added to your collection at the end of the first piece, therefore your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, then activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. through the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The button New filling the latest playlist and adds new features according to the dynamic mode. playlist opens the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">With a right click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click on Edit. then the dialog for editing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Place any name for playlist. however, the name should be unique, however, to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">When this setting is not active, your playlist will continuously grow, and they will not exceed the setting for coming pieces. if the setting is active, the already played pieces under respect of the setting are mirrored pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Split pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are kept at the beginning of the playlist. thus, you can easily see which pieces have been played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added after each played piece on playlist. if you want to grow more then 1, the playlist is played continuously, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right-hand side were already described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialogue, you can already choose existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross several playlists, & Amarok; random songs from each of the crossed playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on setup.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; scripts that can install on script by clicking the script. after you install the script, you can install a new entry into the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the internet. use the button to get further scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method to reopened recently opened projects. the corresponding sub-menu contains a list of these projects. one click brings up the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Save the current project. if the project has been saved once, the file created before, otherwise, will be asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialogue Save is displayed, where you can select folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Stores all opened projects. this is the same as if you would like to save the file for each single project.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and not saved, ask & K3b; according to what happened. you can then switch between storing and changes. furthermore, you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>

<seg id="1461">Includes all opened projects and finished & K3b;. for each not stored project, what should happen if you had called it.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you call this entry, you can select the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files in the base folder will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same thing as the characteristics-dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button Burn, the & K3b. the burning dialog can only open if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can create many project-related settings. every project type has different possible settings, most of them about what is this? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD project. it is useful to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful, even if you are using files for a multi-session CD, even if this function is not used when using existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD project. this function prompted & K3b;, imported files from the current project. all other files will be removed from the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it blends only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copy dialog. this also allows you to burn a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also just burn a picture of a CD where you prefer to burn CDs instead of the normal copy. you should also prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copy dialog. this also allows a DVD to create a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also use a DVD with the help of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog. furthermore, the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1478">The summarizes a or out. the summaries allows to select and pull-off files into the project view. the summarizes is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder.</seg>
<seg id="1479">If the header line switches on or off. the header bar is a narrower range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it looks pretty nice and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the keyboards for & K3b; after one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key order below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistants. thus, the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs are required. therefore, system administrators must be required for system administrators (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here, the settings can be made. almost all functions of & K3b; should work on time. this dialog is intended for Personalize and Fine-Adjustment of the Program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many others & kde; applications also, with one & DCOP; interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command-line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are crucial in the function scope, therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which gives you the accompanying program.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command-line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions you need to make sure & K3b; and then enter something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program gems, support & K3b; mainly two other parts are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface of & K3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createaux-Project () DCOPref createMixedCDProject () DCOPref createznoxDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref create.com () DCOPref create.com () DCOPref create.com () DCOPref create.com () DCOPref createzvd () DCOPref createzvd () void burnCd () void burnCdImage () void burnd.dvdimage (KURL url) void burnDvdimage (KURL url) void burnDvdimage (KURL url) void burnDvdimage (KURL url) void burnd.dvdmedia (KURL url) void burnd.dvdimage (KURL url) void burnd.dvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXX project method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (K3b, K3bProject-0) Alternativ can change a reference on the project by using the # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject Through Use of this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurine (QString path) void rendition (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString newname) void-VolumeID (QString path, QString newname) void-VolumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop / home / trueg / shefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; -reading for & kde; with it easy audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD files on the hard drive) and by many codiers that supports these WAV files (without any lossless compression). other codiers can be added (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD are read and saved in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Will compress these WAV files in a second step (usually a pro title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD; it is compiled by & audiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, advertisement (for MP3), ogblabis (for OGG) or other codiers have already exist, so it's probably not necessary to compile any Linux distributions. however, it is not necessary to be needed too. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format should be used? the chapter of Welser Codiers provides a small introduction on codiers, audio quality, and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, Udparanoia is used to read the audio data from the & CD; it is not possible to read any copy protection. if not the firmware of the copy protection is not possible. avoid the purchase of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only one must be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration was found), will follow the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understanding the slender approach of user interface, which you will often be stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending of which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can use & CD; get information from FreeDB from the Internet or can work fully without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is a short list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step example, you will find further information, such as this program is used as well as monitors with descriptions of the program's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the installation of the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online in the latter case first must first be made to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the header settings in the setup mode - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it's note that the encoder's encoder settings can be configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a file extension is selected to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and to encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the configuration dialog to configure the messages of messages (such as protocols, pieves) for events (such as reading & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & audiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, to set encoders). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoding and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right coefficient.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats, which lose information through data compression, depending on your psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), however, the differences are less important because both codiers will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not as' free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG chipper is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices not only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame' help 'for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This adjustment should usually provide for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex tracks. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music of young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments without having to view the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or transferred by the FreeDB program via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the litters (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB is: a free database in which people can read / enter the information you can enter in the calculator so that all the other information can be entered into the calculator below: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (anm of the translation) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent the public on & CD; it's not permitted to be added to the artist or CD; more or less worthless, so the artists can still be associated with a Bummel. all information can be obtained from a & CD; business, physically, or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; actively use a check box (sending an address) to the use of FreeDB. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used when calling the server (this can only know the programmer, which has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when you use FreeDB, geographic will be used to use FreeDB. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirservern for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; or alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the retrieved WAV files, the codierer can be chosen to select the desired file format. at the first opening, there are predefined entries for advertisement (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before using the codierer. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codierer. more information about codiers are located in the chapter of Space Codierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codiers, more information about his switch may be obtained through the input of a command like lame-help or lame-help in a console window (eg; console). in this case, 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives which are installed and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to access both programs with a command line in one terminal. this might provide a hint of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope der & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter of step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but are somehow unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will need enough information to configure the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, we will start everything and our first & CD; read the '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files as it is not necessary to compile what you can do naturally.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the context).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & audiocreator; something of which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD;, which has to be repeated for every informing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the use of encoding for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are faul, we divide the program to use the FreeDB to download the FreeDB file.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings anytime, we will probably not be found at any reading of a & CD, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read it & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running process. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, so it can also display the effective device identification number if available in the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card Card General Settings. here's not much to do. here you can get an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be shown / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information you can select, so you will be informed when the information is missing from sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card box CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD to download data via the internet from a FreeDB calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading & CD; it can be connected to the Internet that it can access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry found, committing immediately the database name / file name or tag entries, you can easily change. the directory entry / file name will be changed easily and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagging.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter the list box and FreeDB. you can use FreeDB locally in off-line mode, if you want to use the database before. however, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. in mode the mode will be set up on the following cardboard box.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDB server to the Internet. how does the system that data will get the CD? read the details about FreeDB. read everything as shown in the screenshot of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your neighborhood. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts and this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both don't work on the server, as many Firewalls will bock the protocol 8880 standard, perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data on the FreeDB server. you should disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screenshot. (put sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously demonstrating pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive? do reading and code reading? the author knows not to try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD. after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are checked, then the path / folders can be specified in which the WAV files can be stored. if only space is not checked, the files will not be checked if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything is set like it on the screenshot one. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something to the right must be smiles to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the combined compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, more than a WAV file can be encode simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just have the basic set of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as default for every reading of a & CD; when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described, as described as the process of reading & CD; it is set up on the hard drive. we will build a link to the Internet, as we are conveniently and the & CD; data from the FreeDB to pick up. the process of this file is described in this section, must be repeated for every informing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we do not include a & CD, which is not yet included in FreeDB, the screen saver contains a little bit different from FreeDB. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieve it from the Internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD must now be defined; into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen saver, this only if the & CD can be identified as audio CD; identified and cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully collected from the FreeDB, all the titles of the pieces have already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that it's more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for automatic retrieval of FreeDB (on page & CD), you can manually trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you need to connect the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen in the first line of the 'Aktuell' title ', the rest of the data in the input field' album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist doesn't have to be entered in the input field 'Update', unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply for all CD's pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from FreeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to review the content of the CD Editors (e.g. all words with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this restricts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comment, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tag, you have set an unlimited field of field settings; this option will have a look inside the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tag.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the Help to receive more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which obviously is wrong with the style of the Next CD; this is not important because we do not transfer the & CD; data anyway. for further information, please refer to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', you come back to the main window. Click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The Windows-editor window appears and you see that the fields are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. enter the entries for the current piece. specify the title of the piece on each case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and proceed to the same way up to all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-in before each line of a piece. only the tracks are selected. simply click on the line to select all the pieces, or enter the button all the pieces on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If clicking on the button selection read the read process, this window appears to confirm. on OK, then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what it expires.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a codierer, which you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you write write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear how the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece that it is finished. but we have completed a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, reading and encode in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have any configuration settings to suppress this behaviour is the result of parallel processes for reading and encode. with an AMD64, no problem appears at the same time to read and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last number is coded, a small window will be coded for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator; you will need & kde; 3.partial or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the amount of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& audiocreator; if you are familiar with CVS; the most distributions do not include a pre-compiled package, since & kauditocreator; a part of an important & kde; package is. if you read this, you probably have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at individuals who compile the source files and not intended for users to use the pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for searching for your needs such as the program can be adjusted once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different other programs, has many variants of settings. best reading the step by step example to get the options and settings. it displays images of different card cards settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always read on? even if only the help menu has been clicked out of the program without any point of view such as it should go from this somehow empty screen (above all if the program starts at the time of the program boot), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What about it? who reads this, probably the program has started. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no E-Mail. the author cannot add this handbook. it is the first version to add or modify it. at least after contact with the author. and if you read this section, it has agreed to this section and therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -Window to the & kmid; window will also work with multiple songs.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and connect the button to play in the toolbar, select the entry to play from the menu or enter the Leapaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you go to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the Erection type will be automatically determined which you need to manually adjust the Karaoke text. but they still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an erecstal type, select from the menu Settings menu entries and songs. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are the range after abbey. in this section, how you can use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find in the menu collection under the Point Organize.... Click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired output in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns that you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to add a song. it appears in the file dialog with its help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will be added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection, the temporary collection will be activated and activated. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and desired tune then click here.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can choose the sequence in which the songs can be played. if you choose the menu from the menus sequence of the menus, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or choose songs or accidental sequence in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the Next button next song, next song, or press the arrow pointing right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button-predict piece, the entry predefined piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the deleting collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, it doesn't matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus, whenever a trumpet should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you just have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. AWE and CIS cards, FM-Devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the respective file by hand (with your favourite card).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Define CHANNELMAP...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for Options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail to which I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, how the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the parc character is ignored. it is assumed that GM's patches must not change in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to insert all sounds which support this instrument to the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can have a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which have the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a patch with Patch 127 (defensive), it accepts Patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which audio is encoded in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, if any sound is another percussionist instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the tone pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP paragraph, the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and any instrument. you have to use different keymaps only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to train sounds on the percussions-channel. watch as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to replicate some channels on others. if you want to debit the first and second channel, simply make it easy in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a designated channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section, thus 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is the channel, which is used on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must naturally use the name name for this channel. if you try to modify the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the perimeter-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch BenderRatio can be multiplied in which ratio Pitch-Bender. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event. if so, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to do not decimalkommas in the Map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is predefined that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a Pitch-Bender event. unfortunately, some keyboards can play with two sounds up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI-map, simply open the dialog box MIDI settings. you can find in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel screen is a window with an entire pivatures (one for each MIDI channel). you can see what sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the Channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed one instrument, if you have changed one instrument, the button does not have more green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to indicate the played tones. view the view menu settings under the point of Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a music piece must be played. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but you need a similar sound quality. but a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you need a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have compiled a binary-distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens, because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Enable to activate the Automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files for temporary collection will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch the buttons on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've got on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a Karaoke file, or if I want to play a file, merely go to the & konqueror; -window, and draw the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without them to add to a collection, turn the setting automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us take you, you have the MIDI Files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. just want to play the first file. so, set the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open Amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join forces to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animated me to program on & kmid;</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to remove the preferred compounds under the menu bookmarks, but this is individual entries. if you want to play a list of entries, you should use the thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical step. if you have an entry, his group and all its subsets will be copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the clicked entry.</seg>

<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu with playlist and select either the processor mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can be turned on enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 obverse option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / ec.xml / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup doesn't need to be short, it will automatically end by opening a different source. however, this would be disastrous at the end-animation, the user can therefore stop the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; IMG = 'indefinite; & lt; / bodyshell; & lt; In the source package of & crmplayer; they are supported by SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing by the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1726">This is always a predetermined backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this was also determined), it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon will return all OGG files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV, it can be configured to used device and TV channels. to this, the scanner can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo (presumably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for the XFree86 server, this will also be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into several elements. Moreover, the subdivision of the document contained in the following elements (part is the most convenient and subconscious element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural view, single elements can be changed and viewed by a single click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [GerÃ ¤teunzip file) was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the appropriate line in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">One DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and is available in addition to PDF the available document of & tex; or & latex; and there are many tools to view, transformation and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the add-on search, the elements of the DVI; file with the Editor is enclosed, and as soon as an element in the DVI / latex; -source code would be clicked. as soon as a section in & latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer is scanned.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with another .tex file. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & Latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is not included in this mode, and there is no calling by & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large-scale selection fields should be explained in the document. the first selection field has been developed for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Other is for the event of articles such as keywords, joints, notes or references. the available motions are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name is created for one section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed designation (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is a selection list with literary entries. at & bibtex; files are necessary only if the file is necessary. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & bibtex; and & kbib; files can be written in & kile; files can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ r is used for defining the font or the main text, the joints, notes, etc., there are the following fonts for the author:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection committees are available: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and feast of settings. 2. the document may be written by reason of hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. the font is not at the beginning, this can also occur in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & Latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of your building or the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compiling. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document must be searched for errors in accordance with errors. when using quick construction & eyepiece; this is not the case, should also be considered the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ 'and\\ end {environment} can be realized.</seg>
<seg id="1781">These changes are only advisable within the environment (from\\ 'to {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there are no damage (number of) changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for extending the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it can be added, for example, certain fonts, fatty pressure, auxiliary pressure, submissions, etc., these commands are either connected with the command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'begin {scale}: this command is suitable for the short pressure and is long as long as long as being closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ stamp {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quotation in the document. the quote starts with\\ 'begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; illustration of the source code, a step-on-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in assistants a bit text was entered, some customizations for the better readability of the document should be accomplished. a few places in the fatty acids and a poem is to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document was viewed, Editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the Editor (with an external viewer) editor. the window must be closed during an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI / file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a simple file format (engl. D e V ice I nº). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers from the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF-converting or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document can be seen (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed on a file (if the printer is properly configured).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar adjusts the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code could be created, the conversion can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The previous search allows the direct jump from the editor to the right position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; binary files. only Modern is to be aligned with Kile settings... tools and equipment can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the pre-search engine, the mouse indicator must be positioned inside a line of the source. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewing takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Using this function in & eyepiece; comes with a click of the medium mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & Latex; -Document from & kile; ready to set and to the corresponding line; as text editor are set to set (attitudes oculars... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using the Quick Installation of the & DVI; Viewer cannot be specified, an error can occur. if an error occurred, this is displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the error source in the source code. in the Editor, the buttons are always used to see the error message. in order to see the incorrect line, the log file must be clicked and kile; jumps to defective row.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the document for the document. the pre-set charges are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing empty document, a document may be written either by reason of rewritten or the assistant to rapid creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¤urous User of & Latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / Latex; file can be created or create a new file. you can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting the document from the document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using a new document, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or string coding). these variables can be set up in attitudes and set up the settings.</seg>

<seg id="1967">The area for the fixing of abbreviations (a type of templates) which can be unlocked in groups, each can be subdivided into groups, each can be subdivided into several & DTEP; s. this means it can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifconfig abbreviation means something else than in one group is valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be managed. plugins are used on the third side, which can be used by any part-capable application, the best-known & konqueror; for inserting a plug-in:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not on a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the Start Plugin, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folders (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "one component in" "" "Just-Lese" "" "mode: check if the plug-in is refused. only-reading files is usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this enabled, then testing & quantaplus; if the entered information is properly, if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, error search has been completely redeveloped. as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead of its, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which allows different implementations using plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The usage of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching debugger plug-ins in the project settings. with the Options Options next to the debugger plug-in selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a project is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables. appears usually in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all support points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, produced, or divided the plug-in with, on debit demands. this action will be triggered by default if a project is opened, so that normally does not have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpiece on debugging session is the session. includes the connection to the debugger or end the harlot according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to include a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger, starting with the execution of the script and the current specified line, when this happens, when the script is done, the execution occurs when performing a debit requirement, the script starts with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger, to begin with the execution of the script, without any information on overloaded variables and the current line number, running the execution. if this is done, the execution will be done, as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes gear-to-error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to transfer the instruction and go to the next one, than there would not be the current.</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & Perptionrc; and also toolbars. briefly, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. tool bar allow for fast insertion tags in a document without risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are not available as folder. they contain only the & Perptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders are named the names of describulation language and version. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML to and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use other users a better look and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only be found in one document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it does not contain only an element type over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; A argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the type type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs to the method. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element can be found only once for any attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed, etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for the attributes in the Tag Editordialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology has within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting tool and methodology. the arguments that can be passed to the method. can be empty or% tagonal name%, this means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that is grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur for a attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Determines the attribute of an tags within a dialog. this day can occur only once in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for each field in dialog box (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Day).</seg>
<seg id="2015">Is there a list of elements that may occur within the possibility of defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Is there a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with an & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and have to be coupled and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but keep up & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaces, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is available in & quantaplus; window windows to start and checked TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check the verification of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following an example of a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file shall be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; transfer function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & Perptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be easily accessed via DTD. this can be processed diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantaneous lus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for every higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set action with settings... to be created. Click on New promotion to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action weighted key shortcuts. with clicking the button user can be assigned a keystone button; with Kone, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detector settings and inserted in execution of this text in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that may change or as input (or parts of the document), are started. they are the quick start-up dialog, or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Even though qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptyou variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptase / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process will be replaced. if required by & quantaplus; this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input of & quantaplus can be determined by default. in the selection field, input can be determined which are to be sent to default. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected documentation is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the output can be redirected. there are two types output: normal edition, written to the default output; error messages which should be specified on the default output, which is set to the default output by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in given case it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explaining. the New Action Knopfes at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use the dialog "Edit" "Edit menu" "", "if available, thus entering the operation possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represents, we will use & kiconedit; use from the & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a button head as a symbol. through the use of green (green, it is mostly interpreted as a symbol) or at least, a message to the user will be signalled that clicking this symbol will add a & lt; - day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still gives you, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Accepted, you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be shared for better overview by some separators in several groups. make sure that the toolbar can be selected automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (very left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that is added to the toolbar, push the arrow to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick possibility to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trenner support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proving of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">In the right folder, save it into the right folder, but your tool bar will be saved, but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder. please fit their tool bar (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the script language or the formatting language that you like one & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository, whether somebody has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; -language. then you will need to create the docrc file. let's make the second part we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files such as php42 / # 1 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1 Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec4.0html Sec2.2 = Sec8.html 2 = 30.2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = day 2 html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # Top level Elements Top Element, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of contents = index.html Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = Socition.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is about subfolder in tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch out & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources should be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The summarizing section is the field of docrc file, which is used to design the context-sensitive help. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file command lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc as simple and as after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and worth are worth to be shared to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by & quantaplus; Community. you will not be rich, but proudly presented to have been working on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources may be sent by email to friends, partners, or anything else. at different places there is an email with email, toolbars, toolbar with email, in context menu from files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all other & quantaplus; users can be checked and only available when our team used it as a correct and user-used for the publication. to sign it a gpg / PGP key, it is guaranteed to use a gpg / PGP key, both for our Team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When loaded, you'll be asked for their private gpg key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can consult a dialog. in dialogue New Resource, the input fields must be completed (URL preview may be empty) and then click OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the DTD DTD DTD (DTEP) menu, the tool bar can also upload files and folders in the template and scripts in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, or before installing, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource may be observed, and it may be broken. please note the warning messages. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, it appears with the indication of the Creator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files could be needed in tagging XML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD-Beschreibung, which shall be used as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name to the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that is on! DOCTYPE day like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; based on converting the & Coolptionrc; editor that can be adjusted with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these fundamental concepts, this chapter is trying to answer to these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. by toolbars, everything is selected, in which shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then stand in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements constitute a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory so that it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are integrated in the folder's folder and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors, the building intentions, the building blocks, with information and toolbars. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document entries, such as close to the current, other or all cartons, skipping or uploading of the document, skip to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorarea related to a further context menu regarding the processed document, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the file under the mouse indicator or open the file, if the string contains a file under the mouse indicator.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors, the toolbars of the editor are present and quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional than standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool bar will be adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert, then click the symbol that the tag represents, then you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert several attributes (like anchors), you can fill different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanviews (QIT;) allow it to navigate to the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to navigate and through. in the display with cardboard accounts for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building intentions are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, upload, or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web site & etc. there are all the options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which, in which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can call the available information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with EMail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on the element, the cursor is set to the element of the element. by right-clicking a element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and claim of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other Baumanviews. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. this is possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development. you can download the documentation section for & quantaplus; the documentation site can create your own documentation, and through adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantaplus; two cartridges at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box covers information about each in Quantum a running script. for example, the DTD uses the current document and all modifications to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the errors in the market up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all the error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. showing the corresponding command. the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-Archive about & kmail; if it's a tool bar, you can secure them in & quantaplus; like every other insecure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. to get a complete list of options that can be passed to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus; you should check whether your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before it bin folders. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>

<seg id="2115">A quick release list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not found on it, with the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use. check in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project-deposit folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insertion from the clipboard, contained special characters to & HTML; notes, so they are correctly displayed and not understood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard to & URL; repair, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. in the first line to insert & URL; s used in the anchors day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button to select button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a row number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script error messages can be found!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Seek a string or regular expression in selected directory. a sort of grep or SED with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Compensation and switching on the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main window will be activated once you switch to structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the icons from the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks using a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with the entries preceding or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents published in the menu, grouped according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">A existing project from Hard Drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for insertion files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched out the project directory for new files that could be there. that enables e.g. graphics files to your project folders or folder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a panel toolbar. these are kept in repository / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you assign them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool bar. allows you to select type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog box to add a new tool. actions you need to specify the name. actions must be saved using the toolbar or you'll be asked if you want to save the toolbar if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. if you don't have saved the tool bar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Thus, you can send their own tool bar to someone (maybe at the & quantaplus; -team, that the toolbar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download an & DTD; you or anybody else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own quality format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh the dusts from the & DTD; it makes sense when the Entities from & DTEP is to renew, without renew the entire & DTEP; if this global and a write permission is not available in the global KDE folder, slipping the loading.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded product range. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is a submenu standard which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or activates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent add means & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar, if this day does not contradict the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above menu points. click on a enabled plug-ins deactivates.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes is dependent on derkate; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-identification. very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; by means of Tidy's external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch may require time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the default card mode, which also complies with the default mode, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open window. with selection of an application the appropriate window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; the window of the window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog can be used every application that use the KHTML part, including & konqueror; -web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behavior of the Editorwindow. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, where you can delete records from toolbars or modify or modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">That should create a help according to the mouse wheel, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and free, but like at any open source project, developers can always support help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explaining and should be completed at the top of the project, as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift; F7 project characteristics can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the repository directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Let this field be empty, the default settings of the selected protocol may be used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files for various projects should be used instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files for various projects should be used instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great, if you want to download and modify the static web content (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to do differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Stimuling, if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are supposed to be mounted. if a project of reason is started, non-aken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good dilution.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select files by hanger or, through removing heads, out-out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project Assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu folder in the sub-window profiles or with the keyboard shortshift; F7 change.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible) to reread in project-related operations like this file folder will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be set in. the Debugger Plugin can be set using the Options button. in addition, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom-window profiles, high-loading profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a building site for every profile, pointing out a own building site for every profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-windows team configuration, project members can be edited, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindows event configuration you can switch off and delete these actions, alter or delete these actions, if a previously defined event occurs, such as the sighting of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantaplus opens; the last project which was opened. this behavior is not currently being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Open Project... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog box will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; the repository will automatically be saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes prior to loading when & quantaplus; Modified files will be done. the same happens if you want a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to the files in the project. there you can manage files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder also behave, however, the entries must be opened and opened with... using the right mouse button in the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded file.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removing the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will end to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept at the core memory and forget the program. this possibility is useful when frequent upload files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the plate save -option not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion from uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many highways profiles can be created and therefore can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or create a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server which should be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this doesn't need to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. you can't use it after your discretion. it cannot be read on the plate, so that it can't be read easily in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simple decent of view, several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu or the project toolbar, accessible via settings of toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting & quantaplus; to make your own operation.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best possible via the toolbar menu. use and adding. the addition of toolbar is treated below in the section Hinds of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be configured either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), which can be set up with New Action, a new tool bar, toolbar, toolbar, or toolbars can be set to be displayed in the dialog where actions may be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries will be removed and displayed action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up the menu with attitudes of toolbars... and setting the settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential document code, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the system existing in the Voronetree link. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you prefer for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions displayed on the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binär is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binaries are inserted in documents using global templates. further information on the template tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents may be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents may be created. normally, a simple rumors can be created in corresponding subfolders. some examples may be found in the previous tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful, if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area must always be inserted into the documents. you can find all examples of a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. see here for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to your desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this happened, notice that (even if it was stored as a project location) the template is not visible in the tree-tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As template. select your selection as local / project location. alternatively, select the selection simply by drag and drop to the building site templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The compilation of binary templates is simple: the file is only able to copy into a pre-deposit folder. you can use all file management functions such as drag and drop or insert on the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder to click on the template and secure a name for template and secure. by default, it is saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very effective pre-oriented approach. you can create headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; create files, add or with them. additionally, you can keep some things while using templates in projects very profound in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder with right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is aborted, once-termost attributes is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This has been activated by default, but if a master folder would be adjusted in principle. if a regular folder would be set so otherwise it would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you can probably find in a family folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a leading or illustrated text for templates in this folder. this could be general head lines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a full presentation using the appropriate headline / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (showing right mouse button) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; and source text editor that are accessible via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: it doesn't load a document like normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and select the source code editor, in which the changes performed in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it's not possible to modify this code editor. it's no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that simultaneously running the changes in the source text editor and in VPL; editor are activated and the Cursor is active in the source text editor and in VPL; this mode is already active that the keyboard pressure is maintained from a window to the others, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization between VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings quantum.... After selecting VPL, you can automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small gap for fast computers and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, this is the editing of invisible tags when working with VPL; editor is also possible, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this will be the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags make the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or remotely. a click into the list allows the change of contents, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key word key.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as possible with the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS-stylistic template by pressing the button button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is like in a text processing, possible due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is behaved as usual. lyrics can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and using button or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way above the tool bar, as described in the source text editor, i.e. an anchor-tag, i.e. an anchor-day, surround with text, must be removed every other ambient air day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bar such as the tables-assistant or the lists-assistant are deactivated. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool to study breastfeeding. in contrast to other programs for breastfeeding is possible, the search for certain elements can be pursued and execution of the breastfeeding system can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To convert & xsldbg; successfully compiled, except & kde; still libraries libxslt, ibexchange and libxml, which are available with a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Hold in a template, at a place in one of xsldbg charged or xml-file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, can be reset and activated later.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had to change many changes and at the same time, another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly could be changed within these lines. and there was no references to the places where perhaps the insertion of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & diff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any number of additional useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work, was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & diff3; almost in a fully-known file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way assembly is fully supported. this is useful when two persons can work independently in one piece of code and changes. the original file (the base) helps dissolve the correct result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; helps you also complete the complete folder and execute the complete folder. this screenshot shows & diff3; when merging the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; shows the exact differences and dendges the possibilities of today colour monitors. if you often have to check any code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible visible. if rows are only visible in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the left on the left side. (no anger, if none changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicate that the file is different. red color means that both files distinguish.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, the Tipple allows you to complete the file name of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual entry of file names, the selection via the file-browser (file...) or selecting a last open file again. open dialog, you need to specify a third file; if you don't have to leave the file for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, you will select a folder, for B and C a folder, then uses & diff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When intersing is checked, the input field is active and can be adjusted, however, it is not necessary to determine instantly a output file. you can also finish this step by saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. you can define options before starting with the same / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes one would not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialog, you can't need to connect the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag an file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar to these functions, it would only be able to upload them to & diff3; then you can simply copy the relevant sections, then add and then compare these relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: you can not extract anything from & diff3; only the text of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and disassembling text into another program as pruning and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such cases, your original data could perish.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any Info-line has a different color. (if the path is too long, then enter the mouse over the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the default color is different. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, only the relevant modifications are displayed only in character strings and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summarizing column from the text, is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line will be shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison chart) also has an Info-line with the inscription [changes] if you have worked the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts are dissolved, saving deactivated!!! (use buttons Jump to next soluble / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be manually replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear. (this will also be seen in the beginning of the group.) This group will be emphasized out with the color background color for current range and on the left there will be a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic assembling or by manual editing, no further line left in the list; it's only a placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps another source. this text is neither released in the final saved file, nor in a mark that you might copy and paste it differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Text & lt; inserting accounts; however, in the clipboard, appear in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. go cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources list, Ignordic C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly to the keyboard and mouse, but you can use the keyboard. if you are using the keyboard, you can use the arrow keys to the right, right, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. this can also be used by clicking on the keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section summarizing and the edit window will be explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture Abward) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all unsoluble conflicts can still be regarded as conflict. therefore, between solving and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is checked, it will always be copied to the clipboard and manually copy it. be careful if you accidentally checked the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX variants are using a row-slide-in characters\, and Win32-based systems use the swap file of the source files, therefore you should use & diff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically when moving and re-made during the next start. (menu entry &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a lettering with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog covers a variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in short letters are displayed. if the selected writing does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be locked. to these systems, the button settings automatically displays an unlocked color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, when pressing the Tabulator button, the corresponding number of spaces inserted. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you enter or press Return, the entering line will automatically be used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, you will automatically copy any selection into the clipboard. manually copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files & crdiff3; first, all complete identical lines can be ignored. only during this first step, white signs can not be ignored. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. however, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car drop-back '\' at the end of a row, other in turn left and kdiff3; the car rear signs will be visible, but they could be deactivated, however, like a white character, however, this option must be deactivated. in default, this option must be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored, however, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated by default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic further skip mode, this setting is how long the result will be displayed before going on the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white characters. if this is necessary as a source, it is useful if white characters are needed in many files, then take advantage of the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scan of folders and through a merge operation. check the details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version, the original version of the suffix .original exists, if already such a backup file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. it does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit & diff3; end and restart the change. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & diff3; it is not available globally via the control centre there.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is checked, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding areas for encoding is a short notice that the local encoding is not changed. (this can not be changed here and for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted by coding for each file, can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding for saving should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may work 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be set with 8-bit ASCII.) By this option, one can define the encoding of the output processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the highlighting of changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. depending on the selection from A & B; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second-secure column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply click the less important window. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2347">Indicate the comparison window by side or overeach other. this can also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. if you are using only two files, this function starts when using only two files. (if this function is used to execute the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be displayed first to this external command. in & diff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that precisely your needs. you can use this function for example to cut distressing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. (see above), then the output of the command is used only when using the command line. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds precisely your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility during setting up the diff results. however, an external program needs to program, and most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that most of the cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED'S /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '. *\\' in the string string refers to the found text in the first clamming. the\\ U converts the found text in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create character strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). the\\\ '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you may start to understand, and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs, which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command of the line ['] / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign of '[' and ']' is a showing, and every one is replaced by nothing, thus quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes, you may be able to perform several stories at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the creation of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED you can also use something different like perl. perl -e -e 's / switch' allergy are required at perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) are needed, perl needs only (and) without the preceding the '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for displaying and to merge. further operations change only the data, which sees the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a regular preprocessor, the Zeilenabt preprocessor uses the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with every function that changes or differences is hidden, you accidentally either notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and assemble complete folders with & diff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a proposal to assemble an object; you can adjust the proposal from the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without it really to accomplish,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... runs selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to compare and merge individual files. you only need to open folders on the command line or the file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder is used as base. if no target folder was specified, & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, not the merge. to select the merge input, you must press the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will inform you a small message window over the current progress. when you cancel the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, displays & diff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder was found during the scan, click here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can click the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or click the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two features all subdirectories and check all subdirectories with which you can check or check all folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click a file, the file will start and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the chosen object. in such a case, the cuddle action can't be automatically chosen. if the association is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries, the colour is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when all of its entire contents are identical. then folders are the same color. in folders, the age is unconsiderably for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow is then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... a and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B doesn't exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not a: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... a, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): error: contradictory file types exist. as long as such flawless objects may exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same datatype (e.g. if a folder and B file is): error: contradictory file types exist. as long as such flawless objects may exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder, and if the option will synchronize directories. then select & diff3; the necessary action is identical, thus both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: assembling and result in both folders. (the user can see the visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after assembling & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the option new file instead of merge (unsafe), then the error message will be different, but the same date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging a file is executed according to the other. it's status column indicates when the merge was successful, and correspondingly other notifications, if something unexpected is completed, you should see a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the setup dialog is chosen, Kdiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the right entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all entries (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified any target folder, then in the three-file merging mode C, B will be used as target and when synchronizing, A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder. there are some options to be skipped through the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To compress all entries: select directory merge / continue to merge in the directory menu or press F7 (the key substitute): select the promotion of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If contradictory file types still exist invalid, there will be a message which indicates the incorrect element. you can then select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you perform all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options, emulating and dismantling.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate When you would like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then guides certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is required (execute a single file), then opens a merge window (note the image screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select another directory merge / continue or press F7. if you don't have saved it, a corresponding dialogue appears. then leads & diff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information. at the conclusion of the list you will notice some error messages which may help you to select the cause of problem. so you have the option to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before running with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were gathered together, & diff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not follow it again. even if the interaction must not be saved or not saved. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">Set the Settings menu from & diff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are shown on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. are several patterns be entered. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *. file must not correspond to that pattern.</seg>

<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidecompression attribute. in other file systems you will select a leading point. this option can choose whether these files are enabled in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>

<seg id="2407">For links to Folder: if the option is switched on, the symbolic links are checked and recursively searches. (note that & diff3; not on possible records), the link will be linked to a check-loop. (note:) This option is disconnected to a check-loop and crushing.) This option is disconnected in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics-columns. (the number solved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they are applied to files which does not contain any text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slow network, it may be faster, only change the change date and the file size. this speed advantage does not cost you. please use caution with caution. this option is disconnected with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changeset date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical when copying the modification date. please use caution with caution. this option is disconnected with caution.</seg>

<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered unsure that the other file could not be changed too.) This option is disconnected in each case.) This option is disconnected.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version will be renamed and the extension .original if an old backup file exists with the .original file, this will not only be installed without further backup. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders merge-view is visible to the merge operation; you can switch the window divider over the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch between the two views via the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double-click. however, in the directory menu, you can merge a single file directly. if you want to merge the folder, the status will not be done again if you want to merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you want to re-read the directory: directory menu: new entry</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>

<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change date. hence the permissions or change of change from the original (please note that option is possible only with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose purpose is currently available as the differences consideration in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences consideration and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it requires & diff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart, the input file contains a patch file in unified format. then switch & diff3; the names of the original files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror click here you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have been changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & diff3; when Part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in the device mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heavier it is available). furthermore, the name KDiff3 has already provided that it may be combined like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be installed in / usr / local, but then KDE may not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if this is not identical, this line will be treated as not identical. if this is not identical, this line will write this way to each other, this includes OFTEN the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor noted for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is needed, however, if the result is simply saved as text file and it's much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort involved has been too big. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to increase large amounts of text, an other editor should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2443">Da & diff3; autoconf and automake is used, you should have problems with compiling. should difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out the clipboard (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and deletes the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position to the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are listed: files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder structure, and therefore not in destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to upgrade the folder to the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder will not be copied to the target folder, if the destination folder will not contain these files, they are missing after the merge.

<seg id="2452">With the central mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; moving within a working area as well as on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends, where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager; it is clicked, the context menu and the name of the application and the entries are minimized, maximize, on desktop and donating. commands the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be used: classically, & kpager; in a 2xn-grid, how made from pager-applications in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical series, which is very well suited for displaying on the desktop on your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can display in size and sliding windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs out outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right button of the mouse within & kpager; and subsequent selecting switching switches... can be set up the dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this hasn't changed the dialog for Settings - but you can manually do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or VI.

<seg id="2483">In the default settings & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a moveable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can provide a selected set area in the magnifying window (selection mode) or the environment of the mouse wheel at the screen edge (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse indicator in enlarged window, select the click of mouse pointing. please note that & kmag; currently not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse wheel. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse indicator.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointing window and hold the left mouse button, so you can catch the contents of the magnifying window and move it into the arrow keys.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool, emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same place. it is thought to help people suffering from the RSI Syndrome (Repetitive-Injury syndrome) and for which every mouse click pains pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool, emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse pointing a while. it is intended to help people who use pain within the Repetitive strain (RSI). Moreover, it can emulate pain with your mouse. however, it does not require a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& mousousetool, can handle the pain, which is created when clicking the mouse, helping people to use pain without pain. unfortunately, suffer from the blows of your computer. unfortunately, you should consult a physician, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & crmousetool can avoid pain, which arise when clicking on the mouse, it is useless against pain that is caused by moving the mouse, useless. and, as with all ergonomic assistance, the result can vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & mousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click if you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shiver activates, makes & mousetool, a break after pressing the mouse button. in this way, you can run the pulling when pressing the mouse button. the smart shift requires a little exercise but you're thinking about it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time, after the end of the mouse movement, before & crmousetool, has to hide a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is Intelligent Variables enabled, the fillet shift time (1 / 10 s) is set. here the time is set to let the mouse button wait, before it opens the mouse button when it is not possible because of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click through mouse shift. this function is activated, followed by a break, a click with right mouse button. this movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can slay & kde; to do so, see Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there's a Slider Sound-buffer, which you can reduce to a lower value in order to reduce your response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other windows environments, please click here to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the user after the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should first be switched off. if you then click the automatic mouse click here, you can later alter the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times by & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should consciously make a mouse click without effect, clicking on the neutral constituents of windows or on the browser window that doesn't want link to unwanted reactions. you can park your mouse on such places until you would like to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is stacked, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty easy. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse balls, but also the rolls that come with the mouse button in contact.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must take out the mouse balls. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the trick and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & crmousetool, when it's just a shift process. if you're using the intelligent shift, this means that & cmousetool should not be able to finish the operation by the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & crmousetool, using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is in fact that you can perform a mouse click here. this is reset by the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & crmousetool, continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor over the cursor where you want to have it. you can use the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop if you want to create a keyboard-click here; the grey areas around the toolbars are encased; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the title line of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I tried to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you can move. it's very probably possible to move it into the clipboard or to insert any other action, where you will probably get problems with pressed mouse button. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shift, if you just start to use & mousetool. select the text instead of the text area, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text, and hold the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click here if & crmousetool; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & mousousetool, the XTest extension has to be installed and should be installed on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a speakers and these properly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, provided the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing short. this program was designed for people who suffer at RSI Syndrome and to whom the sufferers of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool, can also be configured that a certain time is waiting to let a pulling process begins before releasing the mouse button. in this way, the drag-up process can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktops; for normal working with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed, before it is sent to the program of speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation, to select incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, or to deal with certain defects of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktops; different types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen reaars has the highest priority. it will be drawn up to all other orders and does not keep these orders. if the output of the screen Reader is read, the obtained orders will be back again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is going to get hot. a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and plain text. these contracts will continue after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message is breaking normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application that uses news. during you & eg; you can welcome a long text on a web page, you can enter into space. & kde; notifications are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order which you used by card ticket orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text entries. text entries are thought for the output longer texts that have no particular gingness.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. when applying the output of a Screen readers, while & ktops; just such a pre-read, will hold this issue and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readern. they are applied to normal warnings, news and text orders and on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and put it on the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replacing parts of a text by other text. the resulting parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions, which allow creation of chat emotional sensations like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; into a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transducers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language, Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery & ktops; some XSLT files are contained in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With intercom selections, you can depend on the content of the text or depend on the program, which sent the text on & ktops; if you have set a female voice, you can read text by KDE-news about it. read more about the text.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules, according to which it is defined for voice-overs. if the filter does not apply, does not affect the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; alert on & ktops; sent them through all activated filters, which have been set up at the bottom in the list below.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown below for the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison. these samples are exchanged in the text, then the text is exchanged against the appropriate replacement.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filters. you can choose your name any number, it needs to distinguish itself only from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter resembles the text with the strings in the column and replace it with the string from column. the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the latest list or delete a list from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language entered, the filter is only applied when the speaker is used for text order one of the languages listed here. you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the & Ctrl; button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered, the filter is only applied when the text is used by one of the specified applications. you can set multiple programs separated by Commata. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID run-out programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. & DBus; -numbers must leave you away. if for example & qdbus; the application ID head-3432 can only be entered.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string filters will then be applied to the text when all conditions associated with an entry in the box. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the strings filter is regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. words must be limited to both sides by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc can be reached.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the optional speaker selection, you can send text to a specific spokesman, which is set on the box map speaker, or to a speaker with specific properties. you can specify that texts by kmail from one female voice should be read.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; a text on the filter is looking for a narration for the text. the speaker is selected using the narration properties, which provides the text to & ktops; sends, and the characteristics of the user card speakers selected, you can overwrite the selected narration.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place the characteristics of your desired guide. if the text meets the above-indicated filter conditions, the speaker is selected, which corresponds to the desired requirements. Click on the button to indicate the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or delete your intercom settings or erase all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including the package kdelibs and the development files for the program "tool-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source lyrics of & ktops; from the source context for kdepp or have downloaded the program currently being installed, you install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you are using & ktops; check first if using speech-dispatcher with your language synthesizer correctly. you can use the shell script file-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; that is how the program of speech dispatcher is used so that the setup of multi-dispatcher is directly possible and the SPD-conf script is no longer required.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and set boundless filters (SDB filter). SBDs must start text in single sets, as only the first sentence must be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you may not jump, or cancel or cancel my text, even if the voice synthesis are not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the boundless detection filter. at the first start of & ktops; you can change its settings or add other proposition character filters, but beginners will not be used.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest way, you will learn how to check the intercom selection. switch on the map selection, select a few features and check back how the selection of the microphone has changed. to this, you will have to have set more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then quicker by reading, as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You are then able to stop or cancel text orders, even if the language synchronized this function is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal movement limiting filter is automatically set when you start kttsmgr into the first time. it cannot be removed, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satan recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of propositional and paste a tabular sign (decimalcode 8) to the set limits automatically from the lyrics. note that the standard movement limitates the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; -News (kgs), warnings, messages or the output of screen readern.</seg>

<seg id="2771">For these voices, you have to compile an additional module, therefore you need the source code from the festival. the German voices are subject to limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice puts a festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early development stage. unpack the software in festival / lib / Voices / Russian /. if you enter the Russian voices, you have to set a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. look at the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian, or Czech language, the encoding line must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter;, which allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called through the selection of K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, such as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installing a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knuworkconf;) can be launched by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & cronworkconf can't install any device hardware. physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured, thus & knetworkconf; the device is at all and enables the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing & Linux; installed and installed network devices later, the drivers must be loaded according to the kernel version, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is automatically loaded if the network settings in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module's network settings, this is automatically recognisable to detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the suspended selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the Distribution and Releasement. by selecting the setting non-once-requests, the setting of the network settings will then be set to be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Modifying the network setting is possible only in system management mode. before, all the options are gray, meaning, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can only be viewed by clicking the button management mode at the lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the management mode the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The installed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface... in the dialog device can be arranged.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the button displays the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection, the TCP / IP settings will be collected from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information will be provided with any system startup, therefore no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP address must be provided. in the input field, the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">This setting is marked, initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values set in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the tool box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not used in the network. the input of an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the address is already used. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. switch on one switched network device via selection from the list and click interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. switch off an activated network device through selection from the list and click interface....</seg>

<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support is replaced by the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if computers may only use IP addresses, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the horse name resolution allows simple management of this list. entries can be added, removes or modified. DNS entries can be made up or downgrading in the list with buttons or downgrading in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button to add... from the group calculator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added. the new name will be added by the New Nameserver.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be carried out one of the following tasks, then with clicking on OK the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. just download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knit workconf; the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all by & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is provided in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 never has large distribution. IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation is the network administrator the response station, which can be used by a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can't be selected as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing a own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses can be used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are located in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is required for IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as an enclosed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as defined there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Sukosconfig. another stand is expected to occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a sighting program for tape drives based on tar. the development of & soldier, with two objectives. the second goal was to create a surface for tar, which introduced my wife: how much longer will it take if you secures it?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be supported by & dat; this can occur in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; trains the band and reads the stressing information of the tape. recognise & dat; the band doesn't ask, you'll be asked if the band will be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the prehunter, search for the appropriate index on your disk. can't be found, you'll be asked if the band index is newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, changes the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the band was integrated. in the status bar it can be searched for the band by pressing the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before expiry of the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to evaluate this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives an amendment to the band for the band that integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before being used by a band of & dat, it must be formatted by & dat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A belt types must be formatted before you have to use the formatting at & dat; this procedure does not comply with formatting at & dat; it does not affect formatting the tape before use. floppy tape drives are typically required to formatting the tape before using DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity is driving & dat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost automatically! after completing the formatting process, the band is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the insured files. that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a secure profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a bunch. only the so-marked files and / or folder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of backup process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives created for the drive. it is only checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bunch. only the marked files and / or folder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">With the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has started, the dialog for review. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the work folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for review, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before installing the recovery, the files that should be restored, can be selected, can be selected in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive. only the selected file or folder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files from one of the archives created with a bunch. only the so-marked files and / or folder are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu to restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog for Recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the job folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for the restoration, the dialog appears to restore the progress of recovery and data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the tape-indexable using the Bandinhaltes. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index over two kinds of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a secure profile with the straight selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should be made. the list of the insured files will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that can only be saved on the same filesystem, such as the folders. file that can be stored on other file systems, can be saved separately under backup files. each entry is considered independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been used since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will only be secured that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The file name, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Tar sails the snapshot file before calling tar which all files are secured and a new snapshot file is used for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of preparation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... In the Settings menu, you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path doesn't have to point to the non-winding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & dat; before the tape is mounted, it is necessary to load before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">This option is switched on, tries & dat; the discharge of tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when the integration of & dat, the tape is switched on. use this option not on Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tried & dat; the hardcopy block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must notify & dat; in any case the blocksize for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & dat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only be a memory block on the band. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is your name: seconds, whereby the name of the system is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which have passed since the epoch, where the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band-ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives created directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are non-incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer can not know where you can get information about your system or where you can obtain information about your system or where the system enables you to access the various protocol files; experienced users the quick access to information about problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of protocol files of the own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can not know where you deposited information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows for quick access to information on problems related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some extended functions, using the protocol-files of certain programs and can be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a range of useful functions. among other things, include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following displays, & ksystemlog files; functions are available, with their help you can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol. if you don't appear, and it opens up to a small message window. the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the / var / log file for the normal user or do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter on a selected criterion or according to set string. in default, select a protocol line next to the selected filter. then, a protocol line will be displayed next to the selected filter. then, a protocol line will only be displayed, if in one of the columns contain the string search string.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point of course. select the column process that is displayed in the protocol file system log into the column process, and then apply it into the filter strip on the name of a process, thus shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol-rows sent and compiled by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a clear color as protocol-lines of step note. setup dialog can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you would like to show a certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or on cron protocol), so you can find the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific instruction as for example to start the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can navigate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you find further information on the reference sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; in addition, please find in the following folders of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & quot; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V init editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init develops quickly to the standard control system when running the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible is the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't continue to go on historical aspects (e.g., because I don't know anything about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to change a machine on System V init, without having a new installation and new formatting. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains all full scripts. basically you need a script for any system service which you want to start at the start of the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; System services include not such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not have this file, even if it is actually not much use it. you can also wish to execute a rc.serial n / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first which he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is written in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably will notice that the pre-established runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair something, then proceed to the system by restoring the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how to start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no right files are located. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that it accepts a argument as startup and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it's a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to establish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; also, I could also have a user-run level, & quot; & kdm;, Network & etc;</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say trivial: simply drag an entry in the section of Available System Services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop too).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. this is not only done when they draw an entry in the area of Available System Services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved, if you choose to select this into a new runlevel, you have explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu and add them to the target range - even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries which have been cast into the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the various working ranges (Available System Services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous step.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the names of a single entry, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog button to accept the changes or press Esc to disclose the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of loss of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysv). otherwise, they are saved by & ksysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should be normally in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services in these distributions, simplified the configuration for proprietary entry programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check whether all configuration files are required (and also if they are stored in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without message if its configuration files are not available or incorrectly arranged.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; run-level varies from distribution to distribution, even if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & users; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & user; reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save it. either use the appropriate symbol of toolbar or entry Save in the file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user groups. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings, you can create customized settings, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd will be installed in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password password is appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card box appears only if for at least a registered file system space restriction (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user parameter, whereby the limited number of information is available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field system file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card map groups informs about the group height differences of the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by forming them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialogue features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select addition from the menu user or group or click the matching adding button in the tool bar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group will work analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO System Manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to booting the standard operation system, remove, change operating systems, change, change, change and more.</seg>
