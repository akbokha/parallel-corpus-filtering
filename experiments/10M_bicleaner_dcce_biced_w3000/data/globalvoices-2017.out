although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American music is read , American authors read and run its sports .
in fact , this country had pro@@ found@@ ly pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who discovered the top German con@@ spi@@ racy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who wanted to occup@@ y his interest with judges that wanted to occup@@ y his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; me was it if the absolute truth is , forget all others , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are , and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I had even written a very dirty love letter above his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me as he moves with its narrow face .
he never stops behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he th@@ inks , like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statement and tuned for him in Don@@ ars .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number one ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support this big@@ u@@ ary person , asked me ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his v@@ oters in line with people that I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from around the world , a deep glorious human being , with whom I managed to talk about Islam and its past .
however , Tr@@ umps are not backed by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; translated .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours so that &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; play at the game .
tr@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity of gener@@ osity , which I experienced by Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gling with the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
still fits them to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues , to pamp@@ er us the complexity of the American life .
then there were still Andrew d@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors that helped me much in my career .
these people and those given by them em@@ bodied my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump led his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they found me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
however , it emerged , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the argument with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either over rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ lay these things almost the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump @-@ v@@ oters as r@@ ust .
to sort the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these v@@ oters , of which most white are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to re@@ win control over a country that it has disappointed ?
in other words , they didn &apos;t want to say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who puts the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different as he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ ol@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( D@@ Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White against all other Eth@@ n@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as much as Sch@@ en@@ der@@ trau@@ ma , as much as Sch@@ ra@@ der@@ trau@@ ma , what exactly does the Great Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; did exactly what America did so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - whether my@@ th or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always like , America is always welcome .
for this country has chosen as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ er , whose history , how he himself says , anywhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a giant large part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with mani@@ fold , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ru@@ d@@ der , say they .
at all that I think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan must think the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd .
&quot; do you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they rie@@ ve them and their voices were pure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone who doesn &apos;t have such a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no more space in this new USA .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of Cat@@ e@@ ura in common ?
that music , played in both places , does not only change the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ gro@@ omed ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing with children and adults of the symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome them in the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and ban@@ den violence .
yet this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project , and the youth so a rare hop@@ el@@ age .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI believes :
as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the bu@@ cket day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Waste
more than 7.000 km south of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - on instruments which are manufactured from recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the Recyc@@ ler started to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all were made out of waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local artist teacher and music teacher at Cat@@ e@@ ura &apos;s children at the beginning of time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had no place to contact the parents in the litter . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them don &apos;t live with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra , which plays on instruments from recovered material and called The Recyc@@ led Orchestra .
a documentary N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) exc@@ els the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and live by him are the ones - as humans are in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of Content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already been operated in Liber@@ ian waters of illegal fishing catch before it looked to the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were brought so accordingly and little gen@@ ei@@ ves to welcome a criminal act of this way to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mozambique and Seych@@ elles are rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to raise one of its har@@ bours and ref@@ uses to travel to him a fishing licence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that their simply refuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds of Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at a time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was removed out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch some fish .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative was to cross the criminal practices and protects the resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar as prime minister had exp@@ elled their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are in@@ con@@ ges@@ tions and work together . they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : which is caught , hidden because it is extremely difficult to split , is the illegal fishing industry is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain hab@@ itats and species may be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem damage , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once suffered by bureauc@@ ratic hur@@ dles , and also by Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange different lists of existing lic@@ ences , news for susp@@ icious activities or details which had to be noticed or experienced during an dock inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if these move on open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark ships that fishing in banned areas - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its around fish to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly , whether they have a criminal .
countries , which are against illegal fishing rods , can be denied by assum@@ ption of such ships in their ports , meaning that the ships cannot sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to count the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing catch is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is what we want to achieve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
closed Front
the platform has been created , to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , representing the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing species that attract the area of commercial fish catch from around the world . among these also ev@@ il@@ ar illegal fishermen .
among other practices include actions , such as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake lic@@ en@@ papers , speci@@ fying imagination protected species , fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and use the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You will not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole try to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations .
it has been un@@ covered criminal networks that had counter@@ feit banknotes in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it volati@@ le ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , helps to split the illegal Shi@@ ps to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , where@@ with they can &apos;t be taken out of satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help criminal vessels with greater precision .
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana . it offers a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world &apos;s position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assem@@ ble with neighbours to get a better picture of which what does it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and serve their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has led a similar project , where a global system provides the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not merely en@@ crimin@@ als , but also scre@@ aming .
ships that explo@@ ited previously without license and hardly to calculate with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i accounted for a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , ever since fishing boats can buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to split Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice that successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that other countries have become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study project , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With Security , the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent Member States reported his first big triumph : in October it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without licence and have been banned by tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also prohibited in prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign against Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh &apos;s illegal fishing catch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative work is actually working in the whole world .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government of Venezuela on a referendum on a referendum , the Veneti@@ ans responded to the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , where they met on the roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political and economic crisis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others , in the flat @-@ area of Bar@@ inas , in the central regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is deterior@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Veneti@@ ans by acute deficiency of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance to rev@@ ise the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the re@@ taining of a re @-@ election was blo@@ cked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of government regulation in the following article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate and Ge@@ wal@@ tr@@ ate belong to the highest in all over the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which the only way to give the country to conquer the country &apos;s institutional structures and conclu@@ de its institutional structures .

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mart@@ yrs , which are published in real time , bear an overwhelming participation in people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen , as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the prot@@ ect@@ ations : &quot; will you kill me because I have hungry ? &quot;

on Twitter are images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of op@@ pression and mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
especially great waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the Police and Armed Conflic@@ ts of the Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hours later they could not leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to hold police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not bear skirts , because otherwise we could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic makes the round that marks the level of op@@ pression per day :
thus the dictatorship collap@@ sed .
many representatives of the government had given the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure in question - this has now demonstrated in the eyes of many of countless people on the road .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
now , as an adult male , Qui@@ j@@ ano , in the framework of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
he started to bear the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family sec@@ rec@@ y .
in the situation then I thought that was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child , 15 years ago , one cannot remember that man is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , the terer and the rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ur@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 @-@ 1983 , a period of state capitalism , his father was deputy commander of the secret division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors that was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had wit@@ nessed the extent of the atro@@ cities in the course of years , and that he had promised before a federal court against his own father .
its story shows what great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose for itself a way of redemption .
from the Sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me a military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I got myself with a young boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all they called &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP .
pass only if they lead you not one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Per@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for example , my father had moved .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University locks , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ When dr@@ ens the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he told me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket , I ordered me to wear it . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were ab@@ orted and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he clari@@ fied on an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I j@@ ump@@ ed in , and saw a rec@@ umbent , tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that it was fixed at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was cap@@ tivated there .
they put on a bed with a towel to bed , shot him with water , and gave him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the stri@@ fe put down there was terrible ... like a dirty p@@ addle .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room .
I knew the smell immediately and me was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never could forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do a lot of suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father participated in the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand @-@ kn@@ u@@ ties and were bound .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , an civilians , which was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses which lay down naked women with the face at the bottom - all were bound in hands and feet .
in the proximity of the included people quiet@@ ly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me anything else ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know that because my father told you home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms have been designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defeated a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survi@@ vors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of death in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was sentenced to death in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture of the chambers .
the path , which you come in here , is also the way , on which the run here came here .
if you look at the map , you see that it was about that way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got assigned as part of the process of de@@ formation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above mentioned they should be moved .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things by home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - how it was called it .
but when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps Military Inf@@ antry , who fought a enemy that has fought a enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , record players , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ lt , then this is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I &apos;ve always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to stop into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , who handle cars on the road ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried , saying ,
when you go , then I will find you , and I will be able to stand you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
that was my father .
I have no one good memories of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then I bore a jacket and a rolling pul@@ lover from wool . both of them had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
then , at that time , the defense accused me to have compassion on this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay me to load what they wanted .
I was anyway , so to send out .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the bodies is the last ab@@ h@@ aun@@ t A@@ kt &apos;
now , where I &apos;m older , I &apos;m re@@ gre@@ t .
I have children . if you only have children , one can recognize the value of a life .
one further develops and acknowled@@ ges that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , so you did ex@@ hil@@ ari@@ zed during the dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ?
why do children do ?
one day , my father brought a girl with his mother &apos;s house , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that a little girl was .
I ever asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have just put them into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families , to whom they could be transferred to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ able act which one can deal with a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took the machines to eliminate mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , showing my father , was created during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him acc@@ us@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt strange and asked myself , for the whole @-@ driven patri@@ o@@ tism , and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which allegedly defended it , actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed hor@@ ri@@ ble crimes and you have forced me as a child , to participate in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I ask me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first display .
I finally knew that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can disc@@ lose me that I am pre@@ occupied with my own father .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish magn@@ itude of the judgment .
four years ago , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process celebrated crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Tribunal sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases of arrest between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there was hands .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .

all def@@ endants were , during the dictatorship , members of the military , including former military , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 , and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations that have worked for years on Justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country on which La Per@@ la was erected there to be a memorial that is now headed by human rights organizations .

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving licence .
this photo was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
works of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving licence during the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; due to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but maybe also with the same hin@@ ge thanks to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read on electronic ads from 1st to 20th September in the input area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been divided into social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ oto . it was also that the local time to take attention to the local time .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult@@ ation for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ law@@ ed English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for translation errors , explained that the error was already contained in the text which they had been tested by the translator and that translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told about the exc@@ use :
&quot; it is sorry , that older people have ins@@ ult@@ ed by the in@@ sufficient correction ( translation ) for ours , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News has somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older car driver in Japan &quot; and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was stopped as in@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents , but definitely for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
thus , her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents during the same period .
the name @-@ mentioned rep@@ orter brought the article published in the Yahoo announced version of this article , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this a real car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so bad is the translation really not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not find that a real transmission error is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in whole Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true place of mine for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to survive , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in native language , in general the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lators should not be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English to French into English - not from French to English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be attributed to lack of understanding for over@@ taking , cost reasons or relatively small number of English native language developers , the Japanese language .
some companies who have no foreign employees can have translations , however , the Japanese employees , whose Engl@@ ish@@ ness is best , - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
the translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ sel@@ y sets , which are created by mach@@ ined translations , show that this technique may not yet replace human trans@@ lators . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also frequently use T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for silent reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but of big companies or by the government who have means to guarantee higher standards , can be more careful translations .
the city of K@@ YO@@ TO uses a serious source of translations into the future .
Venezuela : turn Prot@@ ests and Telecommunic@@ ations on the Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Fre@@ ies Surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users had no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet dis@@ appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels also contributed images of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ positions , the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is to be coupled to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ elan provider may be closed again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Veneti@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of troub@@ les .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 by the reporting on protests . then , the Commission for Telecommunic@@ ations reveal them with pur@@ ging and lo@@ ckers if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission would continue as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two more online broad@@ caster . this also applies to the Internet site , to which the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
earlier research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers may benefit DNS . this is a technique that def@@ en@@ act the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blo@@ cked by the DNS , the server answers or refuse the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ am@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who captured the protests in Caracas live .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was held in police hospital .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported to regul@@ ate Internet connections : this will continue to move the Veneti@@ ans access to multi@@ media coverage through the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls are becoming sc@@ ler@@ av@@ ens to obtain an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now they visited the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fight for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were precisely how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by curator who will be published by Global Vo@@ ices by courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying c@@ ows , drop@@ ping schools &quot; ) published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not work together with the family that lived there .
shortly before she studies at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
those who has become something , said , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one described more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money survived their min@@ der@@ ous son or her min@@ der@@ son &apos;s daughter to another , enrich@@ er family . in exchange the child will receive food , education and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , however , that the children must do countless days of home@@ work , which will never be paid , and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised in part of a contract .
this practice , known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and many other complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged .
she tried to give things to name , because the feeling of gr@@ atitude , which is vacc@@ inated to Cri@@ ad@@ itas .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a family that her daughter is in faith , that they will make their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something out of himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be translated to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with itself and jus@@ ti@@ fies the faith with faith , that she would not receive a chance that would not have been an apprentic@@ eship and maybe even star@@ ved .
the sacrifice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will find only many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has set a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military court Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the resident department .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira broke out as long as a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they in@@ sist@@ ed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society in the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest protest together and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; would be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photographs were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more c@@ ows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an immediate study of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is come before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as workers , they live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ b@@ k worked in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father had lost his work .
their brothers had to go all now and began to sell on the road or on the market conf@@ ection@@ ery to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of its employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in doing so , they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn .
it was on each morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and the ground .
when the school was finished , she went back home and had time to learn .
ever more they had finished with learning , the more leisure had them .
but this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , they never had to hunger , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the household as food from the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in force during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to some evenings by the Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a household in addition to him and from opposition positions like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media concerning the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that said , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had their education , which she had made , would lose them again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was however completely clear that they had got for everything they had got from them with their hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in school . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone , who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone to stay at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , during the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to none group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the society cheaper the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can share a job site for cleaning staff and nur@@ ser@@ y in Paraguay .
the Administ@@ rat@@ ory of the Group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a Municipal Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please ask you .
beginning from Monday , when possible .
the advertisement got five &quot; L@@ ikes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ ty @-@ year girl and gave their telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered its 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
a third review was written by &quot; a girl from the country of the country that wants to work . &quot;
then the author switched off once again :
Dear friends , I &apos;ve found one . I look at it if it works with it .
thank you , I &apos;m writing again when something is .
the business was completed .

draft bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register at the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary committees have recently agreed a bill to &quot; regulatory regulation on the use of use and practical social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt to a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which thereby has contrac@@ ted , citizens and citizens able to use social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , user users should have to register their right names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it be missed , this could not be a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a money bu@@ ck .
the bill , which consists of six paragraphs , is defined in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running over the Internet and to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
it is unc@@ le@@ ar , as the law is put through it , as the draft should not imp@@ ose the user &apos;s rights and users who do not make account of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary majority and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the Al @-@ Monitor , registered user experience and user received a user name from the telecommunications department , blo@@ cked by the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to access their identity for Egyptians and Egyptians , to access the network .
but it is not known so far , that such plans are made .
experts and experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Technology is ( in German &quot; Senior Research Institute &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; Global Vo@@ ices :
I desp@@ air strongly on the technical capacities and the understanding of the neither authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that it was just as they would like to control physical public and private spaces . it also could be online .
if I take it seriously , then means that they will establish a powerful monitoring system to apply citizens , which does not apply a permit or not . and this means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and as@@ sign it to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft should initially be discussed at the parliamentary elections and the constitutional committees before it goes into the debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement are successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose sens@@ es shall be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legislation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those provided to be found guilty of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the Tier@@ protective H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the Leop@@ ards family that strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leopard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Man@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are threatened by Wil@@ der@@ ei , losing the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they are always less prey .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; is the Persian , the only remaining smo@@ kers in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the memory of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on it , that a large Rau@@ b@@ tier is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leopard really in the wild mountains is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video it shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as trained biolog@@ ist Raz@@ a shows passionate about other side of their country , which consists not only war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and education programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , established for the Nor@@ theast of Japan , had been affected by the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; Thir@@ ty Cat@@ astrophe , &quot; a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , in Japan &apos;s pre@@ fecture , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had an atomic accident , already alone around 160 000 inhabitants left their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows out of local view that progress has reached six years thereafter to re@@ build the life of local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ building authority as well as survey results of the person concerned .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( including the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) pre@@ fecture , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate , were finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i took place , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima operates with 70 percent the final .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated two years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ u ( &apos; , cas@@ et@@ su @-@ ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were transformed into defini@@ tive spare parts .
after the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el accommodations .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such courses .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodations , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in emergency accommodations . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were placed after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ works have been planted in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , this figure is 34 percent here .
status of working and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the mis@@ fortune , which opens up to nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial renovation in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fish@@ eries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation once again , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ports have resum@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and atomic accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land have been huge .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farmers in Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be used .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a consequence of atom@@ izer , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmer by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the &quot; nuclear weapon &quot; zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has largely re@@ covering again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away again .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their lives .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a whole image , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she in@@ quired about the state of re@@ building and how you changed emp@@ ire towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population in experience .
the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken hold on future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents have not yet been done enough for cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has increased its attention to the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic erup@@ tion , atomic mis@@ if to experience Japan .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement .
after the end of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ ic areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees are still more than 50 years old . they are able to compete with massive construction projects , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are involved in construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet people from other countries that speak another language , the differences appear to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while , one knows that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to re@@ mind our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s take exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that earn less attention than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment in which they have felt very closely linked to anyone about language and country boundaries .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ y talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love to live in common language skills throughout the world , where she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after having been assembled by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had taken him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide took millions of demonstr@@ ators to a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and then moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers are to reco@@ gn@@ ise , who was identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident was announced by the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of active service .
the pictures show the police officers , such as he hits in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke to the face of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ators and would be on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and thereby jus@@ ti@@ fies the entire supp@@ ression .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ kt@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video in the net , where you can see how Mat@@ eus attacked and become several San@@ itary shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , which lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during which he is located in the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father was assassin@@ ated , and here , the military police force of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group was assassin@@ ated , and now we have been attacked by a polic@@ emen who had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who has been defeated by a stroke .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it happened on Friday &apos;s brutal police operations last Friday .
polic@@ emen trained in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber floors and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as .
member of the F@@ la@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media road protests are dist@@ orted by focusing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo has reported specifically about a broken glass windows to illustr@@ ate their title pages illustr@@ ative .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred one title story with a set @-@ down bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve to report a special thing .
this must also be identified when it is stri@@ pped against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police are dec@@ eived by the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included the doors of almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , is located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , un@@ aware that there is no significant sugar @-@ harv@@ esting spot on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were installed in the sugar cane factories .
after exploring the sugar cane industry in the region , the sugar cane industry remained silent , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ le of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some variety the work .
other aut@@ ographed and comm@@ ences a day to the factories , which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , which opens every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry isn &apos;t rough his sleep .
he heard that it works in the east of the sugar cane factories which are back in operation after a long period of time , because they were preserved .
that was something , what he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls itself exactly that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ effici@@ encies , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount .
the message would have been a motive for the land before some decades , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway line of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and barely competitive they were not competitive for the country .
initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the strain crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased again approximately one decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar is between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Per@@ spectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go down with security in history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the down@@ fall of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same was in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich am 14th May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez served in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is talking about the closing of the factory , the word that he is repeated , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ d@@ ents are the same mind : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive this place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first running year , the first letters started to come .
it was officially collected around the official documents , which would only be found in terms of the parts that would be removed from the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were increasingly frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money insured for the sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the end of the factory at the end of the factory , when construc@@ ting it helped .
each part , which he removed , dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most import@@ antly developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work bench has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services rendered in the communities , where they were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw , as he guaranteed , for those who had no longer run in operation since five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar@@ cane is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the parish church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better than they started to un@@ cover them , they also list@@ ened to asphalt road , these dis@@ advant@@ aged , also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to request other factories .
they were share to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields the old soldiers to spend a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not conc@@ lusive person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him , not .
they have been consuming it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into R@@ ente for 65 years , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is forbidden .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
you@@ ths from the First Nations communities across Canada are focusing on topics that are important for them . they do they do with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour we bring mobile audio studio direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were headed by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec , with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop thus increases that young participation in conversations themes such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , con@@ frontation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of Tr@@ änen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen were missing Indian young women missing or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to conv@@ ey how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs , despite its influences through glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always have to rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a st@@ anza in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel myself , nobody ever would ever be interested in me
but I tried to continue my days on the earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will charge one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead to our youth .
so they can do that which defines the Creator for ?

in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a large number of these small businesses that produce plastic dishes in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in his film Tokyo G@@ a over 20 years ago .
most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usual that they don &apos;t even need them anymore . a new trend , however , is transformed today in show@@ y cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes , decorated cell bands , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed to kit@@ esur@@ fing collection , as in this case , refriger@@ ated rank@@ ings :
here are some sho@@ cks refriger@@ ated rank@@ ings for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essay is becoming increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travelling dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a cell phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an Apple , which contains your mobile phone :
designed to view like a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing start into the community .
some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon are used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their dou@@ b@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can consume my mobile phone with sal@@ mon che@@ ating ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes may also assume any less appeti@@ zing form to surprise your colleagues or family members .
our latest cell phone support has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand bands from dried sal@@ mon .

&quot; for the victims of fighting against drugs . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffic@@ king &quot; in Mexico , the missing and gear@@ ed regularly occurs only in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy , which brings together this struggle .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ mán , the b@@ oss of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Cart@@ ells , ur@@ ged the stories of the conflict of conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone looks at the g@@ rief or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bodies , behind every bone fund in the hundreds are married tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose w@@ ounds will probably never cure .
therefore , the Mexican news portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico has created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( german : &quot; with the drug traffic@@ king , &quot; ) that this victims should give up a voice and tell stories of people who put in the struggle between law en@@ forcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organic Crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and leave all the churches to get a little as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear is life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tell exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is searching for every weekend &apos;s secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez that lost their father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task , which we have asked to get rid of and to the graves , according to the people that we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who also is with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my Father , but not paying them out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; explain the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t just show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community , conflicts , frag@@ ility and citizenship .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a bookmark by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Guer@@ r@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that violence should never consider as normal , no matter what form it appears :
I have been known illness and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now for some years now .
I come back to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling that I am the only one that is imp@@ aired or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or considered normal .
she writes further :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin think when he is large , and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; Lab@@ ours &quot; of criminal off@@ ences when they go through the streets .
for me , it is that , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who fear him also something .
I see our weakness , if stories are to mere numbers in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbour can be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raised &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they &apos;re talking to say that they may be spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and quiet@@ ly .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : &quot; as a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed for month money from their business , until they did not only destroy the business but also their family apart .
you think about everything you have lost , and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes beyond that trau@@ ma remains , fear is up again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its has changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
we continue our each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you .
I asked myself in this terrible days , whether we@@ eping my deep@@ ened feelings would arise , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to live . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells you that he had to teach himself like an egg , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas warm and &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ ein - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a young woman who had to come from violence and learning to live thereby .
when he was five years old , man told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloo@@ dy bodies of his father had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city of the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor dropped 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who cannot be forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ als , whose goal is to include the complex information behind the failed fighting against drug traffic@@ king , which contains the country in the past four decades , in understanding of the country .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; of Flick@@ r users Nik@@ las Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages , which he linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment where it comes to raise a rum@@ or or del@@ etion .
but how is the years after the first time emerged ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first publication it has been mis@@ leading , supporting trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - do not den@@ y the fact that it gives pl@@ enti@@ ful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a petrol trol@@ ley crossed the place S@@ ange on the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was ne@@ gl@@ ected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous paths of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank @-@ car dropped to the victim .
administrative representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as in the proximity that was filled with people who clearly depic@@ ted the World Cup .
houses comp@@ assed and conc@@ ave cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes that day .
up is an example of this .
it shows rows of conc@@ ave body which rises up on the ground while looking for people .
but here the story finds its end .
over the years the same photo was seen several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but unfortunately , in the context of the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the met@@ al@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and glu@@ ed in roads and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody remained back to count dead , &quot; said to human rights Watch .
many were cr@@ ushed , shot or burned .
only on satellite images the follow @-@ up could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the armies left in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the picture from the DR Congo was back on , as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
actually , this ab@@ stain@@ ed use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ chie@@ fs ; Africa &apos;s Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was introduced as proof of mass surveys .
yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the image from S@@ ange appeared in connection with the deadly pursu@@ it of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee ra@@ pe , ra@@ pe and certain deaths , some of them are burning .
while others reported on violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab News page , which claimed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an has said , mon@@ ks and politicians have used to participate in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to imag@@ ined these information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 may be accessed here .
other news organisations , AFP , as their source called , had also attributed to this statement , but didn &apos;t have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this wrong cou@@ plings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
using a &quot; reverse @-@ looking images &quot; you can see how far more information can be higher .
an converted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to that of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture mask private parties , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed incorrec@@ t reports , others have tried to lar@@ v@@ ise the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have implemented examples of mis@@ use and they have been associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . this way , we want to display the operating range than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples of mis@@ sil@@ ly use can be combined from the below countries listed in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be completely divided ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ations of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ based countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available for examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or counter@@ f@@ aults .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to met@@ adata and information , which are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica cited as his source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known if the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have seen quite clear sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that contra@@ dict this .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as proof for the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of un@@ miss@@ able use of the image from the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et from the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the attempt of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tra@@ cked to del@@ ig@@ i@@ tim@@ ize , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the Myanmar government published a direction to discuss it as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed messages and photographs , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to abol@@ ish mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
this direction , which appeared exclusively in English , also contains references to counter@@ feit images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech could sl@@ ay and be used by extrem@@ ist groups ( which is often circ@@ ulated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ Х@@ р@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ р@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ б@@ н@@ е@@ с@@ к@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ б@@ н@@ е@@ е ... &quot; ( Christian@@ op@@ ho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , who addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the DR Congo &apos;s picture shows that Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein has been involved in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the cath@@ olic near News page , An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not of the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it had a &quot; similar d@@ st attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeping ) .
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion on Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the stop of Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ed as proof of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were combined with no religious context were taken out .
instead , the goal was to set attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Malt@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message he was report@@ edly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , it translated discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ se@@ ate .
from the message , which included the picture from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner missionaries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further examples of incorrec@@ t use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye has also made , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time stamp ) exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and must have image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original score of 2010 , the image is ultimately a correct description but the original entry is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( ind@@ entations ) that passes these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about silence in the context of Christians by Muslims or for the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life can be evaluated by a European or French life .
Religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to investigate as pictures in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can &apos;t give this pictures longer than belief .
with social media there are dirty people who have un@@ inten@@ tional to exercise the water around a tragedy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sug@@ ger@@ ates this mood of false - and false information that the true atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it tastes like what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread violent pictures has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al equ@@ ates to reco@@ gn@@ ise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern , that non@@ fiction pictures and spectators will take advantage of emp@@ athy and to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , those subjects such as for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while some more non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media is the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technolog@@ ists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they will thoroughly think about the situation , in which a picture can be derived from the context or in completely ab@@ stain@@ ed way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any examination of false grants should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons are used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ disp@@ ensable ) tries to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ cep@@ an ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brakes ) .
but all resist st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , so why a full explanation and sometimes require some context necessary to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u language as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Check you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ sr@@ rik language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about :
they grin@@ d other cultures , reveal other commem@@ oration and aw@@ aken our curi@@ osity .
sometimes , how we can analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to show more of these &quot; unnecessary &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to download their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is circum@@ cised with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island nation Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and earth cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ sun , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya occurred in 15 districts in the south and west of the country about the shore .
after a statement of the disaster relief from Sri Lanka , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missed due to the floods and slu@@ dge .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were gradually returned on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water distances went back slowly .
health and hygiene requirements of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos provide an impression of the extent of the fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka . deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kan k@@ ills the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ves crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was standing in the flood , water up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also floo@@ ded the water level of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five aircraft for rescue activities and further five are made for transport of emergency supplies in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also been prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood @-@ situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and li@@ f@@ ists are required for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and li@@ fel@@ ong goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if you need to use animals in this area .
the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f app pickup Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app to inform the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Trop@@ ic Ro@@ an@@ u cat@@ astrophe , pick@@ Me carried out a &quot; high water remedy &quot; button , which allowed the users to pick up a vehicle to pick up support of assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to our Red Cross .
likewise , they conducted an &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousand qu@@ eries and 150 successful bo@@ iling campaigns for a result of floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding people .
the agreed efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , bring residents in need in security and aff@@ ord assist@@ ants .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality .
Muslims who can &apos;t see
the Women &apos;s March , 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib Gh@@ azi .
using approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and loving friend .
I trust my four year old daughter , when she tru@@ sts her children , she is my rock in the bran@@ ding .
in one minute we will call par@@ oles for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ el@@ ding we are rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of rain sh@@ ielding and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ ers par@@ oles vs. anti @-@ hos@@ tility .
my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me and say , &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people , with whom I work , or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who has built them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which has built up in its introduction .
they cul@@ tiv@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim but on different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims who do not clean@@ se there , be musc@@ led .
to be dra@@ fted
I do not ste@@ er alone .
that is even the poet , whose poetry is not sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come in the sense when you th@@ inks about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I &apos;m now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er mus@@ li@@ fied Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western performance the religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the induc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , Western books have been colonial for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man whom they should fear , and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid was laid up in the 1970s the history behind these pictures .
but these pictures even rise up today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still ste@@ ady them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ rati@@ cally domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ adows reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States couldn &apos;t have to choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recognize that if French and Muslim women are prevented , their head cloth in public buildings to wear and sau@@ di @-@ Arabic , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which both are two sides of the same medal .
a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ vely weak@@ ens Muslim women to conduct movements for change .
in addition , it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective st@@ resses of such deep and faul@@ ty , that often Sik@@ h men and children are to target tim@@ us@@ al attacks and sh@@ ik@@ ings .
because of these stories , we tell us , and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
the workforce of 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , who can help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rati@@ fication of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of religious group in America in the highest degree .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my parents came to New York to live in their American dream .
my mother met her first jewellery design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan had re@@ invented the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were innocent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ignor@@ ant Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes , if I ask people , why am I not a pi@@ g of pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , kill all Muslims at themselves - &quot; of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t wear all pick@@ pocket or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to fight widespread lies above Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated anti @-@ hos@@ tility , think tanks and experts for counter@@ feit information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of it , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories , we tell us , and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ hos@@ tility consists in more than just a stranger , which has under@@ lined the head cloth .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

it is access@@ ing our identity so far , so versatile and complex that it can fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born , but when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social schol@@ ar described religious life , they access the following terms : faith , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my musc@@ ular faith and behavi@@ ors are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would look my gir@@ l@@ friend , my rock in bran@@ ding that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 metres of concrete and air that our houses can separate .
she would see the evening R@@ itual with my daughter , if I remove them in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the coral , which are defeated by the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I pray you , that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and to the evil one can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an ic@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal grand@@ mother , including her sisters , how they win a competition to the art of the flower business in Kar@@ achi .
it &apos;s the picture of you that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and incomplete paintings of Su@@ fi @-@ Hol@@ liger ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that they can be near .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to speak the prayers , which she said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be as it exists , as they brought me to relate to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people that - over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um , &quot; which was established through a &quot; emp@@ ire , &quot; which established a company with the name of hon@@ our@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time , my assigned grandfather .
Inter@@ im , while he writes books about the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan also wept sore against his family in India . he did not close to his arms in a half century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn , like in my grandfather , from col@@ oni@@ alist , which have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been colon@@ ised by four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history of a century was rejected by a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , fasc@@ ist subject of British imperialism , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before it was air@@ crafts , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion you will go back into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ sealed history .
it means that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent , apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction , which do not exist .
it means that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim is to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ates under veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that if a tragedy , the USA is secret , and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times more reported as a history with a white attack .
it means that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was created by a fre@@ ed black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call a American hero .
it is the heat that I feel , as people crow@@ ded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hope that I feel for our dreams , and when we &apos;re talking black life . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion appears more possibilities than a magic cubes , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are represented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to make me care of my child and make all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ ison@@ ous and privileged people built on this branch of structural anti @-@ hos@@ tility .
structural anti @-@ hos@@ tility consists in the Muslim regist@@ rants , which began with President Obama and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration , who takes up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just countries , which bom@@ bs it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely decre@@ ases Arab@@ s and Muslims .
they are the wars that we lead and bom@@ bs that we throw in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell us , and because of those who don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ real image and bes@@ ought them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation that we must lead
we are deeply dar@@ kened to ab@@ ili@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades to reco@@ gn@@ ise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous manifest@@ ations which we ste@@ ady in our news editors .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our much con@@ junc@@ tiv@@ ate identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Muslims ; Zap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ rade Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to re@@ produce Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned with this difficult global time point , in which we are located .
and this moment have consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet now , lead to the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by being created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago it had not been given it ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history that I was not aware of which I was old as I was old , but that now I have made my daughter today to an un@@ disp@@ uted Muslims .
things I left here like a bread @-@ rum@@ oured track in my speech .
things , perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ c@@ tions that makes our humanity , may make a story lau@@ gh , where someone is made to another &quot; rest . &quot;
right now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation within the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic hos@@ tility took place .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts , with whom we usually throw in our schools or read our articles in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; others &quot; in public presentation , four decades of science at Stan@@ ford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show ourselves un@@ comfortable questions , as well as my gir@@ l@@ friend , and I have no pre@@ ten@@ ding to present the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as my gir@@ l@@ friend , in which we have no pre@@ sidents who are already broken up countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have already been bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants urban language diversity
story tell by Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone else ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and sp@@ it the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not admitted to the children there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we do cities to accept the diversity - safe rooms in which residents do not forget to include them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during listening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understand these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list@@ ens to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language and translate them in English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ o@@ tion and their representation will result in that the audience is set up .
they call laugh@@ ing and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the country &apos;s typical customs of art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork from the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the importance of his f@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ let , he shares his feeling of the inclusive :
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project , can join T@@ LS in touch to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ als .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ en@@ forcement of state debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public deb@@ ts of Puerto Rico , on April 3 , 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started the capital building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the ne@@ ural testing of the debt ) and the National Assembly of Puerto R@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the re@@ en@@ forcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os demands that politicians , bro@@ kers and government authorities , responsible for the deb@@ ts are responsible for their corruption .
we demand a financial examination and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests to the public deb@@ ts , with a firm , our working conditions , which is acting in favour of the economy .
we will be sque@@ e@@ zed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of State .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside are likely to run without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens , from among the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ cally @-@ Palestinian WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has performed for an open net .
this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that will be align@@ ed in Berlin , devoted an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ ühl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ e excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective re@@ research ) .
the book , which was released last year and released here , contains a series of attachments that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how moves for Fre@@ ies knowledge , and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have participated in the movements of Fre@@ ies knowledge have side to page to see over the fog , who gives out our news@@ feeds and create something to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ que Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was d@@ ashed out of the A@@ dra prison directory where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal lives and in freedom .
as Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us let us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given in this process of extreme belie@@ fs ?
the WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a Gh@@ azi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ le had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly be@@ heim &quot; by the military tribunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
Gh@@ azi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who set itself as in@@ sidi@@ ary of the Assad government and set them by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a crucial role in the Internet and to know access to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technolog@@ ist and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which established bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes was more fore@@ seen as the work which he began with a group of arch@@ ae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything that architecture , not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strip into digital arch@@ ae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule created for the public , as well as schol@@ ars and artists in the future of in@@ valuable .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ tia could not un@@ lock this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a Gh@@ azi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spent my whole life with this , of freedom to dream , and b@@ ays taught me to emb@@ race them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel was translated with me in English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read and speak English well . I learned to speak and speak .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .

Mozambique : convicted of convicted and convicted of corruption because of corruption in corruption
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption of corruption , returned by a government member after half his sentence to the workplace in the State apparatus where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 with four other def@@ endants .
the money was bor@@ dered by public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was named between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guided tour and immediately requested his res@@ etting into the company , which was then on 19th April .
in accordance with the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who claimed the application , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , where the company had no discipline after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the center for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CIP ) , an local institution which sets itself for public transparency , den@@ o@@ unced the decision of the company , the Director of the Company , the Director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the CIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we think is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contra@@ dict dispute .
however , the company though apparently advis@@ ing appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambique social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considered &quot; resist@@ ed &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would have been advis@@ er after he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment .
he could hold lectures and mo@@ tivating speech , he could advise and his image stops .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has v@@ elled to re@@ integrate it into the company , which he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza would like to be paid for his silence .
not contra@@ dic@@ ulous !
Bit@@ on Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza re@@ wards the state because he can &apos;t believe him , I can &apos;t believe anyone who has been rewarded with such a way that the state has already been mas@@ sively bel@@ ated .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but himself only served on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , in order to get a in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man has become tired , the pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t pre@@ fers to re@@ mind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to re@@ mind that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mos@@ ambique &apos;s prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , cutting and - next to that - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous ren@@ al represent@@ ations was , when he was vig@@ orous , &quot; an ambitious human being able to sell his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that the tac@@ tics will change , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from its ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious human being criminal . &quot;
reactions were also accepted in Twitter :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years old and escaped .

Facebook blo@@ cked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to un@@ righteousness
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; signi@@ fies ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ age .

according to the Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from net , because they contained the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; .
although about the origin of the word still is discussed , it is normally used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook is cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; them &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ ischer script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hass@@ unci@@ ation in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely valuable conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight Hass@@ unci@@ ation in Myanmar , the company has licensed a lot of sen@@ su@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word that doesn &apos;t call itself automatically Hass@@ le .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or dou@@ b@@ ts for his use , have been cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ o words with basic various mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters like &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; cal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cham@@ el@@ bow ) , &apos; cal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) or &apos; cal@@ arc@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they could cry out how he could reli@@ eving his back pain by drawing a word .
the movement ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - res@@ embles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that she will decrease native language radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ise that fac@@ ebook can be analy@@ tic , before it g@@ lowing all the Po@@ sts dissolved in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead , is carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( switch verses ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ est language , receive quite good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise its nation@@ alism .
while the action shows a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ le may spread , the efficiency of this strategy is not long .
the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of percussion is often a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative notation of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his podium as he just wanted to communicate his friends , that the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook , I made a post to communicate my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and share of contents for 24 hours is prohibited because the Post &quot; does not escape the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their views on the hate &apos;s radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
Post@@ al without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the post , the author distributed its opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community should ask advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words be cen@@ sored only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems that as if they started doing this without local context or technical support , and so words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; In@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have banned .
even when they found out that they did not make mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would have a great revenues , would be the great .
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has cat@@ ered for a lot of spi@@ racy under the users .
instead of taking serious , users now have fun and write the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ le to see if their podium will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language , but nevertheless removed :

in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , social networks have been used to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ unci@@ ation in social networks will also have to pre@@ heat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been responsible for his failure that sh@@ ouldn &apos;t speak against his bur@@ mes@@ o pages under control , cri@@ tici@@ zed .
but instead of simply sh@@ aving the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look more on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the children &apos;s departure
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s departure is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanimously a law which aims to prohib@@ it this practice so that the married couple now is 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage , some members were Hin@@ doo and musc@@ ular religious denom@@ inations in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , who had gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state will not be mixed , since that , age does not constitute the maturity . &quot;
this was un@@ aware of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors of the United States , for every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by 2.8 percent , and 18 percent were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the State &apos;s statistical office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were gr@@ asp@@ ed to abol@@ ish the laws , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . without doubt , they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the Cri@@ tics of the Children &apos;s Before , they should not take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was un@@ complicated for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some@@ time would happen if the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all .
however , in early 2017 , the bill of law had decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that could be discussed , so that it could be discussed in the representative office , where a simple majority would take it to the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the President of the country must agree , and proc@@ laim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the broadcast@@ ers of the country gave Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle released again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill of children was approved in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not only one of them .
after being previously approved in the Senate , the draft plan can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws have finally been changed to children &apos;s before .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary od@@ ede that has the nu@@ cle@@ us of the thing , but know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it took definitely long enough to abol@@ ishing the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , said : , , Excellent News !
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for them - 0 against it ! ! ! !
Fol@@ der Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civilian group that was quite openly talking about the adoption of the law , noted :
the married couple in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independent of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ sche was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were united against the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s departure is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago not allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ age@@ - child@@ min@@ ds .
many thanks to all activists who have created him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ itary Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , and he seems to be emp@@ tied to his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris , Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said that Mah@@ ar@@ aj was contrary to the law , most social media users would des@@ irable the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell smote before :
Dear Sat , when we , instead of discuss@@ ing the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we may want to talk about the state , that they may testify to the state in our bedroom , that they may be un@@ used by major , hard @-@ represented men , which would be used against them , would you be ready to communicate the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a court violation of law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there is still locations on the world where children &apos;s ab@@ outs are legal , or still the norm is , although there are laws that they under@@ go .

for over a month , Turkey un@@ locked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ yc@@ lo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day for day is more clearly how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series defend against the lock .
although many technicians of Internet users are used , use power tools for blo@@ cked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey does not fall the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in this category ) .

according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror@@ sides ( pages , which are reflected in Wikipedia and are often updated ) .

this can help users to view at least any Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org self .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .

S@@ agar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were disappeared with bad@@ ly positioned mo@@ tives and well @-@ balanced colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to try the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ agar to bring to the international scene to S@@ agar .
and his home place right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos the attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described Facebook to help him this first @-@ class location during his work :
I live at the border of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I rested just at home , when me suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately started to k@@ g@@ ging images ! !
S@@ agar stands for collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to understand understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like .
and he should know it , because he was face to face from face to face :
a tiger can not be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of sheep not when sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
even I was there because of darkness in the way home , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ he@@ ks appeared immediately , and we look forward to seeing me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ agar places &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until it took a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodations .

years after the marriage took Indian women for the first time , to speak the name of their hus@@ bands

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ fo@@ a , and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women with greatest care should avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
instead , they use a pris@@ m or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect for women &apos;s husband , as well as fear of consequences , they should consider the norm .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to death from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a through a pseud@@ o court and attacked by their family and the village community , having addressed a married relationship with names .
the tradition also doesn &apos;t have their wives to name , is also distributed among men . however , they have far more far @-@ right assign@@ ments . however , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ lo@@ im in P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus rapidly become the main themes of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , to discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and is committed to disman@@ t@@ ling the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the association of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made it simultaneously for the change of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in her discussion round , did women who call their hus@@ bands to call their hus@@ bands .
it has op@@ ted for this topic because she wanted to open the interview about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
the names of their hus@@ bands are not to speak lou@@ dly , a brilli@@ antly , whom they have not guilty and have never been ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman is resp@@ ected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this is considered extinct , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made up to this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never had called her husband before , tried to try out at home , as soon as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ mother @-@ mother and my husband still weigh as long after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned aside to me , and said , I will call it by now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ ini Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate , &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good cause , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us how they might call us , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in whom they brought the name of her husband to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ ast of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise , it was only c@@ lon@@ ed ; another decided to allow all the sum@@ p@@ ation of fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family , taking him cur@@ sed .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ st@@ atically .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ausch , with an ancient spectac@@ le , the women decided to actually try to call her hus@@ bands in their name .
and they counted their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman proclaimed Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put to women in the head : his wife did not cease to stop his name .
another club member chose to do it with dinner in front of the whole family .
she wa@@ ited for her mother @-@ in @-@ law , and she was afraid , and said that there was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying of the car@@ cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the marriage :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the interest no@@ ber@@ red dot if it also works .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to wear it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely heard it , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the discussion of discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we are making a trip in each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure that women could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months she celebrated their own birth@@ days in her life her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and talked about things that they had never made thoughts before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for many years now and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est@@ ly spoken .
it feels great that certain things can say lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have enter@@ tained about the concept of glory and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a large shirt over a p@@ ants ; they have not been married .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the benefits of its own clothes @-@ selection , mor@@ ality connected with sar@@ is and much more , sch@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini had her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they now have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
on the question , if in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into rolls :
so we have only made small steps .
some women tested it a few times , but then heard it again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear in any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ l for more freedom of movement or its own dress @-@ election - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , you will consci@@ ously sit in the same boot .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us every one of us that will change anything .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman is living in the club and others , what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Holdings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! this today is the Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration day in Japan . in the past 51 years it was in Tokyo .

the Kit@@ sch &apos;s Kit@@ sch survived everything .
today Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration is day .
we all love in our house the Beat@@ les .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should present or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you must visit .

2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )

at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been revealed and a part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and in the consequence they stood , that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there may be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a gl@@ amor@@ ous man &apos;s gold can bring forth gold or wealth , the Poli@@ ze@@ winner of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the purpose of path@@ ologies for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , people are infected with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country a mission led to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .

in recent days , three men were murdered with hair@@ y problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers / Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , the clear@@ ed that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , to which Mozambique is opposite :
I would like to ask E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , DAS S@@ ICH , a country where men would like to call for good notes , work and other services , a nation in which the people would like to buy good notes , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or belie@@ ver for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be ch@@ ased to reach their wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomena , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ t humor were not taken away .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has gained attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced late June that he was delivered to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ing ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker says he didn &apos;t need it to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to get calls from the international community , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , po@@ ets Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ iz@@ ers or to him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely retired .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some responses from abroad .
United Nations
hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June , Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ z &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into store after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , though the Norwegian government told that this would have nothing to do with decision .
diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to return the sal@@ mon to China because the exports have been blo@@ cked since 2010 .
after the news has dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill that Li@@ u was able to pick up his hope for an unconditional release to expression and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was not able to opposite his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow attention to seek medical support , where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China for the release of Li@@ us , as in a statement on 30 June :
we expect at the same time that China lifts up all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they all want to meet and receive all the visits that they wish , and to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans wish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , unless it be helpful in his gen@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message requested the Chinese authorities to liber@@ ate the Chinese authorities , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection of US embassy with@@ drew from China to itself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to incorpor@@ ate itself and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the married couple :
protection and freedom such as travel and access to medical care of its election , which they have made according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international comm@@ it@@ ments .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz introduced a decision on the Congress to push the Chinese government to push back the Chinese government , Li@@ u and his wife unconditional .
I ask China to imp@@ ose the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o unconditional , that it can be in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin , that Li@@ u gets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the 7th and 8th July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in the Beijing News Agency , that China had great concerns , whether the host of the host could survive the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for an appropriate medical care to provide an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to move from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP , that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police have always allowed the room in the hospital , and that there is no smoking not allowed to contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further tells us :
Canada calls for China to protect his international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , maintaining the rights of these rights intervention .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry demanded China in an explanation on June 29 , on the Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he needs , regardless where , his wife and his family can have contact to him .
although the news broad@@ casts France Info already reported that the French government was welcome by Li@@ u in the country , announced that there will be no further information , whether France will be able to receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the Central Committee in Taiwan demanded China on June 27 on , Li@@ u fre@@ iz@@ ers and a larger tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ l@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u called by the ruling Democratic Party to allow China to allow intellec@@ tually intellec@@ tu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very wor@@ ried in a statement on June 28 about Li@@ u and asked that many of him have asked to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that he had received and had been strictly pun@@ ished for a more peaceful , stabili@@ ze and prosper@@ ous China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which again had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and stat@@ eh@@ ood in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem to appear , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as the city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of an meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked if New York be a democracy ...
this is , although most people are getting a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a town .
we are no country .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Justice of Justice , &quot; to turn logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and dedication to create this valuable country , we hear that we have no country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the shine of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am was not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared un@@ satisfactory .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the main point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian action of power , which will return demo@@ cr@@ ats , leave the dist@@ orted logic when it adap@@ ts better to its power .
in the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s last week , answers to his American guests in regards to our press , our Judi@@ cial System , our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions : he with non @-@ replies r@@ ational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clari@@ fy his opinion , since they did not understand these conclusion .
personally , I find a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be gr@@ ate@@ ful when our wer@@ der K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he wrote concerning the critic@@ isms that it should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to Singapore &apos;s statements and no country .
read the script .
when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; to be a country , &quot; he declared how the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward free and just elections .
he received Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was no country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t think it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment via Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I didn &apos;t know Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected to do with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ b@@ ts and I am not even sure that he is really associated , associated and conscious of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak@@ nesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s arguments :
has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; cred@@ ited a mistake or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher speaker ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , in which country go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Inter@@ governmental Register , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ an increase their military service , they defend her city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the years of exile , Singapore is always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many Singap@@ ore@@ ers to be off@@ ended ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a town / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear about &quot; the defense of the country , especially , &quot; but this is not quite true .
we should talk about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect at your residence or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world should be revealed and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 and again in Japan .
depending on the situation which takes place in the situation , it is also a pol@@ ite , interest in his discussion partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication will then follow the default answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook , perhaps in@@ fir@@ ing before W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans but does not distur@@ b me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little , which distinguishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag good at her ruck@@ sack when travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
it was also already when I began to travel through the world for 20 years - prior to Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Can@@ adi@@ ans always have small map@@ le leaves for their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a free healthcare !
there is no weapons with us !
equal marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say &quot; exc@@ use &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is report@@ edly considered the toler@@ ant country of ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I wonderful .
nothing would amount to me if you would be conf@@ used with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
fir@@ stly : as &quot; cute &quot; means to be known as well as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &apos; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian bi@@ kers ) .
if Canada was really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; kind &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing but one can encounter with it .
harm@@ less , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and in@@ interesting and not deser@@ ve attention .
this may be a good thing if you want to stay in the background , far from the things that happen around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire is free and alone to be a head@@ quarter of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs to us .
what the above are &quot; nice , &quot; it might just be cool , just cool .
Canadian do not talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we l@@ acks warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au then became the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video which rel@@ ates the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , who ruled the power and re@@ produce the civil government despite its promises in 2014 .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Ph@@ a@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him that makes him his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video rel@@ ates in@@ directly to the prolonged military service of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook has been divided into Facebook with 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 L@@ ikes .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; was blo@@ cked in Thailand , after a group of activists called the public to view this video .
one can interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as well as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues , which Thailand have been har@@ assed over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which is the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the He@@ eres total decision making important national themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people , who are considered as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer de@@ crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and unc@@ le@@ ar regulations are often used by the authorities to hide activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army which monitored online content and people who accused the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand sets a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup d &quot; coup .
one of the problems , which the Jun@@ ta continues to buy expensive U @-@ boats , despite security experts they were warning that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste from tax gel@@ ato .
in the video , even as people are tos@@ sed in a black delivery car , before one brings them into an inter@@ ni@@ est camp , another problem fall .
some journalists are sitting in the prison because they report@@ edly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and have been imp@@ lic@@ ated for long adh@@ esion to the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser &apos;s members of the band , which was launched by Sal@@ ut , &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; had already been used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and appears with friendly permission .
the post@@ war company re@@ covers only very slowly in East Asian countries , especially in the T@@ spher@@ ical district .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ spher@@ ical al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Hydro@@ log@@ gia of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , sh@@ ank , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live the biggest of Rus@@ sians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called spirit cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10.000 people , today there are only few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ spher@@ ical al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the Great War &quot;
the empty @-@ story resi@@ den@@ ds of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ovina are called , symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met with an native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to end this to end .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is nevertheless a unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with forbidden Pra@@ cht buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where it is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately draw back immediately .
&quot; our mother is forbidden to us that we let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something , and suddenly , they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of domestic products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the rounds .
the District Administration supplies candles in winter free of candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman was named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ os , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ Asia in order to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and in@@ sist@@ ed that she instead supports its young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly install@@ ments are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither one vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive . &quot;
t@@ ante G@@ unt tells you that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is engaged in his own issues . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ aun@@ t to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; one can get spo@@ iled to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ in Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she remin@@ is@@ cent of the village life before the war .
despite the relations , which live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative center in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take something else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage ru@@ b .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once again , they kept pigs , c@@ ows , par@@ aly@@ ne and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
it tells you that it was a very fri@@ gh@@ tening situation when many people left the village .
but in the course of time they lost their anxiety .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get spo@@ iled to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
indeed it has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war , there was hardly any job , and all lived like them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day like the city and the war once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation is inclined towards the end , a little boy went over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball is flying from the window and another boy after him .
he plays with the ball , which rolls out the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ ing the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who ensure imm@@ ac@@ uation in their lives .
they don &apos;t know otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts &quot; Mig@@ rants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 at the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I attended one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican female , a small woman with a cor@@ r@@ als pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather them ) became a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 2,50 Dollar the night can sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of afri@@ can and h@@ ai@@ ti@@ anic migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people will come in full small buses and the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s more quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of them slept even outside on map .
she wants to re@@ ject any@@ body .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys their medication that they can not pay , they mas@@ h them out of the long trip ex@@ haus@@ tive feet .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him to ask if Mama Africa was a reasonable top name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has had a yo@@ ghurt ) Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it really fits , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to meet her husband and the three children there .
they lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are going to move in the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other drivers from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ kaner speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers at the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship .
when the Brazilian economy has we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
it has been a guest at Mama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he would have contact in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will always remain in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests will send their often text messages when they continue to gr@@ asp@@ ing or report her over the course of their journey .
they declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
don &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a blind al@@ ley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar a night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking site outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what to do the guests .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there three years , he became a raid on his office from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels by Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ one , has offered their roof .
a few months later the family lives still , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the courses they consult the passengers calm their phone .
today , a small coach has arrived and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of them that go away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she fl@@ aked in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ eing that her made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old men .
she laughs sad , while she pre@@ set them in short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya &apos;@@ Et@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are already continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants will be forced to install on their mobile phones a surveillance app .
a check @-@ out for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , have the use .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to receive access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also use the app to use more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and distribution of the terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telecom .
the main function is the blocking of the no@@ graphic web pages , from online fr@@ aud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users to make sure how much time they spend and control their own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used naturally in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker capable to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is often very often ble@@ ak for those who live in remote , afflicted ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often sort extreme c@@ ens@@ ings and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ y Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was published by Check@@ point in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point in the polic@@ emen who sel@@ ects the residents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had installed the supervision app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you be discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest of the rest technology .
we are back to Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; End@@ estate China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can raise the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gains un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic towel .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town council , to minim@@ ize the dissemin@@ ation of illegal contents .
all government agencies , authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when operating their computer and communication instruments .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible prizes , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after Death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and set hard that you &apos;re on one place alone in which all is important .
everything has dis@@ b@@ anded and finally dissolved and a truth reveals clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that did not feel in a list of feelings and supp@@ ress who do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you stop the reality , and look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the actors - transform the characters from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death .
all dou@@ b@@ ts arise in smoke , and you shall re@@ mind you of your existence , even if the Earth is caught on the axis of the infinite . it is clear that you have built between the walls , and you have built your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that &apos;s not enough to put my lesson like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the security service it formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he set his power against us by taking even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five yo@@ ungst@@ ers were torn during a peaceful protest , such as accidents from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to grin@@ d the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schre@@ ia .
all the neighborhood sought to cov@@ eted all neighbour@@ hoods , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even if I put no high demands on a city that is to be stri@@ pped to the arter@@ ies with state security and their ac@@ complic@@ es .
in the third night , things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence when I cried several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice by the silence contra@@ dic@@ ted .
few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we are forbidden to a splendid picture that filled my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment we are aware that you have free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the barley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey is down , nothing can give you back your voice , after you have made it all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear me , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are just bra@@ ve enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes looked forward to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really urn what to look at me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was my thing as surely as I said , &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to watch them in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and I don &apos;t know any word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is like his father . &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed proposition is me up to now in the nose .
he was sentenced to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a Muslim torture , which I was exposed to months .
I sh@@ ou@@ ted the farm .
I leave everything in the first office I carry everything with me .
afterwards again by the farm and in the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I &apos;m looking forward to me all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise , otherwise , they gave me another cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must share them with only one another prisoner , and let me go immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , the officials left the cell , and I left the cell , and I attacked on an ancient communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade himself was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ akening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he answered me .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells , there was a resp@@ ected man of middle ages that looks like and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in complete darkness , no mark@@ ers can be seen in me , and doctors are not available here ; we are all the numbers .
&quot; maybe someone who sounds like my voice like my sounds ? &quot;
all responses to one of its existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sured me , they would happ@@ end to stay if I remain .
li@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird &apos;s dream to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ eling at the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
I &apos;m still listening to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that Schwarz saw the color of understanding , until I set the yellow light , that provided us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rec@@ ei@@ ving on 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to h@@ ears . &quot;
this was the secret behind us to protect the state safety against us and prevent the tra@@ itor and terror@@ ists in us , speaking in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ inations and locked the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the crime of their c@@ lans into a her@@ oes .
I enter the audi@@ ble room and come into Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender , and st@@ ash@@ ore man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions of the facial expressions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can join this day and prot@@ ru@@ de on demonstrations that will soon be a close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to me , not to answer .
I can really don &apos;t tell any more , when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication technique .
when and as it happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to pamp@@ er myself , though I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls his loving &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker testi@@ fi@@ eth at your cry .
give him pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t stop your cry .
my cry fell not enough for him , why they inter@@ changeable the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables in each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one single hour , three of them are dis@@ continued , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , why I stopped to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling and found no pleasure in any order , so it came next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , which was out@@ stretched onto the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
the door opens and the morning meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , ar@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make himself terrible wor@@ r@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent , and walk away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoking a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text , recorded .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of its time inside ; sometimes he v@@ ets to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what can be fors@@ aken , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or with nic@@ otine ad@@ fast@@ ing lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ ib@@ s family came to flee to their village in Palestine , where she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , who was transferred to the conservative majority of mutual opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ Music .
with his music , which deals often with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ aring , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find relev@@ ance in its hom@@ etown Am@@ man relev@@ ance , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limitations in his thinking , and he can carry out according to their own testimony which suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though it is not open , he will get a special ascent against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes not that his sympath@@ y for those who try to do in war zones anything , if he was born in Jordan , even if he was born in Jordan , and never before being in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life of life , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then , he adds : &quot; I think that I am a man , &quot; while he was cr@@ ushed into the water @-@ sol@@ uble nest @-@ caf@@ e in two cups . it is the Holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little with protest against Islam .
basically , the fl@@ avo@@ red coffee and the vibr@@ ates of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is primarily associated with freedom .
sometimes Jordan did feel like a prison in free sky , especially when one th@@ rows a glance into neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to do basic things to do - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to do not in prison .
recently , the interior ministry of Jordan did a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committees , which support the Islamic State Front - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ er Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country contra@@ dic@@ ts and the main reason for the concert statement should be said .
the members and former press spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; Just &quot; had been canc@@ eled because of sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which constitutes the ancient legi@@ tim@@ acy of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a describes the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that continues to use an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement may be probably not simply stup@@ id rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an increasingly clear reality in Jordan contra@@ sts that occurs in H@@ da@@ ib@@ s plant clear .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b used traditional gender standards , having formed his vision of fate from the fate of Arab women that have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown wife , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust .
over the past few years in Jordan has increased the number of &quot; hon@@ ors &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to human rights , Human Rights Watch therefore reached its cul@@ mination in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still lacking that Jordan was missing an institutional infrastructure to help protect women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on frag@@ ile fighting in 1954 , women cannot be det@@ ained at in@@ defin@@ ite time in prison , &quot; and for their liberation , there is often a long @-@ term bureauc@@ ratic expend@@ it@@ ures , as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will nothing happen .
also H@@ da@@ ib@@ s music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , even prior to topics , that g@@ athers in his country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ y that his work is politically , however , that he &apos;s his music that &apos;s full of exp@@ ul@@ sions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , is not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me was rich@@ ed politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically maintained in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a way , in which one can get , &quot; that &apos;s what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ Belie@@ ve , hetero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that no one speaks to Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya that had been inv@@ oked his comments from the context , turns away from his mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a working version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ ality is not disc@@ ol@@ ve to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ anything , a poet of the eighth century , who remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ anything , who should work later on behalf of the c@@ ali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do not ?
the real problem so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are to be silent .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the Teacher &apos;s Association , with the jus@@ tification , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media concerning the problems that con@@ stituted the deep in the land root @-@ root corruption .
in view of what is the concert H@@ da@@ ib@@ s opinion , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a complete giving and win . Jordan has led M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - what it looks like this , it &apos;s sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , also from a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of it , his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience . &quot;
perhaps the region will explore the region with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental op@@ enness , and not through bom@@ bs , stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions and artificial nature . at least , he hopes it .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to pass and consequently resist@@ s resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is known as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one is presum@@ ed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which usually has been celebrated in many areas in August in many oppos@@ ing T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . a further theory has been transferred to the armies which mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the north @-@ east of Japan to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the k@@ nee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b us a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( Sum@@ t@@ l ) .
I looked for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two for@@ en@@ cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this history , because they are helping the Peru@@ vian youth from crime @-@ keeping and to promote a legi@@ timate profession as the hair@@ dress@@ er .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road@@ b and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region don &apos;t feel safe .
at the same time Peru is experiencing Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ dress@@ ers of famous sport designers such as Paolo Guer@@ r@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers who can make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ dos .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ dos that go to the utmost limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts to show opposite to each other , who can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks - how to see in the following video ( for further videos to current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found here in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing art , which allows you to find them work .
motivated by this activity and the offering possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession , currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud of being in love with children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love b@@ rie@@ fe to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the working copy of &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who know we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel confident , aff@@ ection and aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga von der Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation - and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , who encouraged young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa war letters .
only recently , their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was responsible for the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its in the Nobel Peace Prize .
there is still a long way before the Colom@@ bian country , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and around the clock their weapons had to be met again in the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases , must now record their ranks and support them in creating a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young Colombia should join together and assist in the integration process .
and they did that too : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back into the company again .
the objective of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that will then be personally presented personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Campaign
the idea for Recon@@ ciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cris@@ tian to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love thousands of love letters , but those who forget to need much need .
he said , he continued to share his love with people in this year , which needed the most urg@@ ent additions .
thus , the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their seats in the company and will show a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of peace to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be for@@ given &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists to bring the letters to personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC , as they had done it earlier , to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters of under@@ taking of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible , how many different feelings one can walk through only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that da@@ between lies , &quot; counted the political scientist Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca province , described this unforgettable experience :
having passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ u@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa @-@ fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa attack that wrote some .
I was afraid to go , because in addition to him there was a m@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ rower , a deadly weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answering said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something like a nice , so answer I looked forward . &quot; then , suddenly the t@@ ears came over the che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him completely , and set me beside the Pom@@ eg@@ rower .
perhaps he was too late to dress the war , all the years of faithful companions of this f@@ ights , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would have for@@ given me my mistakes .
but now I know that there &apos;s a company that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the beginning , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together with a discussion round .
the students had grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC has already grown in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared their insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years long have experienced , how the social inj@@ us@@ tice of the state to develop the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this magn@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to listen to these people , which had never had any hearing , and no election , that I had often seen as monsters , and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings , who were surrounded by their lives and their environment , was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , living in which the country lives , does it h@@ urt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused us to give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have been respon@@ ding to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian government was rec@@ alled that it would prevail peace after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
but that is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is entirely justified ( ... ) .
at the F@@ ARC , we now rely on peace , on a policy without arms .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to them - to rise above all those who dre@@ aming from a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution , and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . den@@ ying among us who defend life as the foundation of existence , will encounter many difficulties .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ ere people live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a dam@@ oc@@ lon@@ al value above the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y who has shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after several months ago , following reports were published that the tow@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ em@@ ian Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen Government , who had susp@@ ect que@@ er men and brought them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood they felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ et@@ ch@@ es of her farm &apos;s sex , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life she moved last En@@ des to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who raised in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he did a friend of my documents and spread them anywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round of my documents .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing so , some shopping lists from my cars , I heard a male voice say : &quot; here is a present for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned up myself , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t h@@ urt me .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still escape the family , you sc@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I don &apos;t know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the final end of the hospital in the hospital .
apparently , some women had to get lost and started to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in hospital I learned that I had two col@@ ds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which n@@ wing wings were laid - in whom the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , because my male name stood still , but the doctor stood and laid me to the women .
I am very gr@@ ate@@ ful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his offices , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am gr@@ ate@@ ful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they cried to me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ stand .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the requested , to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all a lie was a lie .
they found absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I must prove it without taking the streets ; others wanted , that I had not changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ y , and say that I wasn &apos;t changed my gender , that everything was worse , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people spoke to my mother once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , but not only your family , but the entire republic .
we can &apos;t stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , neigh@@ bors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dar@@ kened window discs and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was somewhat f@@ au@@ l .
my human rights friends convinced the number@@ ing number , - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ i@@ ded ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I will not give her name , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belie@@ vable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration without notice , without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the waste .
arrived at and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I set up the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wish to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you think about security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you are infected . they even know your room number .
only around &apos; s to prove : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex feel , this is a tab@@ oo .
I always carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements .
so much I wish to wish to overcome this past@@ or barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with the camera , I &apos;m really effort to view how the person reminds us of their past - so in my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends doing , those who have left ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has lost one @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so my I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; through blood is experienced through blood .
OC Media : are there still gay men aged in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there would be not very many .
if , above all those who have no rich relations , or the relatives of their relatives , to introduce themselves to Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are arrested there so that you can present them later than terror@@ ists .
say : if they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people would not have disappeared , but were targeted to radic@@ alizing themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is that now just a mut@@ ation or have you a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I quote somebody who was imprisoned for one @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their b@@ art grew .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply have taken her .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away .
however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise we would not have allowed to sh@@ ave this man to sh@@ ave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I kept my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems .
serious ! in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia would originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but finally put us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had colored eyelashes , made red@@ dish je@@ ans and short tops .
the security department of the aria has never made me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where there were several banks , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , arrived there .
we were never ins@@ ult@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ gro@@ unding : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not beyond the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children if they are talking about sick .
OC Media : so they just shut up her eyes off you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never have ins@@ ult@@ ed me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long does this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ age beh@@ aved ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als in television .
he spoke not over us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel like people in the city , to change .
who suffered and emp@@ tied in advance , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during the period , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not di@@ ver@@ t much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the U.S. are not much .
apart from that , I &apos;m still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re , G@@ ather@@ ings , I buried them to the hospital and help them to get food @-@ cards .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I ap@@ per@@ ed refuge .
I am Muslims and wants to help those help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s great .
so the nature , that &apos;s purely nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no spo@@ ols .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which cab@@ ines which have the Rus@@ sians also , there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m coming from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to listen to me .
so I come here so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
know , many think of tran@@ si@@ ti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that they &apos;re going to be gender , to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sty .
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ing to be exact , different vit@@ ational settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not , whether I have a partner , or not .
sorry , that I am so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad about this - I know that I &apos;m now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ant within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
the past few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ally .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dou@@ b@@ ted situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi fellowship in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the A@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and was ash@@ amed for his own help to escape the in@@ ability of his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s Human Rights groups who want to work and anon@@ ym@@ ously remain anon@@ ym@@ ously .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do anything more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists in the place of war@@ n that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ ate , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - e@@ dic@@ ed .
their stories together have a thing in common : all family @-@ fathers , who , based on the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ capable of thinking her families and work on a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a major part of Iran @-@ living Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to lead the local Arab population to dispute their lives .
before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy took power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most important farm areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy remains slowly , and the indigenous population gets only slightly from this wealth .
it often is victims of untreated diseases , hunger and dism@@ iss .
the Iranian regime rejected the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arab@@ s systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are .
these dem@@ ons have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ zi @-@ adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished an elementary school , completed 55 % an advance school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a blend of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial eth@@ ics , &quot; lead to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ dial amongst the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment became more difficult . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions are not preferred by Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will escape access to business opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance young Arab@@ s and force them to force their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside of their home Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre @-@ name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and not toler@@ ated Arabic name at the workplace as they are not toler@@ ated by the Arabic language or traditional clothes .
given the given circumstances , which have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up , eight of them .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education .
that women still stand under strict observation if it comes to doing what they can do with their body .
violence against women has a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ oner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet , when I &apos;m talking about skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black d@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have always been suffering from ra@@ cial , se@@ el@@ ically and verb@@ al women , as well as outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists should be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , however , everybody knows that women - everybody should come together , to raise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence , an institutional form rac@@ ist mo@@ ist violence , which we exposed black women to two times .
or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic groups are less deser@@ ted than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are instruc@@ ted as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women have been exposed to a higher risk of gender , domestic violence and violence in women &apos;s violence as white women .
on the other hand , I want to have all men , all men , and all men , neither skin color nor the same rights ; on the other hand I cannot take a motion on the other hand , in which the white woman likes to take into account of their thinking , which both relate to gender as well as on the skin color of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist self @-@ oriented sphere which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once said in her speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a dec@@ ar and mar@@ gin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to ru@@ b your eg@@ o@@ entr@@ e program .
I will no longer try to sett@@ le white women . because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to limit women from different backgrounds and to limit them from white Femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to resolve me fully and completely from Femin@@ ism , who was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist par@@ adig@@ m , that is so st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to us according to our own ideas and give us to the bear , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ laim@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) in which they are perfectly safe , and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call , after having read these lines , please contact the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist area I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this par@@ adig@@ m .
I will be recognised as a part of this par@@ adig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my existence .
I , a black woman , can flo@@ ur@@ ish in an environment , in which my life was neither received nor igno@@ red , nor rejected .

in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult battle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cr@@ ying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region to demonstrate their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which reports about the Ge@@ wal@@ let against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the persons affected .
a police company said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing to become violent by Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ partner who could become violent .
since the end of her relationship , some time have passed and the police said , their statement would not be laid to the acc@@ ents , but more could not be done .
when a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was useful .
a few days later the second woman returned their display .
to break the inflation of violence against women , it is difficult .
if women &apos;s first display at all , they do not receive any support from the Sta@@ ats .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who mis@@ sil@@ es them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution authorities .
content and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment and a li@@ tig@@ ation system , the non @-@ imm@@ ac@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays : good approach , lacking implementation and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that demonstrate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District Prosecutor of At@@ tor@@ ney , 9@@ 600 ads went on violence . at 70 % of this , it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads on the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace dishes . here , 86 % of women came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically handic@@ apped , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
however , these statistics do not show the true exclusion of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of these criminal charges are also re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed . &quot; on every woman who will not do for mental mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ se because of physical mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay , there is no own criminal law , the prosecution authorities can not appropri@@ ately documented how many women are murdered by their current or former partners .
in August alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence through men .

invisible mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , which affects nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z , the firm gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that , it should always be ber@@ ed for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but two years long , she carried away the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable :
I have never thought that I would be victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
when I read earlier , I thought that only women has happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they fool themselves of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told , as he had isolated .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever had his hand against it , and refused to be refused that his behavior was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had failed so long from Carlos , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove their former partners .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women , which are victims of mist@@ re@@ acts .
in the group , they can talk to others via their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse .
their well @-@ we@@ al@@ thy partner was finally able to persu@@ ade them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads on the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against their former partners who developed himself to an un@@ predic@@ table legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays : good approach , lacking implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of failure is a path full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks before , fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and har@@ der than it was the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legis@@ l@@ ext was changed in some point to win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions are generally banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ished up to five years of imprisonment .
the original bill , planned , fore@@ most of the ( bureauc@@ ratic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just want to maintain and secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legis@@ l@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , abuse as part of human relationships will be seen .
here , a circum@@ ference must take place , that violence is no longer considered a little bit .
whoever is silent in view of these facts , he is taking part in that the perpet@@ rators of the offen@@ ders are coming .
we must first display so long ad until mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases of domestic violence was called .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gress@@ or to attack his victims .
the string of words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of the parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper continue to be exposed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the Japanese authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editorial offices of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he ab@@ ates one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and arrested before court , but returned later .
Oman is governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup .
since then , he suff@@ ers from his role as the only Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme National Council and President of the Central Bank .
the dom@@ ination of the Sult@@ ans is characterised by the poor efforts of security forces , especially the domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists to fol@@ ate , in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ained .
the authorities regul@@ ate peaceful and legi@@ timate activities in human rights , and activists , also activists , their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the arrest of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the freedom of freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported in Oman since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , established in the newspaper entitled &quot; High @-@ level Parties in Justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26th , 2016 . it was in the judicial authorities and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having placed judge of the Supreme Court in Oman , a judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a member of the editorial committee , charged from the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS saw the deputy chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who as editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was concluded on an in@@ defin@@ ite period after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on every way , including online , banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mas@@ k@@ at , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of mal@@ function of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of a violation of an audience and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of arrest and pen@@ alties at the amount of 3000 om@@ vian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one @-@ year professional campaign was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use &quot; an information network to spread material that could represent a danger for public order &quot; was found guilty .
a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was scheduled for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court spoke to Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced to Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his old prison sentence .
the Appeals Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conclu@@ de the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n returns again , the newspaper sees how to attack attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January the Minister of Information received a statement that was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , giving the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper .
the prolonged closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in recent times .
for further violations , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , shall be put into operation .
due to the prolonged closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Chinese authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the freedom of freedom of press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Ottoman authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condition@@ ally fre@@ ed ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of freedom in the country ,
4 . among all circumstances assume that human rights and journalists in Oman shall un@@ hin@@ der their legi@@ timate human rights work , and without fear of re@@ leg@@ ation measures , including judicial sc@@ ik@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defender ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and the right to assem@@ ble peaceful , supported and protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is only sel@@ dom or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urg@@ ent needs of the continent .
for the needs of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and mal@@ aria have a significant impact in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases through the phar@@ yn@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a big problem .
second@@ ly , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself , will focus on building own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the Research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epi@@ demic showed the first significant impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he worked on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ri@@ ans discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media concerning this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ eh@@ RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I supported the sam@@ ic National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents instead of being m@@ acher .
solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists to find projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who return or come here , for financing and development chances are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure corresponds to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very restricted understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion , based on the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should focus on how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students from all age groups .
there is need of special academic education , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and traditional medicine will benefit from this .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientist in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do and help to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; will change worldwide food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been involved in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ red@@ der , the first plant which has been cultivated and dev@@ oured by NASA &apos;s Astr@@ onau@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only achieved by its own an accident and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ varieties can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ched and so that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or gr@@ asp@@ ed leaves .
over the last few years , more such patents have been filed on more plants like grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists , and expert for food safety ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition M@@ orton still exists let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes care for it longer , since his work is still worth more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is when I lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders around whom I have to ump@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents will go into sal@@ ads .
and when they stand before court , no one can produce any new sal@@ ads , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tries to extract those features that he would like .
however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also attached a movement which is becoming increasingly larger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have refined and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of Sor@@ te Out@@ lan@@ tern in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; station . there will be tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT @-@ area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which provides alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ e@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ e@@ ders may also under@@ take that other seed can be freely used by them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to work with their seeds and sell it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow only other that you can do so , to cross their own varieties , and it cannot aff@@ ord - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ rons or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ üst@@ y views
for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds are good and the possibility of breeding plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
Sa@@ at@@ gut plays an important role in larger cont@@ ex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter or not only little to use seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasi@@ zes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; for example , we need control of ecological agriculture , such as it is good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , such as this vegetables are far@@ med on farm markets such as this vegetables is threatened , threat@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutri@@ tion@@ ists without seed effects is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other seed remains free of charge . thus , its occurrence is to be patented , Sa@@ at@@ gut , and plant @-@ characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are endanger@@ ed because the available Gen@@ pool is because of the always numerous outstanding intellectual property rights on plant @-@ material , which thus always reduced mobility .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . she found out that around one @-@ third of all the world &apos;s fleet features are protected as intellectual property , which means it is impossible to use plant bre@@ e@@ ders either .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ bo@@ xed plants like wheat in still greater style is patented as salad or carr@@ ots .
a Question of Vis@@ iting
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted tra@@ des@@ irable features - of such that their taste or colour is improved to such , due to those in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders is decre@@ ases by increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever , as the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is responsible for maintaining the genetic diversity .
it contra@@ dic@@ ts , however , the view that intellectual property is owned by other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the Protection of Plant diversi@@ fication Innovations . &quot; a patent is essentially taken , as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhib@@ its innovations , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton looks different to wait for 20 years until a patent expi@@ res , but certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long for plants , which are adapted to plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , would have already been lost .
however , the main argument for M@@ orton is , however , that genetic resources should always be a general public . neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ us incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers work their work .
this is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to take us impossible if we continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
in total M@@ orton doesn &apos;t distur@@ b itself to the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we do not create characteristics .
they form themselves , and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. State of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who produce a variety , has also its own values in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes on industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for which cultivation areas are needed , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is very gent@@ l@@ ated . &quot;
while several medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example , Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they can either re@@ ject the patent or do they keep it too expensive or therefore do not re@@ warding it or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders Frank M@@ orton sear@@ ches in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would be by avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ ents innovative would : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ ent@@ ate .
I need to keep new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , he is protected against competition , where@@ with it simply makes it pretty easy . &quot; global reson@@ ance
although the US seem to be a leading leader in the &quot; Open Source , &quot; but its concept spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which himself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . for ob@@ taining the seeds , the centre with farmers will help them to produce new varieties which meet certain requirements .
it also supports it to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation belonging to an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country , and due to the O@@ ss@@ i obligation , not just one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive executive of the European Union , the European Commission declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office , based on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed Systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed agencies and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsor@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ign systems declar@@ es that the organization is currently expanding a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official start .
a merger from environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development organization US@@ C Canada and Concentr@@ ation - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Concentr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a Sa@@ at@@ good @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of welfare organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents the opportunity that farmers will need to communicate and improve their seed policy , making it a stable supply of food .
in this report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasi@@ zed - an connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that they will soon be recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods is especially noticeable , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to clear the people that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities un@@ locked the contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on weekends , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook in which it might cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Rem@@ aining , despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who continue to defend the laws , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , so it was not so important to overcome the blocking of the world and not to ad@@ mit the barri@@ ers to fulfill the blocking of the world . we hope to fulfill our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cked the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking output of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ speaking network of Al Jaze@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of we@@ bin@@ ds to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the major data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ H@@ RI there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ da no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now , the blog was established to re@@ tire from the Egyptian government , even the aim of a attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider where it is native to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while visiting the student protests , and a video received how the police viol@@ ate physical violence against two students .
his articles are chie@@ fly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself into the sper@@ ity by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs blo@@ oming is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ t of blo@@ gs may not be important for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of an ag@@ gression ; an arrest , an ad@@ dic@@ tive murder , loading of the national Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs and any other web site , for which I worked .
2 ) You have demonstrated that I don &apos;t wrote for nothing . in other words , my words have an impact if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first I took it to the post of articles in order to kill the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , however , after they have locked him , and that they may be afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the bra@@ ve go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by changing Internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s have started .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content on the Egyptian Users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the customs decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population does not have legal basis , by which they proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officer was murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation the Ge@@ wal@@ tw@@ elle 2017 reached the highest status in Rio for 10 years .
the Global Justice NGO &apos;s non @-@ governmental organization called even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports such as these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
this was published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; That &apos;s not normal , &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual desire , etc . everything , however , will be published in the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to conclu@@ de our eyes as journalists prior to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is no occasion for pride , but rather a character of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war .
in the same video , a journalist discovered that it will be disclos@@ ed according to the institute for internal security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which will be controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
us is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot , and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of Mafia and their partner .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they can be used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed against violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion , following a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy by the media and could be terri@@ fied , responsible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - such as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ compl@@ ation of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war are also serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because this demands the state , means and paths that are typical for a war . to this , the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called Justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ illed in the north of Portugal .
two hundred forty persons died , and approximately 70 injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a day of state .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions in northern and centrally located regions of the country , spread over 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where the fires were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest area via satellite imag@@ ery , in 2017 alone in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - a surface of the Lisbon district .
so you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the visible tragedy
the objective of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures through the state .
people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to enter the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al made by the Federation of farmers in Portugal declared the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
these sun@@ day they did now@@ here : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy , as in June , could happen , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits will be inter@@ viewed at a high bran@@ ding risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for wal@@ nut , which had launched the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was applied by the municipalities , which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction activity of the case unless the applicant could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val was built in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ c@@ us emphasi@@ zed that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , like in an inflation rate , according to fires of this species always further spread .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal was added on October 15th and 16th , when people sought or attempted to contact the relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided by the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the Fire Brigade in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who follow the fires , the site counted more than half a million .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
just at that time he sat in Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of Gh@@ az@@ ni in Central African z@@ stan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother &apos;s mother wasn &apos;t so , she knew that she couldn &apos;t see her son very long - maybe even more .
the boy should breaking up the boy in the morning .
his unc@@ le would pick it up , and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e elect@@ oral party , was murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt themselves un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tible .
the Taliban kidn@@ apped for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took back in Pakistan .
a couple of years he worked in a co@@ ca@@ vi@@ be . the work was heavy and made it sick .
then , he took the what was left out of his little wage , and went into a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars , which were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in a superior building on the construction site , which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we suspended nylon before the open window , so let &apos;s not bl@@ ame at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af made his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made for a trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af , hom@@ eless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed twice a day food on extra aid .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for the past asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions that are the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Civil Society Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . &quot; there is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center , if they officially got an application for asylum - what after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers can go down months .
until then there are people who have no money for accommodation , either by the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it happened also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ beg@@ inner life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free from these conditions soon .
after he had made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings in the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that , after a while , he opened a second hostel , and a sn@@ ap .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Success Story is the topic of the &quot; Disabled Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureauc@@ racy , high tax and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghan companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants have been praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mostly origin@@ ate from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afghan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , range beyond the Italian cuisine industries and retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave inev@@ itable than teen@@ ager .
&quot; where one risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy , if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to get the same possibilities like all other . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also att@@ aches plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where humans are able to sell packaging and preser@@ vative technologies . &quot; thus , they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afghanistan on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament exam@@ ines legislative design , which is fore@@ seen that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a governmental department .
users would have to use the social networks , within six months after the successful legis@@ l@@ ature order to register the authority on the website of the authority , as well as its identification number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who missed this step may be sentenced to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sentence or the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of a criminal payment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was written by six@@ ty members , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament , and will be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP was filed , in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult@@ ing of the pre@@ sidents or a high civil war would be introduced .
Egyptian law is already pun@@ ish@@ able under Egyptian law as well as state institutions already pun@@ ish@@ able under the bill of law , however , such as jus@@ tify the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in detention .
in addition , this would establish a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom exists since many years in danger .
an important example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ mou@@ d plan Z@@ ID ( known as Sh@@ aw@@ kan ) on August 13 , 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who led against the military coup against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sh@@ aw@@ kan wa@@ ited like more than 700 protest participants who were arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , on May 20 , it was delayed , because the prison line had failed to dis@@ courage the accused by the accused in the judgment hall .
Sh@@ aw@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are conven@@ ed , head@@ load of such a weapon , illegal assembly , murder and an attempt of murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza told the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous post , for 25 years to 5 years .

this document , published on April 21 , on the Website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on it , such as the presidential plans to support the legislative situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , speci@@ fying Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press , which in@@ sures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the Regional Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
wants to force social media users to force their identification ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit before they write messages into social media or share them .
in addition , the registration is given in the rules that the registration will be required with the full name .
analysts assume that this will be achieved by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is now un@@ clear , such as the authorities will apply .
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to asser@@ t these regulations only sel@@ ectively , to protect the civil society and its independence .
