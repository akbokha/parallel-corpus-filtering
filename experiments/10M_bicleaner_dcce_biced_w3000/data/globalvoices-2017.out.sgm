<seg id="1">Although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American music is read, American authors read and run its sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had profoundly profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who discovered the top German conspiracy of a oil-Magnum, who wanted to occupy his interest with judges that wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "me was it if the absolute truth is, forget all others, this is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are, and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very dirty love letter above his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he moves with its narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statement and tuned for him in Donars.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number one ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support this biguary person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters in line with people that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, which takes people from around the world, a deep glorious human being, with whom I managed to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, Trumps are not backed by Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," translated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours so that "Phoenix Suns" play at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity of generosity, which I experienced by Sandy Bahr, who struggling with the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still fits them to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues, to pamper us the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were still Andrew dey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors that helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those given by them embodied my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump led his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, they found me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it emerged, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the argument with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they were either over racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to overlay these things almost the heart." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump-voters as rust.</seg>
<seg id="34">To sort the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most white are, for trump, because they want to rewin control over a country that it has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they didn't want to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who puts the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different as he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "wholelash" "" "(DÜ): as much as" "" "the White against all other Ethnants" "", "as much as Schendertrauma, as much as Schradertrauma, what exactly does the Great Van Jones" "", "did exactly what America did so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country has chosen as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaner, whose history, how he himself says, anywhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a giant large part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with manifold, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the rudder, say they.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all that I think of Khizr Khan must think the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they rieve them and their voices were pure.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "someone who doesn't have such a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no more space in this new USA.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic city of Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music, played in both places, does not only change the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-groomed ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has now been playing with children and adults of the symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome them in the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">Yet this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project, and the youth so a rare hopelage.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the bucket day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 km south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located on the largest garbage dump of Asunción in the capital city - on instruments which are manufactured from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler started to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all were made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez remembers a local artist teacher and music teacher at Cateura's children at the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had no place to contact the parents in the litter. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them don't live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra, which plays on instruments from recovered material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary Names "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) excels the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the ones - as humans are in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already been operated in Liberian waters of illegal fishing catch before it looked to the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were brought so accordingly and little geneives to welcome a criminal act of this way to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and Seychelles are rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to raise one of its harbours and refuses to travel to him a fishing licence.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that their simply refuse" "" "reminds of Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at a time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was removed out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch some fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, because of pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative was to cross the criminal practices and protects the resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar as prime minister had expelled their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are incongestions and work together. they are" "" "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: which is caught, hidden because it is extremely difficult to split, is the illegal fishing industry is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the intentional contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species may be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem damage, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once suffered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, these actions occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange different lists of existing licences, news for suspicious activities or details which had to be noticed or experienced during an dock inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if these move on open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark ships that fishing in banned areas - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its around fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly, whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries, which are against illegal fishing rods, can be denied by assumption of such ships in their ports, meaning that the ships cannot sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to count the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then, considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and this is what we want to achieve" "" "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">Closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform has been created, to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, representing the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing species that attract the area of commercial fish catch from around the world. among these also evilar illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices include actions, such as the sailing under false flag, fake licenpapers, specifying imagination protected species, fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and use the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "it could then say" "" "illegally fishing and a country could say 'You will not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale loophole try to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been uncovered criminal networks that had counterfeit banknotes in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, helps to split the illegal Ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, wherewith they can't be taken out of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it should help FISH-i to help criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana. it offers a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world's position.</seg>

<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has led a similar project, where a global system provides the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not merely encriminals, but also screaming.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that exploited previously without license and hardly to calculate with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i accounted for a 33% increase in fisheries, ever since fishing boats can buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to split Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With Security, the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent Member States reported his first big triumph: in October it presented Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without licence and have been banned by towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, as an adult male, Quijano, in the framework of the great La Perla-Ribera, in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">He started to bear the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child, 15 years ago, one cannot remember that man is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not recognize that my father was a thief, the terer and the robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieurter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974-1983, a period of state capitalism, his father was deputy commander of the secret division 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had witnessed the extent of the atrocities in the course of years, and that he had promised before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyoto. it was also that the local time to take attention to the local time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To survive, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in native language, in general the conviction that translators should not be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English to French into English - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the native language, which could translate translations into English. this may be attributed to lack of understanding for overtaking, cost reasons or relatively small number of English native language developers, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign employees can have translations, however, the Japanese employees, whose Englishness is best, - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">The translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrsely sets, which are created by machined translations, show that this technique may not yet replace human translators. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, among them also frequently use T-shirts or bags, are used only for silent reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless. but of big companies or by the government who have means to guarantee higher standards, can be more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of KYOTO uses a serious source of translations into the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Freies Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto PRENSA y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet disappearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also contributed images of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by oppositions, the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is to be coupled to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan provider may be closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venetians with internet access, especially in times of troubles.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitated since 2014 by the reporting on protests. then, the Commission for Telecommunications reveal them with purging and lockers if they continue to report on demonstrations, as the Commission would continue as a "appeal to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I have signed up at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two more online broadcaster. this also applies to the Internet site, to which the National Assembly transfers its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers may benefit DNS. this is a technique that defenact the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers or refuse the request when calling on such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elamoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was held in police hospital.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported to regulate Internet connections: this will continue to move the Venetians access to multimedia coverage through the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one described more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money survived their minderous son or her minderson's daughter to another, enricher family. in exchange the child will receive food, education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, however, that the children must do countless days of homework, which will never be paid, and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised in part of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, known as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and many other complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness, researched and pranged.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to give things to name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated to Criaditas.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "there is a family that her daughter is in faith, that they will make their education to improve their position in society and" "" "something out of himself" "" "can be translated to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes the girl with itself and justifies the faith with faith, that she would not receive a chance that would not have been an apprenticeship and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret in paraguayan households, has set a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of fierce punches. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military court Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer in the resident department.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in her house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometres east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira broke out as long as a stick to Marín until they suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They insisted that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply in the paraguayan society in the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest protest together and demanded that "no further Carolina" would be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photographs were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without Papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an immediate study of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case is come before court, the case of Carolina Marín might be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case from Criadazgo is coming.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbk worked in which her father worked, bankruptcy, and her father had lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all now and began to sell on the road or on the market confectionery to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of its employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It was on each morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">Ever more they had finished with learning, the more leisure had them.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "is the Persian, the only remaining smokers in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the memory of the ecosystem also depends on it, that a large Raubtier is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard really in the wild mountains is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video it shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, established for the Northeast of Japan, had been affected by the life of those who had been affected by the "Thirty Catastrophe," a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shenno-Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture, in Japan's prefecture, Miyagi prefecture, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone around 160 000 inhabitants left their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows out of local view that progress has reached six years thereafter to rebuild the life of local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re-building authority as well as survey results of the person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (including the "" "" saigai kouei juutaku) prefecture, Miyagi and Iwate, were finished. "" "</seg>
<seg id="552">In the three prefectures of Miyagi, Miyagi took place, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima operates with 70 percent the final.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated two years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsacu (', casetsu-juutaku) were transformed into definitive spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behel accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such courses.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima still live in emergency accommodations, whereas Miyagi was successful in emergency accommodations. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which were placed after the disaster in Behelworks have been planted in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, this figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">Status of working and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">According to the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the misfortune, which opens up to nearly 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial renovation in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fisheries ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation once again, in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fisheries ports have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land have been huge.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmers in Fukushima can be used.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of atomizer, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmer by Fukushima, lying in the "nuclear weapon" zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovering again, but also Fukushima remains far away again.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their lives.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a whole image, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuation. she inquired about the state of rebuilding and how you changed empire towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken hold on future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents have not yet been done enough for catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increased its attention to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic eruption, atomic misif to experience Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the end of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuees are still more than 50 years old. they are able to compete with massive construction projects, because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, are involved in construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people meet people from other countries that speak another language, the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one knows that more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices to remind our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, let's take exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that earn less attention than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five global Voices members who remember at a moment in which they have felt very closely linked to anyone about language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikony talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love to live in common language skills throughout the world, where she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were installed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exploring the sugar cane industry in the region, the sugar cane industry remained silent, and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the scaffle of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some variety the work.</seg>

<seg id="634">He heard that it works in the east of the sugar cane factories which are back in operation after a long period of time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something, what he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls itself exactly that MañalI would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiencies, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced amount.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the land before some decades, but the bad harvests are no more new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway line of the congregation saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and barely competitive they were not competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plantations and the strain crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased again approximately one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar is between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report" "" "Agricultural Perspectives" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture Organization." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will go down with security in history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">The process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the downfall of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same was in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich am 14th May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez served in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, is talking about the closing of the factory, the word that he is repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same mind: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive this place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first running year, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially collected around the official documents, which would only be found in terms of the parts that would be removed from the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were increasingly frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money insured for the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory was closed, or better than they started to uncover them, they also listened to asphalt road, these disadvantaged, also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to request other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were share to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not for the supply of the community.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths from the First Nations communities across Canada are focusing on topics that are important for them. they do they do with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour we bring mobile audio studio direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec, with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that young participation in conversations themes such as "cultural identity, speech, confrontation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>

<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always have to rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a stanza in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel myself, nobody ever would ever be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and geared regularly occurs only in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy, which brings together this struggle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of the Sinaloa Cartells, urged the stories of the conflict of conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, someone looks at the grief or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bodies, behind every bone fund in the hundreds are married tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds will probably never cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal animal político has created the digital project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" (german: "with the drug trafficking,") that this victims should give up a voice and tell stories of people who put in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organic Crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and leave all the churches to get a little as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">We don't just show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community, conflicts, fragility and citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a bookmark by Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution is reminiscent of us that violence should never consider as normal, no matter what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been known illness and sensation journalism now for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come back to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel the feeling that I am the only one that is impaired or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin think when he is large, and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "Labours" of criminal offences when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is that, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who fear him also something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to mere numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour can be justified that they were" "" "raised" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're talking to say that they may be spared of such tragedies when they are not stirred and quietly.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main city district:" as a family has been plundered for month money from their business, until they did not only destroy the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost, and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes beyond that trauma remains, fear is up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits has changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">We continue our each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because they don't know when they will kill you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in this terrible days, whether weeping my deepened feelings would arise, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to live. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells you that he had to teach himself like an egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bein - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a young woman who had to come from violence and learning to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, man told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody bodies of his father had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city of the world because of the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor dropped 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who cannot be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcoals, whose goal is to include the complex information behind the failed fighting against drug trafficking, which contains the country in the past four decades, in understanding of the country.</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows of concave body which rises up on the ground while looking for people.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story finds its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was seen several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but unfortunately, in the context of the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the metalerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and glued in roads and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "nobody remained back to count dead," said to human rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on satellite images the follow-up could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the armies left in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, country to win (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here, the picture from the DR Congo was back on, as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Actually, this abstained use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mischiefs; Africa's Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was introduced as proof of mass surveys.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange appeared in connection with the deadly pursuit of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee rape, rape and certain deaths, some of them are burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following, which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi-Arab News page, which claimed in 2012, the President Myanmars Than has said, monks and politicians have used to participate in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to imagined these information.</seg>

<seg id="913">As the picture later, in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram of 2015 in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist connections to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathed as proof of the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages that were combined with no religious context were taken out.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to set attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Maltese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message he was reportedly written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, in circulation, it translated discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to falseate.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (indentations) that passes these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions about silence in the context of Christians by Muslims or for the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life can be evaluated by a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to investigate as pictures in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can't give this pictures longer than belief.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are dirty people who have unintentional to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "suggerates this mood of false - and false information that the true atrocities are untrue and does it tastes like what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread violent pictures has been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal equates to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern, that nonfiction pictures and spectators will take advantage of empathy and to feel empathy (such as this study, those subjects such as forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While some more nonviolent representations in the news media is the fact that it is indispensable for today's news report.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. undispensable) tries to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (as the famous Portuguese saucepan) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brakes).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, so why a full explanation and sometimes require some context necessary to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu Vanuatu language as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Check you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrrik language, spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- Comfort or laziness that you feel after cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, reveal other commemoration and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we can analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to show more of these "unnecessary" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to download their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and spit the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already been held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages are not admitted to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we do cities to accept the diversity - safe rooms in which residents do not forget to include them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "during" "" "during listening," "" "understand these events instead," "" "the listens to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story in their own language and translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation will result in that the audience is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughing and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the country's typical customs of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork from the bunny and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the importance of his fak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience, which does not understand your language?" with a broad grinlet, he shares his feeling of the inclusive:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project, can join TLS in touch to organize their own storytals.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for reenforcement of state debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, on April 3, 2017, various religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration; the march started the capital building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen front for the neural testing of the debt) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercession of the reenforcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros demands that politicians, brokers and government authorities, responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial examination and an Steering Committee without personal interests to the public debts, with a firm, our working conditions, which is acting in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be squeezed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-profit non-profit organisation without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of State.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside are likely to run without the participation and conviction of citizens, from among the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>
<seg id="1172">Here are some impressions:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The sycally-Palestinian WEBENTWICKLER Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has performed for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on digital culture that will be aligned in Berlin, devoted an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lase excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and released here, contains a series of attachments that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how moves for Freies knowledge, and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who have participated in the movements of Freies knowledge have side to page to see over the fog, who gives out our newsfeeds and create something to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Basque Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was dashed out of the Adra prison directory where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal lives and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">As Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us let us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given in this process of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The WEBENTWICKLER for Open Source and digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Basle had taken on the basis of a" strictly beheim "by the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who set itself as insidiary of the Assad government and set them by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a crucial role in the Internet and to know access to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the leader of New Palmyra, a project which established bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more foreseen as the work which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the way of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything that architecture, not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule created for the public, as well as scholars and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bastia could not unlock this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"" "" "" "I have spent my whole life with this, of freedom to dream, and bays taught me to embrace them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel was translated with me in English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well. I learned to speak and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet with me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also contributed other musicians, such as computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi also wrote the author of Waiting (Warten auf, Waiting), a trial for her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was imprisoned in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She braked the lyrics with him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I was in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I left the contemplation in the moment where we embrace the poor,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter?</seg>

<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">To retrieve all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And on your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I create myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During</seg>
<seg id="1245">In your cage, I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still In the cage's cage</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bashar al-Assad's regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or were arrested under force of violence against the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community calls for the release of bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat today our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: convicted of convicted and convicted of corruption because of corruption in corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mosambique reacted with anger on a corruption of corruption, returned by a government member after half his sentence to the workplace in the State apparatus where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by Diodino Cambaza, which was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was bordered by public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza was named between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guided tour and immediately requested his resetting into the company, which was then on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the General Attorney General of the Republic who claimed the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, where the company had no discipline after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The center for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), an local institution which sets itself for public transparency, denounced the decision of the company, the Director of the Company, the Director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "poses a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we think is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contradict dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company though apparently advising appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior and considered "resisted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would have been adviser after he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speech, he could advise and his image stops.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has velled to reintegrate it into the company, which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza would like to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Not contradiculous!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Biton Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewards the state because he can't believe him, I can't believe anyone who has been rewarded with such a way that the state has already been massively belated.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morality and to serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but himself only served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, in order to get a inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man has become tired, the pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mosambique's prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, cutting and - next to that - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous renal representations was, when he was vigorous, "an ambitious human being able to sell his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious human being changes, my experience shows that the tactics will change, but he doesn't turn away from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">Reactions were also accepted in Twitter:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to unrighteousness</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" signifies chickpeas or spage.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from net, because they contained the word 'calar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although about the origin of the word still is discussed, it is normally used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censored the word "Kalar" or "them" (in burmesischer script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hassunciation in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight Hassunciation in Myanmar, the company has licensed a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word that doesn't call itself automatically Hassle.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts for his use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmeso words with basic various meanings that have the same sequence of letters like 'calar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also'Kalar htaing ', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' calar pae '(chamelbow),' calar oat '(curtain) or' calarcaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they could cry out how he could relieving his back pain by drawing a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The movement ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that she will decrease native language radical nationalists, but also emphasise that facebook can be analytic, before it glowing all the Posts dissolved in the suspicion of suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook etes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, is carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (switch verses).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, the Hassest language, receive quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action shows a strong signal to all, the Hassle may spread, the efficiency of this strategy is not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have demonstrated that the censorship of percussion is often a catz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative notation of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his podium as he just wanted to communicate his friends, that the word 'calar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to communicate my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post and share of contents for 24 hours is prohibited because the Post "does not escape the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views on the hate's radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed, which has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Postal without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author distributed its opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community should ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that as if they started doing this without local context or technical support, and so words such as "chair" or "Insencurry" have banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not make mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would have a great revenues, would be the great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has catered for a lot of spiracy under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking serious, users now have fun and write the word 'calar' not in the context of Hassle to see if their podium will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate language, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I'd like to sit on a chair and look at an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Next post: if you're a doctor, do you cure people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, social networks have been used to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassunciation in social networks will also have to preheat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been responsible for his failure that shouldn't speak against his burmeso pages under control, criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply shaving the word 'calar', it would have been better to look more on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's departure is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously a law which aims to prohibit this practice so that the married couple now is 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage, some members were Hindoo and muscular religious denominations in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, who had gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country, that the state will not be mixed, since that, age does not constitute the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was unaware of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors of the United States, for every person under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 already married in Trinidad and Tobago by 2.8 percent, and 18 percent were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the State's statistical office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were grasped to abolish the laws, followed by the foot and rejoiced great support. without doubt, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the Critics of the Children's Before, they should not take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was uncomplicated for stresses in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime would happen if the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, in early 2017, the bill of law had decided - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that could be discussed, so that it could be discussed in the representative office, where a simple majority would take it to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now, only the President of the country must agree, and proclaim the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the broadcasters of the country gave Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle released again on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill of children was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not only one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being previously approved in the Senate, the draft plan can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was thrilled because the laws have finally been changed to children's before.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, and he seems to be emptied to his promise.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Turkish users can view their Wikipedia content through the rules of websites.</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English language of Wikipedia was published on January 18, 2012, mutually to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey unlocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more clearly how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV-series defend against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicians of Internet users are used, use power tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey does not fall the third largest VPN prevalence in this category).</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked in an article by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held since 2007 after the Internet law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirrorsides (pages, which are reflected in Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia-sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-Calculator connections), which does not support a complete censorship on the system of domain names.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is irrevocable in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to push Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least any Wikipedia content, even if they can not reach the website www.wikipedia.org self.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to renew the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has released both tr.vikiansiklo.org, an open source project, as well as WikiMirror that everyone can use similar gland pages to hoists when in their respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and Staff at Mozilla within the Panigrahi's Open Face "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is accessing another URL, which is not the original. that's what you can see, is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server led the request to the correct Wikipedia-page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server, which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the border of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home, when me suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was found and I immediately started to kgging images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar stands for collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepalese nature and would like to understand understanding that wild animals are not so furious as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was face to face from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of sheep not when sleeping!!</seg>

<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, its passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until it took a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanfoa, and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with greatest care should avoid the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a prism or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect for women's husband, as well as fear of consequences, they should consider the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to death from the Indian state Odisha through a pseudo court and attacked by their family and the village community, having addressed a married relationship with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also doesn't have their wives to name, is also distributed among men. however, they have far more far-right assignments. however, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walloim in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus rapidly become the main themes of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, to discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the community of Video Volunteers, and is committed to dismantling the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the association of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made it simultaneously for the change of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini presented in her discussion round, did women who call their husbands to call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has opted for this topic because she wanted to open the interview about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands are not to speak loudly, a brilliantly, whom they have not guilty and have never been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this is considered extinct, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made up to this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never had called her husband before, tried to try out at home, as soon as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-mother-mother and my husband still weigh as long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned aside to me, and said, I will call it by now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Bagini Rohini started their first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had heard the word "Patriarchate," never before. some believed that there was a good cause, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they may call us how they might call us, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in whom they brought the name of her husband to Maharashtra about the Breast of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, it was only cloned; another decided to allow all the sumpation of frustration against him and his family, taking him cursed.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the Adrenalinrausch, with an ancient spectacle, the women decided to actually try to call her husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they counted their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman proclaimed Rohini and asked what ideas they put to women in the head: his wife did not cease to stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it with dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">She waited for her mother-in-law, and she was afraid, and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying of the carcinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the interest noberred dot if it also works.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not completely heard it, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose it on some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion of discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are making a trip in each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure that women could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated their own birthdays in her life her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and talked about things that they had never made thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for many years now and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities to our husbands, never so honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great that certain things can say loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have entertained about the concept of glory and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a large shirt over a pants; they have not been married.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the benefits of its own clothes-selection, morality connected with saris and much more, schmuggelte Rohini had her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, if in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then heard it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear in any time ZinnoberRed on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the Feill for more freedom of movement or its own dress-election - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, you will consciously sit in the same boot.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us every one of us that will change anything.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman is living in the club and others, what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from exploited groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem to appear, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered as the city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of an meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York be a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is, although most people are getting a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a town.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Justice of Justice, "to turn logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and dedication to create this valuable country, we hear that we have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the shine of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory violation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam was not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared unsatisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the main point of the theme, the good old lyre of the authoritarian action of power, which will return democrats, leave the distorted logic when it adapts better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam's last week, answers to his American guests in regards to our press, our Judicial System, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions: he with non-replies rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since they did not understand these conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not country, but a city is to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be grateful when our werder K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point, if it was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he wrote concerning the criticisms that it should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to Singapore's statements and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was more a "city" to be a country, "he declared how the elections in Singapore are so unimportant, even if we are looking forward free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He received Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was no country, "he obviously didn't think it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment via Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I didn't know Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected to do with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure that he is really associated, associated and conscious of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "credited a mistake or was it a Freudscher speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Intergovernmental Register, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporean increase their military service, they defend her city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade for the years of exile, Singapore is always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have many Singaporeers to be offended...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a town / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear about "the defense of the country, especially," but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: as "cute" means to be known as well as the benevolent, gentle, but tragically important figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons' (who has one's own Canadian bikers).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "kind" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing but one can encounter with it.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means unobtrusive and ininteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be a good thing if you want to stay in the background, far from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire is free and alone to be a headquarter of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs to us.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I attended one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year old Mexican female, a small woman with a corrals pink Brillenframe and golden earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather them) became a target for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.2,50 Dollar the night can sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of african and haitianic migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people will come in full small buses and the upper part of the coast to call them: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's more quiet but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of them slept even outside on map.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys their medication that they can not pay, they mash them out of the long trip exhaustive feet.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him to ask if Mama Africa was a reasonable top name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to meet her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans, who are going to move in the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other drivers from Mama Africa. "mum Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and the Africans often travel along the route and that Afrikaner speak already on WhatsApp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers at the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">It has been a guest at Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he would have contact in the future with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go back," "" "We will always remain in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez told that her guests will send their often text messages when they continue to grasping or report her over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Don't know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman, and has found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar a night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking site outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what to do the guests.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there three years, he became a raid on his office from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels by Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-one, has offered their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses they consult the passengers calm their phone.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Today, a small coach has arrived and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of them that go away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she flaked in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair fleeing that her made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old men.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, the app" "" "App is" "" "to receive access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also use the app to use more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app will determine the sources and distribution of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, pictures, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of the nographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users to make sure how much time they spend and control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children to develop healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used naturally in many ways.</seg>

<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is often very often bleak for those who live in remote, afflicted ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>

<seg id="1979">If you be discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>

<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning meets the room ".Raus with you, arficker."</seg>

<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be silent, and walk away, you will be moved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoking a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text, recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of its time inside; sometimes he vets to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be forsaken, is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine adfasting lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family came to flee to their village in Palestine, where she had lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For now six years Hdaib is a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority of mutual opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapMusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals often with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian gearing, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find relevance in its hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limitations in his thinking, and he can carry out according to their own testimony which suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though it is not open, he will get a special ascent against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his sympathy for those who try to do in war zones anything, if he was born in Jordan, even if he was born in Jordan, and never before being in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life of life," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then, he adds: "I think that I am a man," while he was crushed into the water-soluble nest-cafe in two cups. it is the Holy month Ramadan; during that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot jitag has little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the flavored coffee and the vibrates of the Kent cigarette in the nose is primarily associated with freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan did feel like a prison in free sky, especially when one throws a glance into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to do basic things to do - as in the public during Ramadan water - to do not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry of Jordan did a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees, which support the Islamic State Front - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsarer Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert statement should be said.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert "Just" had been canceled because of sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's commitment in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which constitutes the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila describes the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "that continues to use an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may be probably not simply stupid rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear reality in Jordan contrasts that occurs in Hdaibs plant clear.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib used traditional gender standards, having formed his vision of fate from the fate of Arab women that have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown wife, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan has increased the number of "honors' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to human rights, Human Rights Watch therefore reached its culmination in 2016; however, Jordan was still lacking that Jordan was missing an institutional infrastructure to help protect women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on fragile fighting in 1954, women cannot be detained at indefinite time in prison, "and for their liberation, there is often a long-term bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the family's guarantee that the woman will nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, even prior to topics, that gathers in his country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib deny that his work is politically, however, that he's his music that's full of expulsions on sexuality, freedom and opinion, is not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "me was riched politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically maintained in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and every other is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a way, in which one can get, "that's what you want" - be faith or non-Believe, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that no one speaks to Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya that had been invoked his comments from the context, turns away from his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a working version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuality is not discolve to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuanything, a poet of the eighth century, who remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuanything, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctifies the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the Teacher's Association, with the justification, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media concerning the problems that constituted the deep in the land root-root corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert Hdaibs opinion, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a complete giving and win. Jordan has led Mashrou'Leila, for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - what it looks like this, it's sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will explore the region with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness, and not through bombs, streetunitions and artificial nature. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will continue to pass and consequently resists resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which is known as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One is presumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which usually has been celebrated in many areas in August in many opposing Tohokus. a further theory has been transferred to the armies which marched from the west of Japan to the north-east of Japan to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knee.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab us a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (Sumtl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I looked for a long time again the Meguro Gajoen: two forencars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-metre-high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were so important as in this history, because they are helping the Peruvian youth from crime-keeping and to promote a legitimate profession as the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historical center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where roadb and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region don't feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru is experiencing Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and the unusual hairdressers of famous sport designers such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can make these elaborate hairdos.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdos that go to the utmost limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts to show opposite to each other, who can see the eccentric Looks - how to see in the following video (for further videos to current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, found here in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to get their weapons against hairdressing art, which allows you to find them work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offering possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession, currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud of being in love with children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love briefe to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the working copy of "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who know we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel confident, affection and affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga von der Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation - and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), who encouraged young people to write guerrilla war letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was responsible for the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his merits in the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is still a long way before the Colombian country, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons had to be met again in the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, must now record their ranks and support them in creating a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombia should join together and assist in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they did that too: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back into the company again.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The objective of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters that will then be personally presented personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love thousands of love letters, but those who forget to need much need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said, he continued to share his love with people in this year, which needed the most urgent additions.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their seats in the company and will show a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt reists to bring the letters to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC, as they had done it earlier, to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters of undertaking of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it's incredible, how many different feelings one can walk through only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that dabetween lies," counted the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca province, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Camuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla-fighters live), I saw a guerrilla attack that wrote some.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because in addition to him there was a mGL-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "hello, what do they just doing?" "" "he answering said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something like a nice, so answer I looked forward. "then, suddenly the tears came over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him completely, and set me beside the Pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was too late to dress the war, all the years of faithful companions of this fights, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would have forgiven me my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there's a company that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the beginning, students and some leader of the FARC came together with a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up as already war and the FARC has already grown in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC have declared their insights into their views on the peace process: "many years long have experienced, how the social injustice of the state to develop the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To listen to these people, which had never had any hearing, and no election, that I had often seen as monsters, and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings, who were surrounded by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, living in which the country lives, does it hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused us to give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have been responding to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian government was recalled that it would prevail peace after deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">At the FARC, we now rely on peace, on a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to them - to rise above all those who dreaming from a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution, and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. denying among us who defend life as the foundation of existence, will encounter many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2252">When she was growing, it became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, so why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chetches of her farm's sex, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear of her life she moved last Endes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a Transwoman who raised in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he did a friend of my documents and spread them anywhere on the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen Friends, with the following message: "then there is no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round of my documents.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still escape the family, you scandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I don't know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In hospital I learned that I had two colds in my right lung wing.</seg>

<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you braided?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I will not give her name, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration without notice, without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the waste.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checkered into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I set up the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wish to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you think about security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel you are infected. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only around 's to prove: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sex feel, this is a taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I always carry some traditional Caucasian elements.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to wish to overcome this pastor barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is life, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I'm really effort to view how the person reminds us of their past - so in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends doing, those who have left?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has lost one-half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So my I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end the so-called "glory" through blood is experienced through blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men aged in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have no rich relations, or the relatives of their relatives, to introduce themselves to Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are arrested there so that you can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people would not have disappeared, but were targeted to radicalizing themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now just a mutation or have you a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote somebody who was imprisoned for one-half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their bart grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken her.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise we would not have allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I kept my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious! in Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia would originally wanted to bring us to the" "" "Civilization" "" "but finally put us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, made reddish jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security department of the aria has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozy there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where there were several banks, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a regrounding: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte is not beyond the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children if they are talking about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut up her eyes off you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have insulted me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long does this Gnadensage behaved?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not over us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel like people in the city, to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who suffered and emptied in advance, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the period, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not divert much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the U.S. are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetre, Gatherings, I buried them to the hospital and help them to get food-cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I appered refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's great.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that's purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no spools.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which cabines which have the Russians also, there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm coming from there, so it's unpleasant to listen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2387">So I come here so many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transitity to men who love men, and they believe that they're going to be gender, to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusty.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensing to be exact, different vitational settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, whether I have a partner, or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, that I am so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about this - I know that I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of self-morant within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi-Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The past few months there has been a strong increase of self-morally.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August, the doubted situation of the Arab Ahwazi fellowship in Iran, influenced by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Awaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and was ashamed for his own help to escape the inability of his family, so Ahwazi's Human Rights groups who want to work and anonymously remain anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in the place of warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few other - Hamid Maniate, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - ediced.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories together have a thing in common: all family-fathers, who, based on the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and uncapable of thinking her families and work on a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a major part of Iran-living Arab Ahwazi's community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to lead the local Arab population to dispute their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab Ahwaz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most important farm areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy remains slowly, and the indigenous population gets only slightly from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It often is victims of untreated diseases, hunger and dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime rejected the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demons have only led to destroy the devastation caused by drought and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of co-operation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who finished an elementary school, completed 55% an advance school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a blend of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethics," lead to a "high rise" in the number of self-mordial amongst the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment became more difficult. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are not preferred by Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will escape access to business opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance young Arabs and force them to force their livelihood outside of their home Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre-name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, and not tolerated Arabic name at the workplace as they are not tolerated by the Arabic language or traditional clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, which have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is waking up, eight of them.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react, especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation if it comes to doing what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women has a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I'm talking about skin color, on racism, on black dis women, on black women in the LGBT community, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have always been suffering from racial, seelically and verbal women, as well as outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists should be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but, however, everybody knows that women - everybody should come together, to raise" "" "their voices," "" "to sing and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about sexualised violence, an institutional form racist moist violence, which we exposed black women to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic groups are less deserted than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are instructed as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women have been exposed to a higher risk of gender, domestic violence and violence in women's violence as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want to have all men, all men, and all men, neither skin color nor the same rights; on the other hand I cannot take a motion on the other hand, in which the white woman likes to take into account of their thinking, which both relate to gender as well as on the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist self-oriented sphere which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "once said in her speech," "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a decar and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to rub your egoentre program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to settle white women. because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional Feminism was founded to limit women from different backgrounds and to limit them from white Feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to resolve me fully and completely from Feminism, who was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm, that is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to us according to our own ideas and give us to the bear, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves) in which they are perfectly safe, and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call, after having read these lines, please contact the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist area I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment, in which my life was neither received nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police company said Ada Báez, that she had nothing to become violent by Luis Balbuena, her Expartner who could become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship, some time have passed and the police said, their statement would not be laid to the accents, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further woman Balbuena showed because of mistreatment, Ada Báez was useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the inflation of violence against women, it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women's first display at all, they do not receive any support from the Staats.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who missiles them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a litigation system, the non-immact3 Paraguays: good approach, lacking implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, researcher at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that demonstrate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District Prosecutor of Attorney, 9600 ads went on violence. at 70% of this, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads on the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace dishes. here, 86% of women came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically handicapped, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true exclusion of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these criminal charges are also reimbursed. "on every woman who will not do for mental mistreatment, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez, the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that, it should always be bered for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but two years long, she carried away the psychic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier, I thought that only women has happened to submissive, because they fool themselves of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told, as he had isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked the rhetoric, whether he ever had his hand against it, and refused to be refused that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had failed so long from Carlos, and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove their former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO network ("I believe you") which consists of women, which are victims of mistreacts.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others via their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their well-wealthy partner was finally able to persuade them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only seldom or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the needs of medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a significant impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases through the pharynafirmen are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself, will focus on building own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the Research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first significant impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he worked on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrians discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and misunderstandings of the media concerning this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit WarehRW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I supported the samic National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just stared a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists to find projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who return or come here, for financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work which you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure corresponds to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very restricted understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion, based on the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should focus on how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students from all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special academic education, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and traditional medicine will benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientist in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do and help to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" will change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been involved in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshredder, the first plant which has been cultivated and devoured by NASA's Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only achieved by its own an accident and the question how many Salatvarieties can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patched and so that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or grasped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more such patents have been filed on more plants like grain or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmentalists, and expert for food safety ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of millennia-old tradition Morton still exists lettuce, but it takes care for it longer, since his work is still worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is when I lie in a river a boulders around whom I have to umped." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a split with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents will go into salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before court, no one can produce any new salads, because all features are already patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tries to extract those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavored to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also attached a movement which is becoming increasingly larger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have refined and eaten red Römersalat of Sorte Outlantern in the "greenhouse" station. there will be tested, whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT-area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "open-source" "" ") is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "", "which provides alternatives to copyright protected software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may also undertake that other seed can be freely used by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to work with their seeds and sell it. "" "" open source "" "" breeders allow only other that you can do so, to cross their own varieties, and it cannot afford - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patrons or prescribed by many plant patrons. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Düsty views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds are good and the possibility of breeding plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Saatgut plays an important role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or not only little to use seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "for example, we need control of ecological agriculture, such as it is good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, such as this vegetables are farmed on farm markets such as this vegetables is threatened, threatens.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "nutritionists without seed effects is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make other seed remains free of charge. thus, its occurrence is to be patented, Saatgut, and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters argued that the future of food supplies are endangered because the available Genpool is because of the always numerous outstanding intellectual property rights on plant-material, which thus always reduced mobility.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has been engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that around one-third of all the world's fleet features are protected as intellectual property, which means it is impossible to use plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby assume that mass-boxed plants like wheat in still greater style is patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visiting</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted tradesirable features - of such that their taste or colour is improved to such, due to those in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreases by increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever, as the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company is responsible for maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, since "patents and the Protection of Plant diversification Innovations." a patent is essentially taken, as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different to wait for 20 years until a patent expires, but certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long for plants, which are adapted to plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources should always be a general public. neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetus incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers work their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it's impossible to take us impossible if we continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total Morton doesn't disturb itself to the concept of patenting plant features: "we do not create characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form themselves, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. State of Oregon and Ossi member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who produce a variety, has also its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"" "" "" "who believes on industrial agriculture with large farms and monoculturally," "" "for which cultivation areas are needed, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture." ""</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very gentlated. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While several medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example, Monsanto are) patents, they can either reject the patent or do they keep it too expensive or therefore do not rewarding it or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton searches in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be by avoidance of plant patents innovative would: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patentate.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to keep new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years themselves, "he says." with a patent for 20 years, he is protected against competition, wherewith it simply makes it pretty easy. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leading leader in the "Open Source," but its concept spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which himself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed programme. for obtaining the seeds, the centre with farmers will help them to produce new varieties which meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation belonging to an "open-source" license which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeding differ from country to country, and due to the Ossi obligation, not just one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office, based on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed Systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed agencies and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsoring seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" -Saatbenign systems declares that the organization is currently expanding a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems for the planned next year of the official start.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit-development organization USC Canada and Concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world, to publish the Seed Map Project, a Saatgood-map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a network of welfare organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - it represents the opportunity that farmers will need to communicate and improve their seed policy, making it a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - an connection, by the Luby of Ossi hopes that they will soon be recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods is especially noticeable, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "says Luby." "" "we now try to clear the people that even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities unlocked the contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On weekends, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a position on Facebook in which it might criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Remaining, despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who continue to defend the laws, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI, so it was not so important to overcome the blocking of the world and not to admit the barriers to fulfill the blocking of the world. we hope to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking output of the Huffington Post and Qatar-speaking network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of webinds to victims. @ anhri is one of the major data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access to the blog of the columnists and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Zida no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog was established to retire from the Egyptian government, even the aim of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider where it is native to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while visiting the student protests, and a video received how the police violate physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are chiefly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself into the sperity by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs blooming is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blot of blogs may not be important for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey the feeling of an aggression; an arrest, an addictive murder, loading of the national Security Council, blocking blogs and any other web site, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have demonstrated that I don't wrote for nothing. in other words, my words have an impact if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first I took it to the post of articles in order to kill the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have locked him, and that they may be afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by changing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs have started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content on the Egyptian Users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened that the customs decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population does not have legal basis, by which they proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to conclude our eyes as journalists prior to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video which was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is no occasion for pride, but rather a character of failure to be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist discovered that it will be disclosed according to the institute for internal security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which will be controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">Us is aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police, which only shoot, and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of Mafia and their partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than they can be used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argued against violence as "war." this is their opinion, following a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could be terrified, responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - such as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and historical and self-complation of public service.</seg>
