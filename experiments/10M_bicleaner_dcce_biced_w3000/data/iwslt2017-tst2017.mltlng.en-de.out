that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he had spectacular , that the N@@ SA has illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this article he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally announced plans for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but you know what the chapter is not right ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has established against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the government of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to condem@@ n journalists and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it &apos;s impossible to apply this right if medi@@ ums do not get this information , and if it cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ ff@@ ness that they cost .
so when the government was troubled , he did something that many bra@@ ve rep@@ orter did before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go in prison .
at the end of 2007 , R@@ isen has lived with the risk to go in prison .
but then , only days before the process , something exceptional .
suddenly , though she had existed for years , the demands of the government were inc@@ ur@@ ably dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and springs can always hide less .
instead of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing and scra@@ p to the statements , that also could do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were concerned , his telephone call ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ ana information , its loan information , and even travel information with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeffrey sterling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and a susp@@ icious source .
unfortunately this is one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much working as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security had the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
thus , we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has always increased more possibilities to all .
but just like technology the government allowed to ren@@ ew rights of rep@@ o , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can take it from the moment , in which they contact , rather than in the night , in the stuff .
today , there are communication software that had not yet had his book , and it &apos;s considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source translation system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working with which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as shown here by Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send documents as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and saved on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can &apos;t proc@@ ure any more information secret@@ ly , and many of the information you would like to ask , would not be available from before .
Secure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments have always developing new sp@@ ying technologies , which all end@@ anger ourselves .
it &apos;s to ensure that not only technology @-@ makers such as Edward Snow@@ den have one way to apply Miss@@ ing . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other environmental workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ ers@@ ed over abuse during the supply of soldiers . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or a Wall@@ street @-@ in@@ sider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crime , but to protect our constitutional law .
thank you .
&#91; April 3 , 2016 , &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ ighty &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s in tax h@@ av@@ ens have been hidden . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to a Declaration . &#93; This Week , we were organised by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a in Panama .
publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax h@@ av@@ ens .
we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge it ? &quot;
we really see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages , how the entire system works , how it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has come back .
there is also reports that a breed of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad rav@@ elled mail@@ box in tax h@@ av@@ ens .
it claims that a track of US $ 2 billion will conduct Russian President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous on the next release , and on the next disclos@@ ed documents .
now that sounds like the Plot of an agency of an agency or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems f@@ law@@ lessly removed from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax h@@ av@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this concern us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax h@@ av@@ ens are used by some few , to hide their wealth and wear -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax h@@ av@@ ens work .
I always set it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another firm , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand , who behind these bones .
it can be very difficult to understand criminal off@@ ences and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
presum@@ ably , because there were no prominent Americans that existed in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there is no sufficient Americans that tru@@ st@@ ain their assets in tax h@@ av@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which these tax h@@ av@@ ens work , Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to get a company to get a library of library .
this type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school@@ ing permitted to zoom out school children .
bedding is allowed to zoom out particularly vulner@@ able investors .
this kind of behavior , which affects all of us .
here at the Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how to see all this in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a home investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all until a lawyer may make suggestions for our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ten@@ sions . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no eman@@ cip@@ ation took money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that not as single cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who made suggestions to our investig@@ ating investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single leader , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it concerns how the system works , through corruption , control cur@@ sed , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to handle this , we must change the rules of rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very tr@@ as@@ ingly , as if we could not do anything , if anything might ever have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as being born optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has started to change .
in the last few years we have seen pres@@ sur@@ ges to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has collected in central regist@@ ers on national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is leaving behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ents , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we really would like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax h@@ av@@ ens , is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind head@@ sets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that arise and say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end this way of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can end up the in@@ transparency , which now allows this type of control cur@@ sed , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I had been kidn@@ apped , and landed in the trunk with a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ pack .
one guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked up my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me what he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he got the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows not the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I didn &apos;t know him yet ! he says to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning , I don &apos;t want to have been kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night , I stayed in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I rock@@ ed me ?
a wild ass in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sitting on the bed and shut down my sleep door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me , hangs today in his classroom . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that there were a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
I think , creativity can create it to transform fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I &apos;ve got over it . our apartment is going to stay for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi , and a desk , with a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it super , and we also .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ett has completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them all the city . when we held our last guest at the castle and the door was pushed into the castle , then Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we can find new friends at the same time and have to pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former roommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out how to make it a business concept .
we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the type of rooms , their doors are close when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay at them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the miss@@ ile would be light .
but she did not .
no one who is still quite near Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in dwellings of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all children , stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you think about the things that you can well . we could des@@ ig@@ nen .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design lots of more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create through design immen@@ sely confidence , among people who never had previously made .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create with Design Confi@@ dence ?
I want to give you a tasting dress , which degree of confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your compass .
thum@@ bs up , when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locking mobile phone with your left seat .
this silent beg@@ ough by Pan@@ ics , which you can now see -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel if they open the door first time .
for the only thing which is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors cannot only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel , if they lodge in different ways .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who now has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the position of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you &apos;ve wit@@ nessed what kind of confidence we want to build . I &apos;d like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented with his name ; if he doesn &apos;t tell whence he comes , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you have 150 covers , which all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel , if you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did not make some things wrong .
it was hard to spend the people , neg@@ atives distri@@ butions .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and host their ass@@ ess@@ ments , before we set it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we tested a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how similar to the age and residence .
little surprising , we trust the people most that are most like us .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
that is a natural social vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ious .
exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case through ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if one has less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything change .
a good reputation in common areas .
so the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deep gro@@ ves .
in addition , we experienced that confidence is dependent on how much one is reas@@ on@@ ably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
how much , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimum degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great artwork in your home ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text . we also give tips to which themes should be writing a bit .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
with what we didn &apos;t reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to sett@@ le this pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
fir@@ stly : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the rel@@ ent@@ less work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need which had not been covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are also times when not going smoothly .
there were guests who are not allowed parties have been celebrated or homes devast@@ ated .
hosts will leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I participated in customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front front , if confidence has broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s already h@@ urt when I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment which is h@@ ears in the voice of the attack , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue improving us .
fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays only a fra@@ ction ever had a problem .
for people trusted in each other .
if confidence is working , mi@@ racle can arise .
one of our guests did holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect home for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save the lives , even though they don &apos;t know it .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel it , they bring them into books .
they can even stay longer , without charge the Extra @-@ Nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay .
but these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked me :
how does the thought of sharing with monetary transactions work together ?
it is about economic trade here .
but it &apos;s just to give it a &quot; rental industry &quot; but the thing is not righteous .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of itself , and that changes all .
if you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less auth@@ en@@ tically .
however , what would you be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be when in every place where you visited , a group there would be waiting to wait a thoroughly and one at a pub @-@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or when you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from reason to inter@@ connecting ?
what would that look like ?
what would be , if cities would be shared by the common thought ?
I make cities before , which allow us to make society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and amor@@ tisation .
in South Korea , Seoul has already begun this project . lots of parking spaces , which belonged to the government ,
among those people were offered , students that were looking for a lead ,
were medi@@ ated on humans and their children had gone out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were started ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 000 people in 191 countries will host a stranger with stran@@ gers or themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality had already existed before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noted that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome , deep@@ ening pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right to overwhelming .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da pass by me .
we naturally know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ taking a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or just a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so , the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would no Muslims know .
probably people do not speak with their hu@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it is great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee maker -- twice espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ ower @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ a ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sing , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten .
no , not as an hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist gir@@ l@@ friends were ent@@ angl@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ ve was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal .
I did not just assume the faith of my parents .
I started with the Kor@@ an .
I read him , thought after , proved in question , du@@ bi@@ ous and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ o@@ tion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of Rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to we@@ eping .
I recognize myself for myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody takes you to perc@@ eive you completely , and yet loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started as all the Egyptian Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember , where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , in late breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ an &quot; .
there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people don@@ ate from buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into in@@ dig@@ nation rapidly .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the TV channel and heard it : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; j@@ ih@@ ad ... &quot; ... , &quot; Bom@@ b M@@ ec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed the works of others from a citizen into susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how we drove me -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully , &quot; &quot; A@@ ries in well @-@ lighted areas . &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering together .
and again the war@@ nings , &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the emotions were understand@@ ably filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who was born to Muslims in the Free University .
there were really bran@@ ding suggestions on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because people who had attacked this land had attacked our country .
I &apos;ve wit@@ nessed the gu@@ ards of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain through ongoing itself .
I have nothing about questions , I love questions .
there are alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can indeed hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my municipality like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : one mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole or a ben@@ ign tum@@ our just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , assist@@ ants and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America saf@@ er ?
there might be some parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque causes people to consider any other faith toler@@ ant , and bigger citizen participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington area , D.C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : people actually won &apos;t be radical in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radi@@ alized in their cell@@ ars or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radical process , it has found that it begins online . as a result the person of its church can be cut , even by their family , that the person believes that terror@@ ists are ab@@ h@@ ors the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of how the IS reach their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups asser@@ t their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you th@@ rows a look at them , they do not say what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; las@@ en in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s their brut@@ ality , which they can see these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me an astonishing story :
a girl came to him because they are more up@@ set to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him to have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom they had spoken , she brought her wrath to silence in the world , they would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing , inspired and something that had given to her rage , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who had a solution .
this im@@ am presented the connection to God and its church .
instead of bl@@ ame them for their rage , he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world .
as I learned in the mosque , they kept it before the IS to close .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia hits me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day rely on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence studies -- show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you submit reviews messages in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted for military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it actually may be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we perhaps feel as the first , but the toxic air of anxiety .
in reference to collective inno@@ cence , it is not just about to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived at Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me , that he was the most ad@@ orable and most generous person who knew it .
she visited him there , and he showed her CV . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is my bro@@ therhood , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne at her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had posted on the afternoon as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot only be imm@@ oral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or we stayed at home ?
we discuss it and for us it was no slight decision because it was that we would leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one , in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
our son in the nur@@ ser@@ y we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , and went into the prayer of prayer , and what I saw , he left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then , the im@@ am got a announcement , be@@ ware and welcomed our guests , because the half of the people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to join us , but to join us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion , pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on # Safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those who are .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a min@@ v .
but I wonder what say you think that you may claim a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought with deep monuments , i.e. one exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , fool you not . I &apos;m completely normal .
I &apos;m no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual , as it is allowed .
when people look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosper@@ ity for the family , they want labour , and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any respect .
if humans appear usually , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , shortly before , to become a li@@ fel@@ ong business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air parc@@ els in our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines at F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bri@@ cks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting you reach high speed and acceleration in nar@@ rowing area .
you can also build self @-@ controlled structures .
they learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence , and generally react to natural laws .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it has to know collective radiation where mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects in order to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , set calculations on board that should do the machine .
external commands are available on the highest point . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine , tried to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other strong gli@@ ders , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ wings it can die , and thus has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane doesn &apos;t matter to achieve optimal position and improves performance by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the cause .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icop@@ ters are known about machines with thousands of moving parts , which are mir@@ ro@@ red to bre@@ wing you .
decades ago , the pilot @-@ controlled pilot devices could fly , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
un@@ long , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ internal , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no other rotating drive or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inner life has very much , making it stable and can move in space .
nevertheless it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm in the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to take it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that it is really right now , is small , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the monster is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is not balanced .
therefore he is the ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
he receives the great skill ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flight machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller @-@ aircraft engines .
these rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a little push -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls from , the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine even if restricted .
we will demonstrate this now by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we recorded commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will hopefully mo@@ tiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ ing would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is salary in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in so spectacular manner .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bag pointed out on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ve each other in a very far distant galax@@ y . they turned three bore@@ holes in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
this short moment , they illuminated brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the universe .
it was a very big pop .
they put their energy in the form of light --
we eventually speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time tissue , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , multic@@ ol@@ dy life was created on earth .
since then , the earth has revealed a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cute -- R@@ ai Weiss decided by the MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies , that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much har@@ der work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O has increased significantly , which significantly improved the detection performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O has started to clari@@ fy several smaller , hard @-@ st@@ ub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than these :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my to@@ ken father .
basically , the fruits of my life were basically .
all this , what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black sol@@ ves and her by ob@@ servatory like L@@ IG@@ O . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a boost in the structure of space and time .
during the pass of the shaft the room and its entire content will be stretched out into one direction and cook in the other .
to illustr@@ ate l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers in c@@ sen on the theory of rel@@ ativity often a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stret@@ ches and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched out and stopped by us . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the L@@ IG@@ O employees declared to be crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absur@@ d , this length would have to be exactly measured than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear power . this is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on gravitation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ cists are dar@@ ily and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O be more one ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things about us : facial expressions , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by allowing you to perc@@ eive the light of several points around you .
with tones , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that are especially important to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we can listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and level , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it .
&quot; now Alice is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can make no simple pictures of objects in all applications .
but having regard to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are at the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
if we convert the wave pattern in sound , we can listen to all the literally .
the gravitation to lau@@ gh , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where@@ with my colleague Scott has already been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , it sounds the same circulation with an additional tone change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a type of movement wor@@ ch@@ anger , highlighted in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - hear L@@ IG@@ O following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; J@@ oli@@ a , knows this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rot@@ ate about as quickly as the bars of your mixer .
AA : we &apos;re just considering us what this means .
two black holes , the most common body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ s , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
it consists of the sustained meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it was never before .
on this path , we can listen to the All and the In@@ visible .
much in all , we can -- practically or fundament@@ ally -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ t stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the All .
however , the thr@@ illing physical processes occur in the core , which is behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see that these op@@ a@@ que are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , when it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ ine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the ur@@ ine will be covered by his own ob@@ light .
by using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to recover until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see , and of which we have never seen . things that we can only discover when we hear .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the same in the first attempt of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars that were observed in black holes such as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so@@ ften the suction no@@ tions for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to view a completely different point of view on the events of the stars , and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be beautiful , as the jung@@ le to lau@@ gh himself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say about all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous , I brought me in un@@ pleasant situations I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I like to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live in television ?
no , but yes !
do I want to begin with the Schau@@ spiel ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : precisely that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear , talking , my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my smallest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls out of un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; notes , I need milk for my s@@ ails . &quot;
she asked them once if I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there I s@@ wollen me to play with them as soon as you can take me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where to go , I say always Yes -- each individual time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it has also been an amazing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; means to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create hard TV . I &apos;m producing television .
I &apos;m doing television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each programme provides hundreds of jobs , which previously not existed .
the budget for a tel@@ ev@@ isions can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three shows that simultaneously are four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created itself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to assem@@ ble my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who that still makes it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why am I a Titan .
dream job .
I would not want to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author . &quot;
I tell you all of you that work so hard , if you &apos;re doing a company , a country or a class room , make sure you understand that I don &apos;t just say on the computer , so that I say : I don &apos;t understand that it goes on a dream job not to dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it &apos;s when I placed troops , I painted them on a canvas .
thus one can make a high tone , cast a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ised and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and dist@@ rac@@ ting , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , gr@@ asp@@ ed and sensible . it is the best of it .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum sounds like a lively street , I could always go on her .
many people take away if I declare the sum@@ s that I write to them that the writing is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with television when I started to work and work , to create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ mon is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you cannot be different than any size .
the feeling , not unlike any size , regardless of size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of his failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for failure , and I don &apos;t know that I love the sum@@ s .
I want to tell you only , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make one clear : the more successful I will , ever more persist@@ ed limits , the more space , the more work simultaneously , the more things simultaneously , the more things simultaneously , the more things I write history , more than I write history , ren@@ ew more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stops .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , over@@ drives .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine was silent .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ gre@@ t , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , with all your hearts , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do when doing what is doing , the work that you love , suddenly do ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le dich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the author of the author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re working to be a teacher that doesn &apos;t like to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s stops already when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song sound of my heart , can I survive in the silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ States @-@ wa@@ it@@ ch &quot; constitutes a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am going out on the way to the outside , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will tell no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I must say Yes to say and second@@ ly , she called me no . &quot;
they don &apos;t call any@@ body else . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I &apos;m cr@@ ush it when I got Titan bin and my sum@@ s become more rough , and here everything change my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
that &apos;s nothing special .
we play and play her sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read out dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness , and lack of Sum@@ eri@@ zing , can &apos;t make anything except fit .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything which exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ ors and song , in which it &apos;s watch@@ ful , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere , peace and simplicity is .
the air on this place is so short that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I am .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy stroke comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly because , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who , if I tell you , who am I &apos;m writing by means of programmes and television hours and how to work my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river which comes from life @-@ lust .
real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sum@@ s are igno@@ red the printing of history that are used to do the work , anticip@@ ation and print .
genuine sum@@ s is simple and original .
the genuine sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed to me the false words , for which God said to me , that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I do this for a fixed rule , so I can release myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any gu@@ ilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish , it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play not on me as well as working .
the truth h@@ urt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am better at the workplace than at home .
this con@@ fes@@ sion is pain@@ ful , because what a man is better to work than to be home ?
now , yes , I .
hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too excited , is none of them .
we turn around and back in the garden , and back , and her .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ushed soap bub@@ bles .
yet I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always attack@@ er my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe satis@@ fies me .
I play and play till I ask myself : why did we ever hear with playing ?
you can also do it ! say it always Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day@@ time instructor .
since you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones would like to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they do not want to make something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ day or bis@@ cu@@ it will be replaced .
and speaking my teen@@ ager @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes more need it .
everybody can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even on a to@@ e @-@ w@@ une day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ rac@@ tion .
the day is short : dinner that make the children ready .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s of peace , a place for his peace of peace .
it &apos;s not going to play with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
around the &quot; games &quot; generally .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m sh@@ atter and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in the piece , why do not treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s appears to return if I &apos;m not working .
works don &apos;t work without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months then opens a door to the energy flow . I hear me into my office . I hear me into new ideas . I use it in full moves and love my work again .
I like those sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... not anymore .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
that is my sum@@ s now .
the sum@@ s of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so gr@@ ate@@ ful .
it &apos;s going to tell me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the Sum@@ mon . the land , which I run , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the rest , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more power makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of feeling in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know that I am .
I am an author . I think of things I aw@@ aken you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ bo@@ omer@@ ate .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I &apos;m Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after an automobile accident .
it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capability for self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that &apos;s probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor , the tried to improve nerve function by various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Low@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation , &quot; which im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ gen is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior manager and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is sw@@ elling and the cran@@ ial pressure is stim@@ ulated .
to save the lives , one must decrease the skull pressure .
it sometimes needs to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen cer@@ eb@@ ral mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a slight task .
cells from one tissue grows to grow comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments where they can flo@@ ur@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly that we had to make with these cells .
after many trials Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he looked at his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a family cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ pe cells .
perhaps you still know from the Biolog@@ o @-@ Less@@ ons that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain tissue in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells continue differently .
they came slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like family cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ant cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear but clearly -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows bra@@ ins .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cul@@ tiv@@ ate the cells so as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mar@@ ker in colour to track them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted it at the entrance of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ian transplan@@ tation -- car trans@@ coding .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ itate this cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant the same cells in fo@@ amed bra@@ inst@@ ances ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ tes we could work with wise monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained . they rose to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , are these little points . these are the cells that we are in vitro , in the culture .
here we could not cease .
can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual de@@ af task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
that made it very good .
when they achieved a stable level of skill , we last in motor Cort@@ ex the manual motor@@ ized area .
then the monkeys was par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen at people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , exactly as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with plastic bra@@ ins . you can recover in a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recreation , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkey which recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
let us now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can freezing and use later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still being able to im@@ itate them in humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do that . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question of course is the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate , etc .
J@@ B : Yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and attempted permission to start the clinical studies , how many years does it take until someone may return to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to allow us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards it has to be applied to a multic@@ enter study .
one must truly re@@ prove that it is useful before being able to offer these treatment .
BG : and that &apos;s sure it is . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality but as inventory of our society .
we tend to see them as un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe that capitalism lead inev@@ it@@ ably to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his big night in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ less proven that it is quite possible to have a th@@ ri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programmes , which were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Chinese Communist Party , or some of my insur@@ rection , said that the democracy would be abol@@ ished , if anything would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economical model for real democracy .
I would like to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Chinese Communist Party , and even the Euro@@ group , we could save democracy , but we would need to save democracy but we need a tru@@ sty and bad democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are m@@ apped , our future , and our great , new technologies are shi@@ fted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this topic , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently cri@@ tically endanger@@ ed our taver@@ n .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few recognize his twin Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the se@@ e@@ worthy savings and corporations that could be anxi@@ ous where it would be productive and income could be able to carry out the Schul@@ den@@ berg and all the things could have been urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England , and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosper@@ ity of goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
a total of 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until reaching the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars , which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices .
thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which are not identical by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest heavily , such as Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who could not be true that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances certainly leads that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
that &apos;s my h@@ unter with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely wor@@ r@@ able art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , developing human talents , and especially to finance the technologies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for rescue the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the free and poor as majority control the government .
of course the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy completed many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , there would be an error to reduce the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these closures .
the decision @-@ making at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has occurred , and it was not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial , which gave them the right to political participation with the same vote in issues of state affairs .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long time --
like a candle , which light@@ ens very bright , it is burned rapidly .
however , our present liber@@ als have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the Gl@@ orious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and the economy is feasi@@ ble and the democratic process was seized , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone has been . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the separation of politics and the economy began , an in@@ her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two and the economy gradually deep@@ ened the policy and emp@@ tied them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are not so much like before ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is said that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics is ab@@ ander@@ ed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my h@@ unter with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kers , which nour@@ ished so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is therefore star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is increasing , the economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too fri@@ gh@@ tened , investing in cash of their companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the successful capitalism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy , the higher will be the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosper@@ ity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to put together the politics and the economy , and it would be better when in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Lin@@ ke had this idea just 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very strange .
the Te@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover only by a mi@@ racle as in ancient Athens , without new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there &apos;s a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing that he was working in low @-@ fle@@ ece working through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation the Twin Towers will be higher , the ag@@ gression , and social conflicts lower , as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must re@@ shape the economy and re@@ shape the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we can more democ@@ rati@@ fy the re@@ united area , otherwise we can see the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the question is not , whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements , which he has to survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ er@@ ical , similar to the &quot; Matrix &quot; which is dissolved , or by something , the company in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or a high @-@ tech @-@ version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what do it mean , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ rophy ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the company &apos;s area : please ask for a capital market before , where you work , and in which your capital is doing you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is ownership of those who work currently in the company .
then all the income from capital and from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who are part of the company , which are not working therein , and staff who work there , but not belong to which the company does not belong to those who do not hear more between capital and labor , and ultimately no temporary twin beds .
in the area of global political economy , please introduce themselves that our national currencies had a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire cos@@ mos is traded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country , in a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are rar .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that it wasn &apos;t the technical resources at that time .
today , we have , in particular , before the background of a re@@ united politics and the economy .
the world , which I describe you , is simultaneously prefer@@ enti@@ ally preferred , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ze , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ze .
but above all , it is a world where we can present a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we decline in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ rophy ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as Liber@@ t@@ bears Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not realize the technological development a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry Sum@@ mers are known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries , their interest in liberal democracy .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the West &apos;s perspective on China .
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our Liber@@ al Democ@@ ra@@ cies , we have the certificate of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on policy , while the field appears , where most of the economy is ab@@ rupt , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone is .
in certain respect , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today res@@ embles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- which is an error , historically significant .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , affecting the democratic development .
what you can watch in China now , res@@ embles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now able to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , ra@@ ging to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ap@@ ed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ying , and the constant den@@ ial of the Eurozone passed through the Eurozone , and continues to strengthen the development of the whole European Union mas@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on Greek pre@@ face -- by the way , the first sugges@@ tion was manifested to this den@@ ial --
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ y den@@ ying .
but you know what comes .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries an economic system , which is not life @-@ capable , through political will and Author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you might be able to delay a while , but if the change occurs , it expi@@ res ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive .
BG : what transformation do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s no doubt that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t have any future if we do not change its layout .
BG : did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest ...
if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a cl@@ amped situation , claims that he did not make mistakes , then it &apos;s a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest error was the application to extend the end of February to the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in the guide to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they only wanted to say to our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with bud@@ ger@@ ations , which ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to know that she led a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
nobody out of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who has imposed on this policy , and said , &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , they are demon@@ ically demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , when it appears , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price you &apos;ve never heard that though he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a big show and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this , shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any of Roy .
he must find shows , which are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are all right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that have ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after one has seen a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes wrong at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve , because I think you need particular intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes up more thoughts on the average draw , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are just amazing .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
printing is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
it needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents it online , where they can look for free .
and if Amazon have nothing to go out for nothing , is it right ?
millions of spectators watching these epis@@ odes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when looking at this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that all record everything .
you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ auses , which parts are over@@ looked after and watch it again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , and process the answer , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is only an average show -- as the average sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so somewhat over average , but not just what was done to Roy and his team .
about at the same time with another firm , another manager has pl@@ az@@ es a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he uses data for it , but it makes it something different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have seen the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews , which they give the shows , whose shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series on a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x got to hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 evaluation at this curve . so exactly there where they wanted to go .
of course this is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed .
you combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow means that this should work with everything .
if one coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision to meet , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optim@@ izes it by very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ est thing you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working , this is something terri@@ fying , because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
knows somebody here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in jail .
if anyone ask here in the US in prison and for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is eff@@ ected or not .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide if a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results , that &apos;s not knowing that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 Google announced that it is possible by data analysis fail@@ ures of flu , which cannot say -- through data analysis of Google @-@ research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a large message principle . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working ,
and no one could say why .
it was simply not working , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data were experienced , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes understand something .
despite all these f@@ aults , data will come into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should make sure that data are helpful .
even I know many trouble with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- a territory where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns concerning the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a result , you will cut this problem into its components , so you can analyse the individual parts in order to create a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assem@@ ble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable for setting up parts , and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this , and we all possess it all : our bra@@ ins .
if there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to better understand its audience , why they would not have been able to get all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which stood not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
by contrast , Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; Say us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think that things are push@@ ing if data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and it &apos;s not to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will get ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will break it later with a technical demo .
so far I met some decisions made in my life , whereby I should have list@@ ened to the ball in the night .
but , how to naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more exhau@@ sted , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . finally , it &apos;s to meet us to meet decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I think it as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
for the end , it is not the data , but the risks , which you meet at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
