<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he had spectacular, that the NSA has illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this article he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally announced plans for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know what the chapter is not right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has established against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the government of the government, whistleblower to condemn journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it's impossible to apply this right if mediums do not get this information, and if it cannot protect the identity of the muffness that they cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was troubled, he did something that many brave reporter did before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go in prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the end of 2007, Risen has lived with the risk to go in prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though she had existed for years, the demands of the government were incurably dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of counterfeiting and scrap to the statements, that also could do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were concerned, his telephone call,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its loan information, and even travel information with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and a suspicious source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much working as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security had the result of that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has always increased more possibilities to all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology the government allowed to renew rights of repo, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take it from the moment, in which they contact, rather than in the night, in the stuff.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet had his book, and it's considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source translation system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working with which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, as shown here by Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and saved on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't procure any more information secretly, and many of the information you would like to ask, would not be available from before.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments have always developing new spying technologies, which all endanger ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to ensure that not only technology-makers such as Edward Snowden have one way to apply Missing. it's just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the other environmental workers" "" "dispersed over abuse during the supply of soldiers. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint." "" "or a Wallstreet-insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crime, but to protect our constitutional law.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[April 3, 2016, [the] "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Mighty] [enormous money sums in tax havens have been hidden.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to a Declaration.] This Week, we were organised by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mospack Fonseca in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">Publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mospack Fonseca and say, "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the e-mails, exchange of messages, how the entire system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a breed of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad ravelled mailbox in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of US $2 billion will conduct Russian President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous on the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agency of an agency or John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems flawlessly removed from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concern us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide their wealth and wear -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always set it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another firm, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand, who behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult to understand criminal offences and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there were no prominent Americans that existed in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no sufficient Americans that trustain their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mospack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a backup of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to get a company to get a library of library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of schooling permitted to zoom out school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Bedding is allowed to zoom out particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">This kind of behavior, which affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at the Global Witness we wanted to find out how to see all this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a home investigator to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all until a lawyer may make suggestions for our investigators, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pretensions. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no emancipation took money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who made suggestions to our investigating investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leader, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It concerns how the system works, through corruption, control cursed, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to handle this, we must change the rules of rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trasingly, as if we could not do anything, if anything might ever have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as being born optimist, I see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen pressurges to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has collected in central registers on national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is leaving behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We really would like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind headsets.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say" "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end this way of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can end up the intransparency, which now allows this type of control cursed, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I had been kidnapped, and landed in the trunk with a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backpack.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy in the red Mazda remained and looked up my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me what he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He got the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows not the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I didn't know him yet! he says to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he is really planning, I don't want to have been kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Do you like?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night, I stayed in bed, I stared to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I rocked me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild ass in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sitting on the bed and shut down my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me, hangs today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there were a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can create it to transform fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've got over it. our apartment is going to stay for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi, and a desk, with a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-ham Omelett has completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we held our last guest at the castle and the door was pushed into the castle, then Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we can find new friends at the same time and have to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out how to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented our Investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the type of rooms, their doors are close when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay at them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would be light.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still quite near Trost, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwellings of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you think about the things that you can well. we could designen.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design lots of more than just look and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create through design immensely confidence, among people who never had previously made.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with Design Confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a tasting dress, which degree of confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your compass.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocking mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent begough by Panics, which you can now see -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel if they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing which is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors cannot only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel, if they lodge in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who now has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the position of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You've witnessed what kind of confidence we want to build. I'd like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been presented with his name; if he doesn't tell whence he comes, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 covers, which all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel, if you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did not make some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to spend the people, negatives distributions.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and host their assessments, before we set it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We tested a study with Stanford. we investigated how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how similar to the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising, we trust the people most that are most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social voreingenious.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything change.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation in common areas.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deep groves.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that confidence is dependent on how much one is reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you say too little, like "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">How much, for example, "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, e.g. "Great artwork in your home! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text. we also give tips to which themes should be writing a bit.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we didn't reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to settle this prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the relentless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times when not going smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed parties have been celebrated or homes devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I participated in customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront front, if confidence has broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than this calls. it's already hurt when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which is hears in the voice of the attack, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue improving us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence is working, miracle can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save the lives, even though they don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel it, they bring them into books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the Extra-Nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with monetary transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just to give it a "rental industry" but the thing is not righteous.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of itself, and that changes all.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, what would you be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be when in every place where you visited, a group there would be waiting to wait a thoroughly and one at a pub-our neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from reason to interconnecting?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be, if cities would be shared by the common thought?</seg>
<seg id="238">I make cities before, which allow us to make society and relations, instead of solitude and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, Seoul has already begun this project. lots of parking spaces, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Among those people were offered, students that were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated on humans and their children had gone out. Incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">"" "" "" "to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, over our platform alone will be 785" "" "000 people in 191 countries will host a stranger with strangers or themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality had already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noted that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome, deepening prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda pass by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, undertaking a brain underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would no Muslims know.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their huber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee maker -- twice espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtower-Fitness-fanatia,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sing, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as an homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were entangled:" "" "why do you oppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusve was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as a 17-year-old felt to adapt a perfect and untouchable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not just assume the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I started with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read him, thought after, proved in question, dubious and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of Rhythmik brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself for myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that somebody takes you to perceive you completely, and yet loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started as all the Egyptian Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember, where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, in late breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eilan".</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people donate from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard it:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "jihad..."..., "Bomb Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed the works of others from a citizen into suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how we drove me -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Seid carefully," "Aries in well-lighted areas." "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering together.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings, "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The emotions were understandably filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people who was born to Muslims in the Free University.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branding suggestions on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I've witnessed the guards of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain through ongoing itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing about questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can indeed hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my municipality like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: one malicious tumor is removed as a whole or a benign tumour just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, assistants and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be some parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque causes people to consider any other faith tolerant, and bigger citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"" "" "" "and as a head of the police in the Washington area, D.C." "" ": people actually won't be radical in mosques." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellars or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radical process, it has found that it begins online. as a result the person of its church can be cut, even by their family, that the person believes that terrorists are abhors the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radialisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of how the IS reach their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups assert their ideology reasons on their" "" "Holy Book." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throws a look at them, they do not say what they" "" "lasen in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It's their brutality, which they can see these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me an astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they are more upset to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him to have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom they had spoken, she brought her wrath to silence in the world, they would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing, inspired and something that had given to her rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who had a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam presented the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blame them for their rage, he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">As I learned in the mosque, they kept it before the IS to close.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia hits me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day rely on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you submit reviews messages in which negative about Muslims was reported, they voted for military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It actually may be a tool to manipulate the public to compensate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel as the first, but the toxic air of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="368">In reference to collective innocence, it is not just about to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived at Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Faculty of Medicine, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me, that he was the most adorable and most generous person who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her CV. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is my brotherhood, such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had posted on the afternoon as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discuss it and for us it was no slight decision because it was that we would leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one, in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">Our son in the nursery we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, and went into the prayer of prayer, and what I saw, he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the imam got a announcement, beware and welcomed our guests, because the half of the people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion, panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on # Safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than those who are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a minv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what say you think that you may claim a TEDTalk, a thought with deep monuments, i.e. one exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, fool you not. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I'm no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usual, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When people look at the Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want labour, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans appear usually, the rule is usually broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, shortly before, to become a lifelong business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for industrial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcels in our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines at FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting you reach high speed and acceleration in narrowing area.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-controlled structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence, and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it has to know collective radiation where mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects in order to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, set calculations on board that should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest point. e.g., "start" and "landing."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine, tried to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other strong gliders, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">"" "" "" "in contrast to most of the starwings it can die, and thus has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile." ""</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane doesn't matter to achieve optimal position and improves performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with thousands of moving parts, which are mirrored to brewing you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, the pilot-controlled pilot devices could fly, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinternal, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and Querruder, no other rotating drive or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life has very much, making it stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm in the stern-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to take it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood that it is really right now, is small, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monster is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is the ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">He receives the great skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller-aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a little push -- a motor or propeller falls from, the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We recorded commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as dring would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is salary in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in so spectacular manner.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bag pointed out on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolve each other in a very far distant galaxy. they turned three boreholes in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they illuminated brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">They put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We eventually speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time tissue, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multicoldy life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has revealed a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly cute -- Rai Weiss decided by the MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genies, that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much harder work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometer- gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO has increased significantly, which significantly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO has started to clarify several smaller, hard-stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collizing black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than these:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my token father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life were basically.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he studied gravitational waves of black solves and her by observatory like LIGO. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a boost in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the pass of the shaft the room and its entire content will be stretched out into one direction and cook in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in csen on the theory of relativity often a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretches and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched out and stopped by us. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros according to the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the LIGO employees declared to be crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be exactly measured than a thousandths of a nuclear power. this is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are darily and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO be more one ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things about us: facial expressions, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by allowing you to perceive the light of several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that are especially important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we can listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and level, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can make no simple pictures of objects in all applications.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are at the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert the wave pattern in sound, we can listen to all the literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to laugh, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, wherewith my colleague Scott has already been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, it sounds the same circulation with an additional tone change. it sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement worchanger, highlighted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - hear LIGO following: [surrender noise] Jolia, knows this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as quickly as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we're just considering us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most common body in all, one with a mass of 29 sons, the other with a mass of 36 sun, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It consists of the sustained meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massert stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the thrilling physical processes occur in the core, which is behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see that these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, when it would be transparent glass. the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine will be covered by his own oblight.</seg>
<seg id="541">By using gravitational waves, it should be possible to recover until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see, and of which we have never seen. things that we can only discover when we hear.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the same in the first attempt of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the type of stars that were observed in black holes such as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are soften the suction notions for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to view a completely different point of view on the events of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be beautiful, as the jungle to laugh himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say about all" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, I brought me in unpleasant situations I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I like to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to begin with the Schauspiel?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: precisely that to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talking, my social anxiety -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life to an unexpectedly. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls out of unexplained reasons, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"notes, I need milk for my sails."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them once if I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there I swollen me to play with them as soon as you can take me. no matter what I'm doing, or where to go, I say always Yes -- each individual time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it has also been an amazing side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" means to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create hard TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for contributing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV-programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme provides hundreds of jobs, which previously not existed.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a televisions can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three shows that simultaneously are four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created itself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to assemble my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why am I a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you that work so hard, if you're doing a company, a country or a class room, make sure you understand that I don't just say on the computer, so that I say: I don't understand that it goes on a dream job not to dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I placed troops, I painted them on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">Thus one can make a high tone, cast a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanised and intoxicating, funny and distracting, clinically and maternal, grasped and sensible. it is the best of it.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sum sounds like a lively street, I could always go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take away if I declare the sums that I write to them that the writing is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with television when I started to work and work, to create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summon is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you cannot be different than any size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike any size, regardless of size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of his failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for failure, and I don't know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to tell you only, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I will, ever more persisted limits, the more space, the more work simultaneously, the more things simultaneously, the more things simultaneously, the more things I write history, more than I write history, renew more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, overdrives.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "I would like to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing to delegate, a Titan sleeps not, with all your hearts, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when doing what is doing, the work that you love, suddenly do?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some might think:" "" "Heule dich" "", "the author of the author Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you're doing, you're doing, you're working to be a teacher that doesn't like to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sums, if the sums stops already when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song sound of my heart, can I survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-States-waitch" constitutes a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am going out on the way to the outside, and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to say and secondly, she called me no. "</seg>
<seg id="675">They don't call anybody else. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I'm crush it when I got Titan bin and my sums become more rough, and here everything change my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">That's nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read out dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness, and lack of Sumerizing, can't make anything except fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything which exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, juniors and song, in which it's watchful, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere, peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy stroke comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly because, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who, if I tell you, who am I'm writing by means of programmes and television hours and how to work my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river which comes from life-lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums are ignored the printing of history that are used to do the work, anticipation and print.</seg>
<seg id="713">Genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The genuine sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to me the false words, for which God said to me, that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for a fixed rule, so I can release myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish, it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play not on me as well as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man is better to work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Now, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too excited, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We turn around and back in the garden, and back, and her.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Yet I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacker my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe satisfies me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play till I ask myself: why did we ever hear with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! say it always Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll hold me for naiv, for a daytime instructor.</seg>
<seg id="742">Since you're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones would like to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they do not want to make something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladyday or biscuit will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaking my teenager-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes more need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even on a toe-wune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that make the children ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it applies to feel the sums of peace, a place for his peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not going to play with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" generally.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm shatter and I siege. friends meet, books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "is just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece, why do not treat yourself to 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums appears to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works don't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months then opens a door to the energy flow. I hear me into my office. I hear me into new ideas. I use it in full moves and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like those sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not I... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my sums now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's going to tell me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the grip. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the Summon. the land, which I run, the marathon, whom I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the rest, the other, the right sums: the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more power makes this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know that I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think of things I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamboomerate.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I'm Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">It is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That's probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical surgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, the tried to improve nerve function by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have one of the most well-known, the "Lowenhirnstimulation," which implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgegen is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior manager and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-Hirn-Traumata the brain is swelling and the cranial pressure is stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the lives, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It sometimes needs to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen cerebral mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a slight task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from one tissue grows to grow comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments where they can flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly that we had to make with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a family cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biologo-Lessons that stem cells are unmature cells that can turn into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain tissue in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells continue differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They came slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like family cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellant cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear but clearly -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brains.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells so as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then marker in colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted it at the entrance of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologian transplantation -- car transcoding.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimitate this cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in foamed brainstances?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routes we could work with wise monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained. they rose to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these little points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not cease.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual deaf task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable level of skill, we last in motor Cortex the manual motorized area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys was paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at people, they recovered spontaneously up to some degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with plastic brains. you can recover in a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recreation, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkey which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Let us now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freezing and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still being able to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"" "" "" "I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of course is the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and attempted permission to start the clinical studies, how many years does it take until someone may return to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards it has to be applied to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must truly reprove that it is useful before being able to offer these treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure it is. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant which is in reality but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to see them as unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism lead inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big night in Beijing have doubtless proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programmes, which were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Chinese Communist Party, or some of my insurrection, said that the democracy would be abolished, if anything would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I would like to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party, and even the Eurogroup, we could save democracy, but we would need to save democracy but we need a trusty and bad democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies are mapped, our future, and our great, new technologies are shifted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">In this topic, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction, which currently critically endangered our tavern.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the schooldenberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the seeworthy savings and corporations that could be anxious where it would be productive and income could be able to carry out the Schuldenberg and all the things could have been urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England, and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">A total of 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until reaching the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars, which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit which are not identical by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest heavily, such as Ödipus father, who could not be true that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances certainly leads that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That's my hunter with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "its extremely worrable art. all the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, developing human talents, and especially to finance the technologies" "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for rescue the Earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the free and poor as majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the Athenian democracy completed many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be an error to reduce the importance of the Athenic democracy due to these closures.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making at the Athenian democracy has occurred, and it was not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial, which gave them the right to political participation with the same vote in issues of state affairs.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lightens very bright, it is burned rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberals have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling classes.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and the economy is feasible and the democratic process was seized, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone has been." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our current democracies, since the separation of politics and the economy began, an inhereditary struggle between the two and the economy gradually deepened the policy and emptied them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are not so much like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is said that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics is abandered and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hunter with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of smokers, which nourished so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that it is therefore starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that is so far cannibalized by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is increasing, the economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened, investing in cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "" "" "according to the successful capitalism," "" "demos" "" "[the people] of democracy, the higher will be the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to put together the politics and the economy, and it would be better when in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea just 100 years ago and it wasn't very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The Teakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover only by a miracle as in ancient Athens, without new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there's a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing that he was working in low-fleece working through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation the Twin Towers will be higher, the aggression, and social conflicts lower, as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must reshape the economy and reshape the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we can more democratify the reunited area, otherwise we can see the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is not, whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he has to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dysterical, similar to the "Matrix" which is dissolved, or by something, the company in "Star Trek," or a high-tech-version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what do it mean, how could it look like this "star Trek" -such utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: please ask for a capital market before, where you work, and in which your capital is doing you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is ownership of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the income from capital and from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who are part of the company, which are not working therein, and staff who work there, but not belong to which the company does not belong to those who do not hear more between capital and labor, and ultimately no temporary twin beds.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please introduce themselves that our national currencies had a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire cosmos is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country, in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it wasn't the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have, in particular, before the background of a reunited politics and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you, is simultaneously preferentially preferred, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesize, global keynesize.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can present a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we decline in a "matrix" - similar dystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as Libertbears Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for reunification of politics and the economy is..." "" "we do not realize the technological development a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry Summers are known as" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries, their interest in liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the West's perspective on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there's a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our Liberal Democracies, we have the certificate of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on policy, while the field appears, where most of the economy is abrupt, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic-free zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respect, if I may say the so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- which is an error, historically significant.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, affecting the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China now, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now able to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, raging to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I aped that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye to the self-complying, and the constant denial of the Eurozone passed through the Eurozone, and continues to strengthen the development of the whole European Union massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on Greek preface -- by the way, the first suggestion was manifested to this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny denying.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries an economic system, which is not life-capable, through political will and Authoritarianism, you might be able to delay a while, but if the change occurs, it expires abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what transformation do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there's no doubt that the Eurozone doesn't have any future if we do not change its layout.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, particularly in such a clamped situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then it's a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was the application to extend the end of February to the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in the guide to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to say to our government, just because they didn't want to deal with budgerations, which ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to know that she led a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">Nobody out of the Troika's Troika, who has imposed on this policy, and said, "This was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite a pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone doesn't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, they are demonically demonically and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose the way of a post-modern 1930, when it appears, it will also be tolerable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price you've never heard that though he is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a big show and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this, shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any of Roy.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are all right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that have addictive, where, after one has seen a season, your brain asks, "Where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what goes wrong at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve, because I think you need particular intelligence to undertake "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes up more thoughts on the average draw, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Printing is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price does not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents it online, where they can look for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon have nothing to go out for nothing, is it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when looking at this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that all record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show when you pauses, which parts are overlooked after and watch it again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, and process the answer, and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House" but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- as the average sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so somewhat over average, but not just what was done to Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another firm, another manager has plazes a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super-show and he uses data for it, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have seen the existing data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews, which they give the shows, whose shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series on a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix got to hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9,1 evaluation at this curve. so exactly there where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course this is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">You combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision to meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeest thing you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, this is something terrifying, because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows somebody here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone ask here in the US in prison and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is effected or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide if a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results, that's not knowing that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that it is possible by data analysis failures of flu, which cannot say -- through data analysis of Google-research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a large message principle. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly wasn't working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was simply not working, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data were experienced, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these faults, data will come into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Even I know many trouble with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a territory where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns concerning the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you will cut this problem into its components, so you can analyse the individual parts in order to create a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable for setting up parts, and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this, and we all possess it all: our brains.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand its audience, why they would not have been able to get all of these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards," which stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">By contrast, Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas as they voted "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say, "Say us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think that things are pushing if data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and it's not to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will get...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "- here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will break it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions made in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, how to naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more exhausted, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is klüger and klüger. finally, it's to meet us to meet decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think it as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For the end, it is not the data, but the risks, which you meet at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
