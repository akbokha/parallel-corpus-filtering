Munich 1856 : four cards change your views over the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should face up today .
a sal@@ ft@@ en@@ kap@@ elle , where it is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers produce the single @-@ sti@@ p@@ tive reason of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ t , if land cards are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
it knows everyone who had to set itself already because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a circum@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the Digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but therefore very al@@ er@@ able .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one knows as such as such .
in a large picture map for cities and municipalities , detailed maps were incorporated , so called the Pri@@ pos@@ al leaves .
these were originated according to the Bavarian Surv@@ ey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 and re @-@ jump of the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French Armed Forces since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave up a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course on military purposes .
even if the French troops inv@@ aded the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern @-@ Card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Pri@@ mary School of Munich dates back to 1856 and is how many others can be found on the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper &apos;s website .
the comparison early / today is the most impressive thing in the country &apos;s capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ mitting , which occurs in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after creating the map , in 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , the send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of shelter focus on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße that was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance : in writing a small @-@ piece map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ ge , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
small plots there are no farmers here today - but small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 Hall of the Ok@@ tober@@ fest , had actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the framework of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , you won &apos;t just read the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the gast@@ ric dough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the lie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road , one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ene Institution &quot; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders .
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the facility - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for instance the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he is illegal to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients first place was first , later on 500 places was expanded .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circulation system in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um , the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training .
located west of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of the buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built in architectural reference to the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ al Institute , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &apos; name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
in December 1944 , the bom@@ bs made many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a sal@@ mon chapel from the Middle Ages , stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day will take place and take place on 5 April 2017 at the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
compare the old Munich @-@ card with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
the National Association for Pro@@ mot@@ ing Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people , travelling to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks in the State of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican trav@@ ellers , visitors and missions , as a number of frag@@ ment@@ ing , ra@@ ins @-@ based incid@@ ents occur in the entire state in the whole country , called it in the position of the Group .
a recently approved law of Missouri which makes it difficult to gain a discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utor authorities of the State , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate on minorities , the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have injury to citizenship rights , human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be stopped due to their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such frequency , which we have not heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning , which has issued the Organisation for a State in the USA .
the group cited incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist convic@@ tions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline in custody during the journey through the state , and having taken by the police of Missouri in custody , without having a crime of crime .
the Council also has shown a recent report of the Office of Missouri &apos;s Office of Missouri , shown in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that humans are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring it to the money , or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , in 2015 , in 2015 , 100 hate crimes , according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ elt , the FB@@ I , the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would be difficult to en@@ force a company because of residence or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , who under@@ take the immigration authorities to compens@@ ate people because of immigration laws , which will contribute to further education .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other countries , but in recent days , stakeholders have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
past@@ or project is el@@ ement@@ ar
the Fisch@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag named Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on the spot .
representatives of the tra@@ ys department of the family Schwen@@ demann gathered themselves together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially granted insight into his operation in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy c@@ ows and equally young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an alternative commerci@@ alization course for the milk of its c@@ ows , so pi@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regional trains are exclusively located on the table of the Feri@@ heg@@ y .
as he also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ ach , he described the turn@@ out project as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar . &quot;
I can not produce sol@@ ving surfaces on such areas .
the green space for a lot of work , much must be processed with the sense sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he acquired the el@@ ap@@ al operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality has recognized the significance of the de@@ cent project and is happy about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers must be supported .
one hope that the o@@ vers@@ ing of the faces could still be drawn up with all the rop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and move on how to continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often present in criticism
a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013 .
the maintenance of the open area is about 40 hectares , which must not be stopped until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half a leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers stay for 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and landing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scapes of Baden @-@ Württemberg ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the government to promote femin@@ ism .
the aim is to open the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
a prerequis@@ ite is the presence of a promot@@ er of the L@@ PR .
in addition , the fenced area should not be infl@@ ated ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by pressing .
currently the application of eight people with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence at 16 kilometres , is currently underway .
the maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it if they start to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate these equally as each other - therefore the sor@@ rows staged by Saddam Hussein &apos;s sec@@ lu@@ sion in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he had a symbolic act with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals to dras@@ tic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue yourself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ asting and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have caught him when he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to , when the celebrated po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta cont@@ ended : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which ligh@@ tened the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to you , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively true , but as he himself formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is a contemporary reson@@ ance on the tou@@ ching words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your labor , your poor , / thy bed@@ ri@@ dden masses , who be@@ fore@@ see to bre@@ athe freely , / the afflicted rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coast@@ lines . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ap@@ t waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who had to place their words after their death - knew very well that they had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show links between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , in which they exhibited the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em , the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the association with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a dis@@ ast@@ rous attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and precisely how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing .
the Great D@@ ih@@ as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conservative daily that bring the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding .
it shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fli@@ ck@@ el should not shine the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather un@@ usually , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is cast here slightly .
the importance of statue is quite and simply a question of perception of perception .
the great ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ ev@@ ant of Lazarus existed in them to see them as it was seen from the exhau@@ sting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often hor@@ ri@@ ble travel on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome which they must hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective of recogni@@ zing Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but the ass , the only source of power is ad@@ orable .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish Members of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two fle@@ ets belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the executive director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ year Scottish cont@@ ingent of Scottish cont@@ ingent of a massive contribution to the team will be aff@@ ord &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland &apos;s something special , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand , and we will continue to find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics : it &apos;s something to do with what they did .
and also with the type of road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler , who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team as team member .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
her capit@@ als speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or where ever they live or train , went out of space and felt very motivated .
the passion and true sense of course , the E@@ ili@@ dh naturally brought , were terri@@ fic . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , which becomes the fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 sho@@ ots in the British squ@@ ad are .
the total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ range for@@ erunner Mu@@ ir leads on this way and has placed five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m L@@ äu@@ fen .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who is 1,500 m , is another sh@@ al@@ ot that you should be watching the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of their first world championships as the only other sh@@ al@@ lot in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ er capitalist states says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their farmers will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is so special to be a team &apos;s capit@@ als that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour but to know that my team mate for me have voted and chose me something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the ch@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Po@@ dien .
what is related to my speech as a capitalist ?
yes , I think it was good .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete to compete and it will be just like a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking your Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office when you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of v@@ oters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for all , from the Domestic Policy to its political principles .
he nar@@ row@@ ed with criticism , safe .
but He has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and silent , as sheep led to slaugh@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland in Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans have blo@@ cked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union imp@@ acted it so at the beginning of this week .
the governor of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ action with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the highest ranking of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary Hit@@ z@@ kopf .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his v@@ oters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
the blocking of those who come on the side of the governor , which is officially referred to as the official forum , is officially referred to and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse has argu@@ ed the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing further than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ les or Sp@@ inal @-@ filled people who force the pas@@ sports .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blo@@ cked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
Law@@ yer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water , but she asked to hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t miss this idea when a number of people on the same subject matter , then they will be dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the members of the governor act as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Für@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to as@@ sign a message by simply blocking a critics or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times , if you have had the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn ators , and to silence .
but it just happened digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises that he has imp@@ lic@@ ated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users , which were blo@@ cked by his Twitter feeds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County will last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when she named a v@@ oters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers per@@ sever@@ ed between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous respon@@ sive to his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tioning that were collected his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med up his position , according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of expression , opinion of opinion and courses belong to our nation &apos;s basis .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hop@@ ing for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club held in East Lothar , the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the last year by side to the end of the Arch@@ er@@ field , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament sp@@ ies in the name of the founding of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state .
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship , although he won both the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels particularly at , &quot; said that the player , in South@@ port , said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura open , since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on the hom@@ etown .
this event will be the first Scottish presence since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a little more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it to play , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how it has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades less humans have died for passive smoking in lung cancer .
as a result , scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) occur in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer have been attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; Head of Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he went into his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer for pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .

house connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; reas@@ on@@ ably restored in the time , &quot; says the head of the builder Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation may be complicated , as in the sub@@ strate a lot of ver@@ tices , which should not be noted in the plans .
traffic , which has always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers before red lights and un@@ locking is enorm@@ ously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it does not use stove .
they even use only rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ peaceful Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - direct in the fireplace .

of course too late can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there is the soldier here .
&quot; nobody w@@ eth it after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former d@@ utch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 was supposed to vote against the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which touched the independence against the Dutch rule , turned back to the government of Jakarta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or ad@@ missions .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea were involved in the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated such as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a 5 @-@ hour car ride with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bo@@ o w@@ ns , and from corrugated roo@@ fs that were converted by r@@ ust into various gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few In@@ don@@ esians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .

&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the most p@@ oo@@ rest province where 28 % of people living under poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort valued at $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has char@@ coal Resource resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that in@@ don@@ esi@@ ens are preser@@ ving a sti@@ cky presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort has paid local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars .
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims based upon major autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and will be dealt mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands of thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
Mass@@ u@@ as &apos;s ancest@@ ry in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s gene@@ alog@@ y in the 1970 @-@ 1990s were forced to commit genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report given by the arch@@ di@@ ocese of Brisbane from 2016 , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - ra@@ pe and ra@@ inf@@ all are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia &apos;s researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .

the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Folk and Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ ing@@ ement of the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - along the way towards the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel dec@@ eived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i for 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that righteousness is re@@ produced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the children &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ tened children spoke to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took attack@@ ing their tone , and returned later with four soldiers , as the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , did they beat the group with their ge@@ en@@ forcement , spoke sacrifice and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers hum@@ bled in the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was beaten so bad@@ ly that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to request justice .
they contributed zer@@ em@@ oni@@ elle fighters and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird wat@@ ering - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to ligh@@ ten stones on police and military out@@ posts .
when the s@@ enti@@ ment was heated , the soldiers was sent a command on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses was more than three times , they shoot down dead , &quot; says it is not released in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the danger of danger and called upon peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned to my left hand , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows not yet , who has fired , but says that the ball come from the rows of here assembled .
&quot; it was over@@ crow@@ ded , many shots were fired . &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was done three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran@@ ged to him , and sought his body to make sure it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who &apos;s how many Indonesian care carries a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the che@@ er@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said rep@@ lic@@ ates that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people think to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ ph@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for families of victims and pregnant women in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be solved immediately , so that in the future it is no longer going to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism for laying of historic human rights violations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most violations are occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jakarta by TIM@@ E , and said he had no plans to establish an appeal mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is controlled by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , whom the UN counts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ judi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims &apos; families were contrary to this alleg@@ ations with unbelie@@ ving unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the Military , I have afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that humans have in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the Military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
regulated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had cast stones on officers , who re@@ acted by warning dam@@ s .
but loc@@ als say that the Mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary Police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it &apos;s ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was living near the hospital , as soon as the final has been delivered quickly , such as the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to withdraw the participating officers to withdraw from the territory and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the Police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a serious producer for the Indonesian government .
lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the reb@@ ate army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , bringing them spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the last years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was arrested and arbit@@ rary in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot;
they never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just as well .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf nozzle .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
throughout the period , economic ine@@ qualities grow between the local Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rant , which had arrived in large numbers since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually come to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to conduct their own company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , President of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ cham@@ p was deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given for fil@@ ming .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy @-@ owned Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the Pro@@ mises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to adopt the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists trying to report by In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens un@@ quiet provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : Visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure to the Indonesian government remains restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands - the United Nations Human Rights Council affecting the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically seen O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights fail@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who want to know that more foreign governments should take this knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke and troubled him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a source that participated in the session but anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably won &apos;t be voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but is involved in the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ iss@@ ing , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people does not know that there is under the constant threat of the pre@@ dat@@ ory military , in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other pap@@ ua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ ings of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ers , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ers caused a last symbolic act , which was buried on a complex opposite the police and military station .
they don &apos;t know that any justice will never perish , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with joint head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire Coll@@ ect the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ ken@@ nel from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residence in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire which is inspired by the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is called by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we slept with fire alarm and scre@@ aming of the people .
we spent the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down@@ ward , &quot; counted a resident who told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 AM GMT ) destroyed the fire and cooling the building .
the government said that it works on the provision of accomod@@ ations for those concerned .
the incident can be used for security of materials that are used in external areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or isolation , came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding of the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June was said to have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen to the General Assembly with its large Davis Cup coup .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single was responsible for this sport revolutionary sugges@@ tion , Davis Cup single only on two winning kits , that does not support two @-@ thir@@ ds majority by the required two @-@ thir@@ ds majority .
the times often very long , but also very well @-@ estimated five @-@ sentence classic will be preserved to the traditional way .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nation@@ alities have not accepted the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many claims , the proposal had come to explo@@ it the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host right in the following round .
in order to reduce the costs for organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated on training places , etc. and players will be receiving less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US Travel@@ ers brings forbidden objects to the plane , a survey found out
a survey among passengers must be aware that more than 20 percent are aware or deliber@@ ately forbidden objects on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which bet@@ ting the plane , while in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had to be delayed that they have traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers have to consider the rules .
from the respon@@ d@@ ents agreed that they have wis@@ ely tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with fewer than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were banned .
the most common items listed on T@@ SA agents were deliber@@ ately diagnosed with foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent reported to have expressed objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female survey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ d@@ ents also confirmed that they had forbidden banned drugs to the plane .
the company said it asks trav@@ ellers in all the country to find out how many accid@@ entally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed sm@@ ug@@ ware was brought through the airport security and how many things had done clearly .
it is no surprise that people who sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are - wis@@ ingly or unkn@@ ow@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
the company however indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
humans are often un@@ safe , which liquids may take away or how much of them are .
so , no surprise that the largest amount of objects forbidden by the T@@ SA is forbidden to liquids .
for a period of time , the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gling ware .
liquids can be allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ customers Cancel
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ gone so far , that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their obligation @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers of sales , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k reached another , less glorious figure for the first time : the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car over the past few months .
now Mus@@ k dre@@ amed : from the total 5@@ 18@@ .000 pre @-@ orders have been re@@ trac@@ ted back 63@@ .000 .
critics had always asser@@ ted that it is only for binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the US $ 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made before , Mus@@ k was held at a telephone conference with analysts .
so that the cancellation of up to about twelve percent of all orders could be problem , however , the Tesla head does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
over the past year Tesla had delivered 84@@ ,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it will be combined - all models combined - 500,000 will be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , when Tesla it manages to drive his n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested production roads with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that it is possible .
but it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the unc@@ le@@ ability of reservations can become a problem for Tesla .
because then , the company can not hin@@ der the company without satisfied customers .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to emissions of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being betra@@ yed out of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented his shift as its agency to the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ ac@@ tion@@ less than previous administ@@ rations .
he didn &apos;t mention the complaint against his previous post in a Federal Labour Court .
it goes around a period that ran on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of o@@ zone o@@ zone in 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to delay the observ@@ ance of a year to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid the economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ suffered repeatedly to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the su@@ dden conversion from Wednesday is the youngest judicial set@@ back to the P@@ ru@@ eck regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Labour Court in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded its authority to delay the implementation of a Obama administration , oil and gas companies to reduce waste ch@@ equ@@ es , to delay .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ suffered suggested that his turn @-@ turn in o@@ zone standards just simply beat the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states by the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administ@@ rations , the EPA has often kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and maintained by activists , and in an agreement to determine the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t believe in regulation of jurisdiction , and we take the dead@@ lines seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority who gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA , that P@@ ru@@ suffered some@@ time his &quot; authorization to delay and all other legally available authority to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in congress are push@@ ing to a more comprehensive new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill in the last month approved the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet completed in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states promised the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our k@@ itt@@ ens - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6,7 million Americans that are affected by over 115 million Americans that flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources will react to sunlight .
the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems with sensitive groups of human problems and contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and environmental prot@@ ector che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ eck surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ dig@@ nant , how much pressure does it take to in@@ hale this sensible step by the responsible protection of the air that we bre@@ athe in@@ hale , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological cross@@ roads of the Tr@@ ump government , to fight pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock on a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius @-@ plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and convey@@ ors on their concerns .
Walter Martini emphasi@@ zed : &quot; it is a unique desert . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wür@@ tt@@ stein ur@@ ian document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the mountain with the present parish church of Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the wording of the document on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , a grand courtyard , which belonged to the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht , and not vice vers@@ a .
so there people lived there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ lements of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 post@@ ulate this historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was created from the early medieval own church .
a Lord who built a church , prepared and remained with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and was also able to inherit these pec@@ uli@@ arities .
this means that the right to use a past@@ or or to the bishop of a new past@@ or .
three altars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two breaks at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell stand for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but was later to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the window discs were wrapped up and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
in 1796 French forces encamped in the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as a burning wood .
the remains of the church threatened by 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hel@@ arius @-@ Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schw@@ eiler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche collap@@ sed .
only the church tower was standing .
in the new year 1834 , a storm split the bell tower and half a storm .
to prevent evil , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em has to care of the &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er &apos;s retired &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .

Association wants to check out approval of win@@ ders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal prerequis@@ ite for the construction , and therefore has shi@@ fted to the land@@ boards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked the permission for the creation of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful for you .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration camp existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but the concentration zone also causes a exclusion of wind power util@@ isation for the rest of urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided by a change in the Flemish concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - but the district government had not approved the Düsseldorf District Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is due to un@@ lawful and there@@ for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , president of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette in front of the summer break ; an approval of the District Government is still available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the issu@@ ance of approval of wind turbines will be legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of admission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective writing has entered into the district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vier@@ sen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes you to review the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the administrative court at the administrative court , the circle would not want to lead itself to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette area , the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines .
in the past year , the company was involved in which the City of Vier@@ sen participates in central contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by approximately 11 400 households , which corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , four @-@ day city council issued a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district of Hein@@ sberg .

according to police data a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch sailed with their passenger cars as an accompanying person who accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region to explore the shopping in the city centre in September .
the trade association and the city authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the Ch@@ air@@ person of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend , the customers will sensitive to sensi@@ ti@@ ze which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket product range .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
furthermore , local companies should present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre for &quot; mit@@ ter@@ am @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; is to be loaded .
these destinations are not only the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots are on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that pass through the Ak@@ tions weekend so Christian König .
the Municipality and Trade Association are co@@ operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
this means the industrial verein and the city into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers , as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with sold @-@ on Sunday , talks with all commercial engineers and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the shipment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be new or re @-@ opened .
these include courses and tourists .
but many loc@@ als would have lost the inner city downtown shopping .
at the end , all of them would contribute to revi@@ ve the city &apos;s city - up to land@@ lords , all the city and associations .
it led to overcome the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ ie network that had taken part , had said King in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in M@@ ühl@@ hausen , shared with the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , taking part in five Thuring@@ ian cities .
beside Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .

Tr@@ ump put after continuous tran@@ scription of telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts by phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on the 27th of January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto to hear , publicly said that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President ruled him because he had publicly traded on the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This may not tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and pregnant , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ gles were also published and revealed a hin@@ dered exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. turn@@ out that a trade for the US refugees to take on &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; du@@ mm , &quot; that would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and broke out on the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge was able to gli@@ de a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man @-@ middle age in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside the occup@@ ants suspended the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want to know this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; qu@@ arri@@ ed the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
sh@@ out , silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was torn .
fortunately , this hor@@ ri@@ ble scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a ch@@ lings on the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience strug@@ gl@@ ed from the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Citi@@ zenship has come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to re@@ im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted for murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all those years no one person was arrested - even though we know them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organization &apos;s organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a reproach on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of State Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the reproduction as a dramatic call to action , represents an annual memory of the Monroe community , that an un@@ righteous has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want punishment , we want to work , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not reach healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of jurisdiction lays down a du@@ b@@ bed on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding communities were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remains on free foot , Citi@@ zens says that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : policies and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice released the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in place their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice of FB@@ I of the FB@@ I , the black colour gu@@ ards Roger Mal@@ com moved a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while fighting - allegedly on a woman .
Bro@@ oks said , the rum@@ or of the city was that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby was born , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , donated 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , thus the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she turned away from prison , Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge was approaching , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it asks , it was Har@@ rison who prepared the mor@@ row and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy between the state and local criminal prosecution that wasn &apos;t only involved in Mor@@ den , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a elect@@ oral &quot; massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene managed the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is vivi@@ dly , comprehen@@ sible and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene told that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with his appeti@@ te in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen , or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and wait as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview about the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ase co @-@ director .
he played the role of the Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ es since years , but he said that the role will never be sim@@ pler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story about life because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , playing Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece k@@ icks off with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester , and troubled him that he had slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ ches the fire .
there is a break .
and then every ( at least all the black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the pon@@ ds .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performer .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona does the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repeti@@ tion ends violent and fast .
there &apos;s scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman dressed with a wedding dress , stands out about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads trillion holidays trau@@ mas Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred yards away , there is a group of about four dozen viewers swe@@ at and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the road .
they experienced all almost eight hours of Georgia whilst Bro@@ oks they lead them on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the Mor@@ de has remained an ec@@ ec@@ ote , but now , when one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels pen@@ sive .
if the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ecting the dead name .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , sign the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy when he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ eil and wi@@ pe their t@@ ears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw re@@ ar@@ ed Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona gir@@ ded two of his opponents and then cr@@ ying out in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers in one of women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this from a reason . &quot;
later the audience is push@@ ing together with the actors .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ded a white pair of Atlanta , excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they &apos;ve just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words that feeling the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear this terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and doing that , because they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it do with me , I can believe that the Lyn@@ n will still continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today she called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police @-@ shooting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks courtyard in his table , he e@@ at@@ eth and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said that he began to start the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we carry , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like that we can learn from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own story , who knows his own story , is convicted to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself first on stage - in view of the large heat again in Leg@@ als .
with tension , the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team was expected .
in 2013 , he had to leave the Pfei@@ f@@ Concert in 2013 over themselves , there were five years later , in which the cat@@ ar@@ ed &quot; Bu@@ eh . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the dp@@ a performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not just made a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of which vision has grown .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max lot works as volunteers
they work in their volunteers for several sites .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture stock , once in the week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
how are your experiences there@@ with ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with adolescents , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late volunteers .
how does that come ?
quantity : I made high school .
and then a civil engineering , we say we were successful .
I knew that it is something wrong for me and I want to make something different to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , since there is a gli@@ mp@@ se because you can see how it is on site , perhaps even , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I will study con@@ current , and will probably take a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different uses during volunteers ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to it , where one can make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth welfare - in all possible fac@@ tions of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that has got me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
An@@ other than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , it isn &apos;t that because we expect to expect stun@@ t .
one has always gone other people again , each of which have a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - you must always go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch @-@ anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range which gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so that &apos;s life .

EPA returns decision for del@@ aying the Smo@@ g rule according to K@@ lagen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , repe@@ aled , that the states are committed to em@@ it smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step@@ per .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday , that called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ &apos;s 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they will show the commitment of the Agency , with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and , that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA announced in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be observed in order to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to imp@@ ose a wide range of environmental impacts , former president Barack Obama , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda , according to Tr@@ ump to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature reserves , who wor@@ ried about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA website suggests that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air that o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and increase respiratory sympt@@ om , &quot; such as as@@ thma .
common aims to community
in the end , the decision was clear : two counter@@ votes decides on the Common Area of Flu@@ orn Win@@ eries to establish a community space in the future retirement home .
in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece was signed , writes Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ams .
although it is still going to last until the parish church belonging to previously , there is no planning tool for the project &apos;s private investor .
there is a discussion relating to a shared space .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council fore@@ front , such a common room is not considered to be the meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ derly living environment , but open to the community .
for example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the running budget already last autumn , is supported by convey@@ ors .
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint space would be that T@@ j@@ ams , with 60 percent reduction of 30 percent .
the decision of the decision to be sign@@ alled to the investor , that there is no bil@@ lets between the legs , the firm that has been inspired by the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which would be reduced - and the construction of economic power - that would be possible .
un@@ necessarily , so don &apos;t only be Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when &apos;s Hel@@ ps : unanimously , he succe@@ eds the Board of Directors .
not so simple goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Name refers to the many own buildings , with which you don &apos;t want to go right now in common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am difficult to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for a common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a sub@@ mer@@ y sub@@ sid@@ y to the property of property or by foreign investors .
that &apos;s not so , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give an allowance , but will receive a true , in doubt the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request , correspon@@ d@@ ingly reduced the resolution , there will be three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it remains with two counter@@ voices at the original program , that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises this : &quot; if we make the decision , we make a big step to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot;

hike in the resin of Stern to star
the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created in the Harz mountains .
this is planning the association Z@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet route has been in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; come to the information needs of many har@@ z@@ visitors , it was called .
he connecting nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
members want to set up on the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well achieved installations to five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ still@@ s of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet .
therefore , in the site selection , a good mobile network reception is played .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sign path , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned , why stars have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , even though he was considerably more removed .
this also will be convey@@ ed in which constellation is a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal National Park , the location is part of the Federal Office for Nature Conservation and the six dark regions in Germany .
there are often the and@@ ro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y clearly visible from there , and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the sponsor@@ ship of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 at the initiative of the Association Agreement - the Planet@@ arium .
beginning from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , the planetary route with its legs up to H@@ ain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the panels with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ drawn Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away .
the total distance from the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun up to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need an excellent hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would last still half a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am risen for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could be held in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans after him have asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed herself to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16,@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the connection point market , presum@@ ably after a ty@@ re board the control over its vehicle .
the car sh@@ ook right into the ar@@ eption , where he beat himself and then remained on the roof in the green strips .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured through the rescue service , A7 was blo@@ cked off the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ hand strip could be directed at the accident of the accident .
Fort@@ y Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain work better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann , hop@@ ing after the 2 : 2 season open@@ er at Braunschweig that optim@@ ise the optimization of def@@ ensive points in Au@@ e points .
with the first win of the season Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , the two areas would not have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two areas too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fortuna Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle chain should also be optimised .
and a gate after a exemp@@ tion , the lag@@ o@@ ons want to un@@ cover themselves even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better right after the experience in preparing the triangle chain than with the square chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his thing certainly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just got up in the triangle chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we make even better harmon@@ ize and we do not work as many ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a mis@@ er@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can go on Sunday with four points and to focus on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I have only after six to eight games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they &apos;re starting the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player could perhaps be something fresh , as they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ en@@ sion favorites in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent , where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhineland as a light Favor@@ it go on Sunday in the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat of Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you must beat from vor@@ n@@ in , &quot; explains Fort@@ y Chef .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ power@@ ing . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application testing was published
recent findings by tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( At@@ ts@@ er@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the implementation of tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) for defects in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees had been cri@@ tici@@ zed .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 880 testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly increasing in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see great difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was evaluated more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have log@@ ged over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases the &quot; propose that &quot; the person sought for 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ b@@ la@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that 243 of these cases had said to be said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ ray photos can be made of k@@ nee @-@ teeth and MRI scans that are analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work consists of an assessment of the biological maturity of people , to see if they were previously untreated or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way , it is very un@@ safe .
if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of thought a child as adults is un@@ true , low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest risk is in it if the person is under 18 in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in Plan
working on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne had been installed on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Head of Head of the Civil Engineering Department and Transport in the Government of Freiburg .
in April , work began simultaneously on all three sanitary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , she has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and traffic security , the three buildings are thoroughly overhau@@ led .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge folder .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as operating instructions .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter width of the bridge will be used .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way should be gone .
the particular thing is that it concerns fabri@@ cated parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge arms .
special finger@@ tips has required the laying of cables through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , that many companies are connected .
in the course of the work , the residents were informed of the project by hand bal@@ lot .
in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be frozen .
in the direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic light in the direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher city entrance , the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge mit@@ ments tot@@ aling 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower Protest with German potato sal@@ at
it doesn &apos;t come so frequently to draw parties in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , it comes , what else it is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag can@@ ei@@ fel represented parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belongs to a wide alliance , showing the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle of R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster called &quot; Great Choice Subscription . &quot;
and well @-@ known name at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are before the event at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the AF@@ D developers , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now it takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , ch@@ air@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; French potato &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which could eat the AF@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have sent many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence primarily on the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the ven@@ ues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the AF@@ D vul@@ ei@@ fel , he tries to stri@@ ve for such an event and get the bid .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation because of the previously built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there is not enough parking spaces available .
so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the right thing of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle of several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled AF@@ D president Uwe Young .
in the hall , approximately 200 list@@ eners that wait for the German elections for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will keep her spe@@ ech@@ es .
unchanged , the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour will take the AF@@ D event , the guests on the court , but also there is a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 o &apos;clock rooms .
the police may ab@@ ound - no special incid@@ ents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ hearing with Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 : 00 in the Klo@@ ster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; and also &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets roots in wind music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have ar@@ op@@ positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ t joined the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the lust , not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new tra@@ w@@ ler , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ op@@ re@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ ould , mix classics , jazz and the free games to an int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing art work .
this core of the program was first performed in the spring of Freiburg in the spring of the year .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ould made it a specially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ kirche with its special acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliber@@ ately drawn into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I asked once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who ultimately went out bitter .
despite all this , the Brün@@ ette performer opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with love which I have made .
or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten said that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed seriously .
so it has never been conf@@ used or ob@@ struc@@ ted .
I &apos;ve never liked it not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but during school time , she rather than a bu@@ b dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really h@@ urt me .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and damaged .
now I look back and remember me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t want to love love life : &quot; people expect you come to a certain way , and ref@@ uses me .
and perhaps some of them describe me , but I don &apos;t like to jus@@ tify myself from all the public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia , announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice cheaper not the democratic Kan@@ did@@ st Clinton Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes provides that he has a coal shop in five states alone , and from his father have inher@@ ited a carbon store .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a statement on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; the Party of Justice of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would like to work more to us in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the last ref@@ us@@ al of a party , which is from above until down , is not able to find a positive , unified message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ est &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world &apos;s global leader , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ ster on Thursday , which he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it wasn &apos;t the moment to be taken into the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics b@@ oss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ nit@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Athle@@ tics World Championships that it was correct and decided to fight D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All athletes who were cut off in competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his commentary , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for maintaining a World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) report on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were pleased that Russian Federation has experienced themselves that they have experienced quite hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said that Russia is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that adv@@ ances were made , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start with the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still has some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden trainer are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

dou@@ b@@ ts at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen , did not be dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried beside his wife .
they shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish throne is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard had already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was named in the Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , nor unc@@ le@@ ar .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to join in his French home country .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a meal that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired to re@@ tire and also lays the title &quot; princ@@ ess . &quot;

my Danish was swe@@ ating , I prefer wine instead of beer , so@@ be@@ ating instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoke out of Virginia tobacco , and those from this country , I could not hope the mark of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in the potential majority in Lower Saxony
however , at the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is returned to a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to re@@ tire .
acqu@@ itted on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising result of a Green Party from its country in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country &apos;s choice , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its succ@@ inc@@ est one @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ ent formed their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its elect@@ oral circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU @-@ Group President Bj@@ örn Th@@ um@@ ler would recommend his Group to record them .
thus , CDU and F@@ DP would have gathered 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was vice vers@@ a .
the new country day is elected regular on the 14th of January .
Th@@ um@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must decide if they could further reg@@ ain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil , however , is holding an indispensable means that the Parliament promp@@ tly resol@@ ves his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will likely decide on Tuesday through its further notice .
the national constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament vote on the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally checked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ um@@ ler named t@@ west@@ ward step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the political scientist himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it recorded as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Green Party demanded the back@@ sliding members on the return of their land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally anticip@@ ate that they have received their land at the day , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chief @-@ president Meta @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we re@@ gre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ aken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot im@@ press this step . &quot;
election of the SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns El@@ ke T@@ ails to the CDU as a betra@@ yal for the CDU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of v@@ oters and v@@ oters but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supp@@ or@@ ated the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to quickly select the country day quickly .
the Australia &apos;s exit T@@ west@@ bound costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the political scientist , &quot; in its final el@@ ty , and her Fr@@ ust her personal interests in the justice of the country , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ dig@@ nation and tried to strike out the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the CDU faction of the CDU faction , Bj@@ örn Th@@ urg@@ ler would recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to add El@@ ke T@@ aken to the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets before , with the personal career of the country &apos;s financial year 2013 .
before the SPD , the CDU was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens in the country , however , had a very thin majority of a vote .
interview of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ ison , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect against po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Länder represent the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we currently know , health haz@@ ards is virtually impossible .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs do out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Länder .
nevertheless , my house has dis@@ connected immediately and has been in contact with the authorities of the countries in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading is the same as the manufacturers ensure that the products sold are capable of traffic and health .
if at eggs the resi@@ due level of 0.0@@ 04 mg / kg is exceeded , they are not able to transport .
inc@@ rimin@@ ated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the firms .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boot ?
after the present knowledge the production facilities meets no immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , they must anticip@@ ate economic damages due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always there is too little Controll@@ ers in harvest .
is it just missing at the staff or also in any of the swe@@ eping jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have been exposed to the process .
however , the truth is , however , that food fr@@ aud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
this is why a consequ@@ ent En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and the hand@@ over to the coun@@ ties in the cases where off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance .
I have already done multiple times , that I expect a seamless En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm @-@ extremis@@ m in food security really necessary ?
consumer products and consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transport food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer and consumer are righ@@ t@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the provided funding , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ de Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the post@@ ure of life @-@ toler@@ ated animals is not acceptable and must be finished immediately .
it must be consistently consistent on all levels and with high pressure .
I wait from all relevant authorities that the atomic facts are breeding and un@@ inhib@@ ited .
how the Fiscal Code of Football to Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at deci@@ ding , un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European foot@@ football , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , for the guiding organisation that the European game monitors power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play Rules , which was launched in 2011 by UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G must re@@ prove that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moves to France .
PS@@ G can make money back with safety , thereby Ne@@ ym@@ outh and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich men family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must reci@@ proc@@ ate the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations had enormous debt in their stri@@ ving after success , effectively fr@@ aud@@ ited and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in@@ ise when banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentration to the deb@@ ts of the clubs to the surveillance of their losses .
the change meant that the novel Ab@@ ram@@ o@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the Presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA @-@ successor Alek@@ sander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to qu@@ it out of excessive expend@@ it@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead , and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA EURO for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice amount over the duration of his contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years tot@@ alled EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought together PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the worst sanctions .
the PS@@ G was reduced to EUR 60 million , which was reduced to 20 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , which remains limited to 21 players in the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season .
the UEFA is based on clubs that could try to over@@ lay their financial confidence by holding their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a club , puff@@ ed up .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could have transp@@ onder@@ s PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA will not be considered legi@@ timate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA Tourism Authority was se@@ wn by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will come to Qatar about the organis@@ ational committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argu@@ ed that the N@@ ym@@ ar FIFA World Championship will simply be able to find out a new man@@ eu@@ ver for UEFA regulation .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will still be more atten@@ tive to re@@ mind the rules every attempt .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of the anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since it wasn &apos;t fu@@ elled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive at a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association assumes that revenue will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ener , argu@@ ed that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Kat@@ ars .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations from La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect financi@@ ally Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sc@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past few years , Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y is manufactured on board ch@@ ocol@@ ates for the Swiss Life .
now the s@@ wis@@ s collaboration stands before a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged goods panels are spread to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of advertising effect : for a bar@@ k manufacturer , it is a prestigious contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants are available for the new call , Swiss will not betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in question , only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty on the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was unable to reach an opinion .
chocolate bars distributed Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut made a collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .

blow against Drugs @-@ Mafia in the Land
the police managed a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ ain , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched for as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Konstan@@ z .
at the age of 25 , 15 students aged 25 and 77 have been arrested and issued warran@@ ts against this .
in addition , the officials requested greater quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and hundreds of thousands of thousand Euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will presum@@ ably be delivered to Germany .
the action was involved in Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe non@@ violence , ad@@ dic@@ tive murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in the Southern German area has been established since summer 2016 .
among the leaders in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large deployment of the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the vis@@ or of investigations were mainly Italian citizens with regards to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident happened on May 27 in hi@@ ps , where several shots were fired at a restaurant where they should go to the Ban@@ de account .
how do big g@@ aps compl@@ ain in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens , which should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner @-@ register proves significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that lead to partly serious fault decisions in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register .
def@@ ici@@ encies in the registered data could occur at asylum procedures and deport@@ ations . &quot; result in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts are not well @-@ kept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or citizens who have become German citizens , and in the register there should be no longer experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data log@@ ging can significantly slow@@ down any recur@@ ring processes , &quot; says the report .
in statistics about foreigners people , EU citizens should not be gathered , who would not have to travel .
such false accounts , however , &quot; led to a dis@@ si@@ dered debate on dealing with travel intelligence , &quot; is therefore in analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ duction Newspaper . &quot;
according to the paper , &quot; BA@@ MF will conduct such processes concerning families with children - except for infants and infants , in accordance with Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible to notice the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to achieve them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the travel destination .
to the grounds write the office now : &quot; the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have handed over for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) shall provide these promises for sufficient .
other EU states would also send it back to the Dublin agreement .
the internal t@@ roph@@ ies of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children are threat@@ ens because of def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful recording conditions and a endanger@@ ing of the childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the atten@@ uation of inflation have fought spec@@ ulation about a rise .
the Bank of England , war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; contracts &quot; will remain , when they kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members an increase in which the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on households would continue to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years of interest it would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ x@@ it , making it more than expected to rise to financial markets more than expected .
members also voted to return a part of the Mamm@@ ut Business Pak@@ ets which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide a cheaper financial means for banks , although it was predicted that they are expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the frame of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains short term , because the pressure on the real income of households continue to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent , when the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the bank stressed that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecasts published at the bottom of this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in comparison .
she has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros .
the decision of no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have fought the rising expectations for a interest rate , and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the Bank &apos;s end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and small sal@@ ari@@ ous cav@@ ity because the tigh@@ tening is first worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy will not prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages become clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumer expenditure .
the decision comes after the lo@@ wering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ ks .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call had risen after interest rate , since inflation increased to hard bed@@ time households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July increased an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to be put again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that , in relation to their target of 2 % , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak pounds must be attributed to the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ agne , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ al Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to look more competitive , as the lending .
the market looks especially good for those who run the existing deals and include the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low ratios are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should rein@@ force 10,000 people over the controversial HIV drug
patients will be received from September after a struggle against the Higher Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ treatment treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ re@@ ac@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high ris@@ ons by around 86 percent , from health service to a first three year study of estimated 10,000 people is delivered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eal uph@@ eld a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice , whose N@@ HS had to pay the authority , in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cart@@ el announced on Thursday was signed by N@@ HS England @-@ CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual Health Clin@@ ics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield for the first belong to people who will be able to make registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ disp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV samples that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced the HIV transmission in the risk of infections .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so for two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come in question , are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified that the study will agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who receive a partner , whose HIV @-@ status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a resident physician , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the programme is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medications in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study is intended to assess the overall potential of Pre@@ p , investig@@ ating clinical ne@@ sts , as well as in large scale , recorded and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the successful efforts to prevention HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in maintaining one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted at needy and endanger@@ ed people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epi@@ demic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England developed to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a partnership with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the &quot; Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , &quot; said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out rapidly throughout the country , and that nobody has left the risk of HIV .
now , since the Pre@@ p test medicine was introduced , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Minister for Foreign Affairs , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pre@@ p process is due to months delay and del@@ aying the government by the government .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of HIV in society .
living the Great Life : mezzanine and smart designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment to a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their pockets .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and they had the same high ceilings .
I love me in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a closed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she instruc@@ ted the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create a home of 12.5 feet and a home , not just a development , but also a place for life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the provision .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stack@@ ed together , without having to g@@ aps ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just meant to build a simple platform , but let the steel be so fit that it had the right level for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper sky@@ lights can be down from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors play a role in adding theater , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work for him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ ro@@ red units for all asp@@ ir@@ ons and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can be un@@ used when it is not used .
folded kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so important if you push the door to the door , very easily sli@@ pping . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate mak@@ ler will occur and perform a calculation based on the base size . &quot;

brothers fight for a 500 million dollars in real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate visits Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and business is sub@@ divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 property have a value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the V@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the outskirts of the city .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Colin - by Paul as &quot; primary writer and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is roughly one @-@ third .
a judicial report indicates that Colin is property of $ 316 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ bl@@ emp@@ point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the she@@ w@@ ling releases have left him with the left what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice was held on Friday .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business , including Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but gives Paul to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to sett@@ le the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs inc@@ urred in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ ac@@ ies shops from the late 1950 @-@ 1990s and bought a store in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 70s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood singer in which Colin the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
Colin says that he began West Germany when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their own property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Colin claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has very re@@ lied , although he was a former AF@@ L member , and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers contact .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; because the case should be before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul decided to conc@@ ise me and draw our family names through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin in a letter to the judgment that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have thought that Paul and I would end in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he and added that he is still in a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Colin .
Tr@@ umps new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports from the news media - in hope to hold the b@@ oss on a more equal course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with executive staff , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he rep@@ airing : bad information , into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that you should flow through it - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the president would get better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
cell@@ ars Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to nar@@ row@@ away tr@@ ump by super@@ v@@ ise his media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to television lasts decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the candidate was denied because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to tell him that he was a fair reporting of places , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former elect@@ oral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter custom under control , according to six former elect@@ oral struggle officials , aimed at ensuring that his personal media consumption contains a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps this Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ beam@@ ten know something what we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets could have more combus@@ tible material without its interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the Twe@@ ets where Tr@@ ump did not broadcast .
if his staff have already been able to maintain it , troub@@ les from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently opposed to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem is in fact that people involved in a White House composed of competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that possibly encour@@ ages their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO -@@ entirely with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , the president of strategic reasons imp@@ eded information .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump react to negative public@@ ity sections , especially those with damaged ch@@ equ@@ es , and that it emerg@@ es from where these origin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody made a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ aps at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter to Twitter , or has no concrete evidence offered , or that he has expressed false declar@@ ations in the past , and has with@@ drawn them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to in@@ quire about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly has tried three months later , to do the same .
perhaps he will prove themselves as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still fight for influence .
this imm@@ utable factors make wa@@ its mission very difficult .
Mei@@ ji wanted crimin@@ als get post of Europ@@ ol

the police in all of Europe sends postal cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of searched s@@ ni@@ ers are not known in nature , references from the population will be hop@@ ing and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house@@ owner of West Mid@@ lands are again negoti@@ ated with some notable trav@@ ellers on war@@ der which have drawn up a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the traveler have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull which is called &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , having been thrown out only in May , without having to be stretched out by a council excav@@ ated by a council , to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
angry inhabitants have har@@ assed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went back on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they cast stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced through Sch@@ am to implement it , since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traveler were in May there , were moved and are now back again .
last night yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to overthrow it by taking long sub @-@ assign@@ ments to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m not happy on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay off my commission when the Council can &apos;t stop once . &quot;
a residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of this traveler just to be lo@@ oted out of another round .
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an in@@ fusion camp on the country beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we realize the necessary legal steps to continue it as soon as possible .
in order to support our suppliers , it is very important that many residents can sign a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check if we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes forest hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the forest hotel Lu@@ ise will be found .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the town .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the time @-@ ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the time of April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , rising dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the County , the hotel buildings were offered as collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by placing an area plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted in the congregation at that time .
but mainly Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel grounds and spoke already at the time of serious prospective customers at the house .
he should retain judgment .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been in front of the entrance and when you enter the house , and when you enter the house , vast renov@@ ations are made .
the so@@ ils were removed out , ceilings to partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is re@@ designed , the new window will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming @-@ pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the amenities .
it is not to be positioned at high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher @-@ scale city level , emphasi@@ zes sciss@@ ors .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both tourists , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause have already been led , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the height of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to be precisely determined .
almost under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also placed on front , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Representative to the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special representative Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the Committee took up the work in the past weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported , there is already the first inv@@ itations of the universe in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us @-@ intelligence bl@@ ame the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , specifically to have mixed themselves in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were a question between Tr@@ umps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the investigation of the investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Republi@@ can fight &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump personally identi@@ fies the center and ob@@ struc@@ ted whether the president in the wake of aff@@ air may imp@@ ose the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ies is to check and take this evidence in potential waste cases and to decide whether the indictment will be charged .
the Grand jur@@ ies are therefore also called anch@@ ors .
they are mostly switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
in addition , the panel may also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge persons to inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation under E@@ id .
according to the transmitter CN@@ N , demonstrations have already been issued , which rot@@ ate around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
people who were involved in the meetings were to be asked to a statement , the name was stated in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging Chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he continued with the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday night in US television that prove that Mu@@ eller should not be so@@ ber in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening continued a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good because they can &apos;t have anything else to talk about it . &quot;
his special Advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knew nothing of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
however , these work usually in path@@ ogens , stressed out .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Representative to &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I CEO James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President be determined .
you have no reason to accept that something changed , it was named in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ asis , acc@@ us@@ ations had become no@@ isy according to Tr@@ ump , he w@@ anting the judi@@ ci@@ ary to the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
com@@ ey said in June prior to a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the former national security advis@@ ers Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under a great pressure because of its investigation .
according to the representation of US media , the White House of Material collected materials against the Special Offer and its Staff .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about what Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller may be released .
unlike an independent special representative of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air , as stated in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air , Mu@@ eller has become a position he could be fired on the pre@@ sidents of the President of Justice of Justice .
several representatives of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented the legis@@ l@@ ature on Thursday before which the Special Court could not be released as easy .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : massive Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg has been replaced by the barely seven @-@ times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra .
this was shared by the Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large col@@ oss is now north and I will need two to three years until it was mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice @-@ giant researchers registered in the last three decades .
a danger for humans is not coming from him .
to what extent the climate change played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , is unc@@ le@@ ar according to research .
in total , however , around 30 years ago , there have been a series of unusual co@@ aches of iron sh@@ ells in the region , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ t@@ orial ground .
according to many researchers , this can be connected with global warming .
the now broken col@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ik .
sl@@ ums are swi@@ m on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is therefore growing steadily in the sea , and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ote lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this shr@@ ink , the balance of w@@ ax@@ les and ab@@ rupt@@ cy was distur@@ bed by some years ago .
a complete sc@@ arf is there , writes A@@ WI researcher from Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it would have a lot to do that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ik &apos;s danger is in danger , because the front edge did not yet go back as far as currently .
furthermore , the ice @-@ board stand under tension and can be destroyed in case of a key@@ hole in case of a key@@ hole .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ elt and Eis@@ berg will not increase the sea level , because they can swi@@ m on the water and consume as much water as it results in the m@@ elt .
however , the loss of the shadow leads the gl@@ acier directly into the sea , and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , however , only in a small measure , writes the British research project for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ elt &apos;s Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ sciss@@ ors are the fourth @-@ largest lap of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean , around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it is natural , it is no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield comes in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ don &apos;t grow again or long @-@ term , and possibly , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers are not attributable to the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gig@@ antic ice r@@ ink , in recent decades , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have been destroyed during the past few decades .
this long summit of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the iron surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline was contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have passed away in the past 50 years by around three degrees and thus t@@ opped the areas where the temperature at the fastest .
CDU request bon@@ fire rate at the personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to occup@@ y freedom , the CDU , from the employer association , demands more attractive to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has made 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees began their first working day behind .
the teaching position in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applications were recorded for this year to forgive places .
nevertheless , the circle l@@ acks further personnel to tackle the increased requirements and tasks .
currently there are currently 50 positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for general administration .
the CDU now wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to inter@@ act in the administration of skilled workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is planned to work with the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and human development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to discover , not only short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but future @-@ oriented applicants may counter@@ act it .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent themselves to inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational campaign , demand the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advertise good civil servants and staff and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is controlled by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer competition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related service comes from the service .
highest time for action thus , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , president of the CDU , went out with his party by his party .
he had long been standing in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a fine @-@ thick surprise , when he publicly presented the number of personnel publicly in question and the remaining parties .
people would like to check all the possibilities that allow an outlet from the municipal employer association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t come short notice to a satisfactory solution , the district administration with trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a hood @-@ tariff obligation , &quot; so peoples .
the CDU tries to pay the CDU , employees and officials better when accept@@ ing the public service for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact , enh@@ ancements or more money is only if you changes to a higher level , which is orient@@ ated to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and the director Martin Richter have a problem . they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the audio to NGO &apos;s mig@@ rant rescue mission
Italy introduced NGOs that war@@ n the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they do not continue to keep on new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t have a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their crew had co@@ operated effectively with traffic@@ kers in a manner that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the relief organization , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express himself to some exec@@ uting the Italian citizen Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life is our top priority . so we are so sorry we could not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not assess any claims that is currently being raised , when we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is believed that his crew war@@ ding@@ h@@ y mig@@ rant on board , which can be delivered directly from traffic@@ kers , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that ships can be used again .
at least one of these religious meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to susp@@ end about the authority of the Italian coast@@ gu@@ ards , rescue mission in zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other mo@@ tives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct you have to have boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly on board an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
just three of the nine NGOs that participated in search and rescue operations are so far ready to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter , on Thursday , said that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but un@@ acceptable because they would not have any significant changes or disabilities . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti then said that the number of migrants who came to Italy came strongly in the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Co@@ ast@@ ards and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan Citi@@ zens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope , to reach Europe .
sti@@ p@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin Stock Exchange &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the North pf@@ al@@ z , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and attractions .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ enheim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels .
da@@ between there was always longer sti@@ p@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim towards the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again the look@@ out spot point out at look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days many al@@ ti@@ meter were cancelled again .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equipment for e @-@ sport
will the sports @-@ stars be sitting in the future of computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the Stadium race ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been become a serious industry that has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - huge stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
these also have recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aments , which are increasingly committed in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport department for the computer game FIFA 17 in mid @-@ July .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire your new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete in different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ ut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen also advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football team must cut itself in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs attempted to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , conquer .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be present online more often on these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ liga sponsor@@ ship to Asia .
what is it exactly about ?
computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level .
long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen have become established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly ordinary .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has set itself a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that you can find in classic sports , for example , increased heart rate effects , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , co@@ gni@@ tive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not just exercise on the console but also exercise their body and respect the nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte players is a good player . &quot;
but also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
insp@@ ections be feasi@@ ble for online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classic sports .
the scientists emphas@@ ises the high integ@@ rative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are international on the road , which is like a large global family , there is no intercultural communication .
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales in three years is expected to lie with 130 million .
for the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is a little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; isn &apos;t far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International has already been many countries .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sh@@ aqu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez am US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher invests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting party Uni@@ kr@@ n .
too , too much in Europe is something very much .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as class@@ y , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first liga associations are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in no@@ stal@@ gia , and the old times en@@ ligh@@ ten , this is not enough to escape .
it is therefore to keep the tradition of the association , but the company simultaneously den@@ si@@ zing the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ ut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you can &apos;t hold it , that only in football everything remains so , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts that Conrad Roy had committed suicide ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and two years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind guitar@@ ists and five years have been exposed to currency .
Carter was condemned in June for neg@@ lig@@ ent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on July 13 , 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representative argu@@ ed that both they had suffered a psychological disease as well as Mr Roy .
in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter da with t@@ ears came in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was sentenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions took Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Prosec@@ ution to the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has not assumed responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no re@@ gre@@ t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but car@@ ters attor@@ ney said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a terrible circum@@ stance , whom they totally re@@ gre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not show that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their human@@ ities have no significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; no day , in whom I didn &apos;t sei@@ ze the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I am going to go with everything . I try to bear in spite of all my pain@@ s that we are for et@@ ernity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this one person who I was together since my birth each day , is a pain that I always keep myself for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to asser@@ t a right preced@@ ent if there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime that makes it a question of suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a hydro@@ carbon po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to herself , after car@@ ters stated text releases , that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hän@@ g you up , spring from a building , tell you yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was in holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do , is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought the death of Roy , and ordered that they benefit from any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
on the few , the Carter announced , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 because of murder on their British co @-@ resident , was acqu@@ itted before two years ago .
woman Knox , 30 years of age , published in Los Angeles Times comments : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
when Joshua was running at the Audi Cup as captain , Joshua was no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut to the Con@@ tractor Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation will not harm you .
something was otherwise on his place in the cabin , that Joshua saw K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional garment is very small , very small .
but there was no Philipp Lah@@ m on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer , he made his h@@ ub@@ by bin@@ d to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told , after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have better run as at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character from Coach could also suggest K@@ imm@@ i as well .
not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player leader in youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the holiday of professionals , existing C @-@ El@@ f , but he .
sugar is distribut@@ ing to those who want to do much to those who want to keep at w@@ une .
who therefore refined , the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation just fine .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to take as a player : assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was scre@@ ened as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right side , this is now its position , the white bonds on the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i took part in this starting point , such as the one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to len@@ ose the un@@ locked tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal therefore , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ds hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches came out on the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( foldable also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nik@@ las Sü@@ le to stop their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ tri@@ kot .
the after all goes well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ acted so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm did often get hard , moreover , Sü@@ le tried to build up a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not so , as we have hop@@ ing for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
game storage , speed change : &quot; I was also brought to this style . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how un@@ used these Bayern @-@ Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new int@@ ages , one looked to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i approved a few cr@@ un@@ y statements in the back of his new gam@@ ers .
there he heard about Sü@@ le a interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I &apos;ve already noted .
with Bayern You just need to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New Testament anymore .

companies satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled ministers : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was an economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is shown after more than one year , in which the new Minister for Finance , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V en@@ quiry by a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ orf at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tren@@ ner Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes care of the wishes of the economy to blo@@ cked Lem@@ ke &apos;s office . &quot;
the greatest turn of turn is Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the crossing of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now available in the pri@@ ori@@ ental list of the country .
this year , the ministry is hop@@ ing for a planning process , up to 2021 the building will be right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans will also play the West@@ enc@@ um@@ ption of Trier , which stands in the pre @-@ urg@@ ent demand of the Federal Office .
the aim is to go into operation in December 2020 , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann says .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is stri@@ pped like of knowledge as a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in super@@ markets and stop the trend of German Wine exports since ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , you have an open ear for people who want to establish a company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is looking for an additional incen@@ tive for young appren@@ tices , &quot; says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the fee of 1000 Euros for the constitu@@ ent championship inspection and 2500 euros , when graduates are independent within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .

of 56 new engineers who wants to configure the knowledge of the country &apos;s mobility , 29 places are now occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to external offices .
CDU @-@ Group vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Court of Au@@ d@@ itors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads by 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country , such as it wants to remedy the pharmaceutical angel in the region .
Moreover , the far full range of broadband would be in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they disp@@ ose of increasing internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Economy Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still standing in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Mill Pro Wind .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ators con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus rising to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located to provide or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced today that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as re@@ vocation .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , also take part , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ign@@ ore the powerful car companies to ign@@ ore and ign@@ ore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters that could regul@@ ate the regulations if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not delivered before delivery and could be set before the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was engaged in Germany &apos;s criminal investigations , having accused of having installed a system to destroy the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation might be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportional to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los kn@@ u@@ gh and the laughter to the suffering ;
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most @-@ released Cart@@ oon @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still stands and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck down among others as a sign for gambling tickets by - which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when in my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60s , the breakthrough : with the release of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist has always been inspired by the artists of cities .
large , ro@@ unding Mor@@ di@@ llo figures can be found in Dra@@ wings with the front tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he sits according to his own details , today it works almost ten hours daily .
over calendar , puzzles , books for young and small , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and watches will continue to find much spread worldwide .
since six years he has also been working on a animation film and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ler as counter@@ acting .
for the first time , his figures speak to the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore , it is more on the TV series , which is produced , as its original drawings , which is produced un@@ parall@@ eled .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the d@@ rought @-@ rec@@ alled conditions and due to diseases @-@ borne , resulting scientists , farmers , trying to find solutions , great head@@ ache .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M , in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small sp@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ ac@@ ter@@ ti@@ y , transfers the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it stands much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not just for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are taken into account , include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the evap@@ oration of the ground , but also the filling of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state Sin@@ al@@ oa in the state Sin@@ al@@ oa into the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa throughout the organised crime , corrupt civil servants and non @-@ audi@@ ble drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
discuss two high @-@ level journalists , which feel safe : they are supposed to take their children with the office , who were to leave at home in 2009 or at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
you ask the re@@ porter , name for each column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal feeling .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the contents list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no retirement age of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are often more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 , and then there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their editors and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest error is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply immer@@ sed , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , it depends on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts to show the sm@@ iling face with glasses and its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a Special Tribunal was established to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traffic@@ king and organized crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely demonstrated .
with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist on dealing with the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ locked and even though the terrain is still slan@@ ted .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know , we don &apos;t miss out all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced to leave him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
he drove in his car away , and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to walk freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the theme of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing silent as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ les@@ ions , since riv@@ alis@@ ms frac@@ tions remain here to fill the vacuum .
it is nothing of that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day one or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of galvanized , two @-@ story mou@@ th@@ een , which is bigger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a condition of &quot; rest &quot; if only one has to control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , is broken with the bl@@ ame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the riv@@ alis@@ ative cart@@ el frac@@ tions held in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed power @-@ members purchased every copy of the edition when it was shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was in which Val@@ dez was not forced to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este , joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to engage journ@@ alism without having to cra@@ ck the noise problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and hon@@ est reporting , and revenue and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters love it to publish hard tre@@ ff@@ ing investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that were able to read stories that nobody wanted to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it was .
he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live more , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction .
drug traffic@@ king in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; they must take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I would not want to be asked : &quot; what did you do because of many dead ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun party , like a do@@ er worker , the friend , the gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he always would carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ a , the bar opposite the office , and sit there on the same table .
then ask them : was his love for routine ?
his death also forced her to ask their own investment in question , as they can do their work on the best and staying at life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like you with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret start and landing ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of suicide and self @-@ conservation .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts commit .
if it is wrong , unle@@ ash away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the cause with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa , not even as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ r@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were no mobile phones allowed . days earlier , spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two polic@@ eman protection against heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) sought in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in kid@@ ding , some of the re@@ porter asked whether these officers are part of the 50 per cent of polic@@ emen who are not tru@@ st@@ worthy to the Governor of himself .
since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug subjects de fac@@ to have been under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blo@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother &apos;s former son Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an exc@@ pos@@ é to the state spending that concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word that who has been ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was careful that everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Poli@@ ti@@ cian , which belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost all political levels throughout the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter to write about previous incid@@ ents in this location , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went up to a military attack .
only a few months previously , the readers of Val@@ dez should have considered the best found source on the ab@@ duction .
&quot; previously we wanted to know what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated for the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff have become something to have expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez spread a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests that it is .
throughout the country , journalists have been stronger , by organizing them in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and construction .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is going to Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
when a meeting with governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to proc@@ laim journalists and to destroy them , because they have said the truth .
it has since then asked that they were re @-@ divided by the government , because it is concerned that their rage has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly spoken that journalists in Mexico of organized crime , involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you believe , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a terrible effect .
nobody is forgotten the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas artist : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones beside her separate head .
some stores have chosen , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of Cor@@ respon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the assassination of its Directors in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly directed to the drugs card with an editorial on the front page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home countries or even out of the country .
it &apos;s a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as apparently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , it &apos;s a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , is that the drug traffic@@ king is troubled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began .
a number of sho@@ wer@@ ies with belt riv@@ als and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ bst@@ ones from the on @-@ board , they have published their news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ls close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held W@@ ache to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had fear all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the newspaper &quot; The newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible to the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was murdered on the same day , the intern called me to send them to reporting on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , even a terri@@ fying .
now researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian Berg@@ man were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his ch@@ apped skin from red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she had had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ster@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever had found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ pan@@ te plant fe@@ e@@ aters is the best preserved F@@ ossil in its kind .
it was found by Sh@@ awn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , sep@@ tic .
he met something , which seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks , and decided to see more closely .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ eling .
after all of this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it was Sle@@ pt , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the cre@@ ature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ our , and a changing tank is res@@ embles , probably from me@@ ats of carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong anti@@ pan@@ te din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide from carni@@ vo@@ res , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technique , which is used as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to so@@ ak his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time and is now on display at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ realistic op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technici@@ an Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of copy enabled it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
it discovered the con@@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ aded sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , since the size of bo@@ tt@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far exceeding the today living animals survi@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs re@@ jects the din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure by the carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ frontation in con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most contemporary animals who use the sh@@ aded sh@@ aded - do you think of Reh@@ e , Zeb@@ ras or g@@ ird animals - are much smaller and infr@@ inging than sp@@ oil , what sign@@ alled that this no@@ dos@@ rier had been exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong cra@@ w@@ al behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs Rob@@ ust have been to have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ans , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs rot@@ ein was red .
scientists will continue to examine the animal on his life , including his preserved Dar@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river and beyond the sea , where he sank to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with con@@ served wood , but also in three dimensions it remains and the original form of the beast keeps , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only think a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ realistic op@@ el@@ ta , was ch@@ ased by the t@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs of some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this is the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ realistic op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ um@@ i@@ fied .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sh@@ awn Funk at Sh@@ awn Mine at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , sep@@ tic .
according to the museum it is the survi@@ ving din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely surrounded by the mu@@ zzle until hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the ch@@ air@@ planes car@@ ed by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so good that the skin &apos;s vest will always cover hol@@ low tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , there is such a level of conservation as &apos; sel@@ dom as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the be@@ wil@@ dering will be .
the skin cre@@ ws on the skin always cover hol@@ low ar@@ mo@@ red plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed the top .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on the Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 trucks are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , k@@ id leng@@ th@@ wise - and gr@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people were injured .
after the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a wit@@ ters just under 30 vehicles , including trucks , including trucks .
no information about the exact number of the latter were not disclos@@ ed .
it is a mild to moderate injury to moderate @-@ to @-@ severe injuries .
a big charged on rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a roughly ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ stage .
like an AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous cast@@ ers .
the fire brig@@ ade did note the mark of the vehicle cre@@ denti@@ sts , which now have to calculate with sensitive stra@@ pping .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs then another accident happened on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision at a coll@@ ision between a vehicle transpor@@ ters and passenger cars .
rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group checks &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing sits in the train and sleep@@ eth .
or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the do@@ cking and aw@@ ak@@ eth an un@@ gently or have the driving pleasure in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but times of inter@@ ruptions are past soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently testing the online ticket control .
you are simply confirmed by mobile phone that we have taken up and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , wide we look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of upcoming year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the railway crossing the ticket recovery without any conductor .
in order to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which does already have to do most of passengers .
you also need to have purchased the DB Navigator app that &apos;s the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calling its ticket by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for electronic recovery .
the train conductor get a message for their mobile devices , that driving licence X is located in the train and taken the booked seat in Y .
comes the train companion in place Y knows that there is a passenger with already existing online ticket is placed there .
you can continue to pass , keep working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the course - what is supposed to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who wish to travel fully without ticket control by our train staff , check out the DB navig@@ ator by yourself .
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Executive Board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often does train , know that in addition to del@@ ays and dist@@ rac@@ ted trains , the ticket controls will be one of the biggest troub@@ les .
for often , in any case , however , one of the participants does not have all documents that are needed for the recovery of online tickets .
either missing the credit card or the identity card or a document that has to be present .
the result are endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the section or major room and del@@ ays with the control of your own tickets and takes care of the workers at the end the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same way are not un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken at her heart on 9 August 2014 .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , sat on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since nobody had posted information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah has been continuously ret@@ arded at its tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live to twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of brow@@ n@@ ishing body who was out@@ stretched out on the road and stay there for four hours there .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive at the evening .
there were photos of police band and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed on which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ate dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I as@@ sured another polic@@ eman , and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt packed .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that they were driving on the next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , the love and the power , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who drove a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they discussed the two a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember how I taught you , when black men have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what they said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; that &apos;s what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know , and it should see it .
it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I have good luck to give you a experience at which they personally don &apos;t have a ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women @-@ child .
I have the feeling , I would have to point out a bad service , to keep it far away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was waiting for an camp as the activists on the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected to a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and hal@@ ting them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to accept Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August total , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ Course Association , focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it all came . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or tried to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ ticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as T@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , had already been working together with his activ@@ ism , who is famous for his activ@@ ism .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell &apos;s project closer together with six other loc@@ als , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are displayed , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not around the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Messiah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , but around one community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s lives , like she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s history repeated the role of the black sw@@ inging women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement which have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in manag@@ erial positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it exists , however , that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; by Fer@@ rell based on their identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who touched this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although she was at the front of the front , because in a life of these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone since , but the ra@@ cial links between the municipality and the police continues .
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she sc@@ amm@@ ates to a voice and she feels committed to that memory ever since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size f@@ auc@@ et &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although they are not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south @-@ ending @-@ pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation in 2009 in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold makes the subject hardly one .
the theme will also be discussed at our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one can say to the Bit Gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Show@@ cases ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build on that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers in the city , of which the remaining stores take advantage of which the pedestrian prec@@ inc@@ t are ble@@ eding .
there is also : the gallery will be on the plot planned on which the pe@@ asant market stands , in which 13 directors offer their products .
with the beginning of constructions it will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as well as for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been living in the pe@@ asant hall for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the vir@@ gins are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like to wish you , even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether for marketing to a market hall in the gallery , it comes to the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably not be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
one sees how many shop@@ points are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least the market hall remains .
because after all , the product is fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is also reas@@ on@@ ably priced .
as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping mall , because the rentals are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , there are almost no more and that &apos;s what else it is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ asant market place during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration , when the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does the F@@ Bit @-@ Galerie have already to distribute all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s just not working .
and a shopping center that is empty , nobody is needed .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant markets there is a lot more - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space anymore .
if the Far@@ mers market is broken , there will van@@ ish a piece of culture . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown that are almost in@@ atten@@ tive - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ isc@@ us and Haar@@ le sections that were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former secret service analy@@ zer gave a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence after having placed diplomatic reports on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition that was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ woman and a pioneering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was only three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look like using these genom@@ ic data , such as someone could look into the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways , how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been said openly about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fr@@ aud and theft .
through the prison its image was supp@@ ressed so that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the m@@ anning in a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum blonde per@@ er is associated with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 &apos; strand Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist portra@@ yed the portraits of strange arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette mu@@ zzle and che@@ wing g@@ um by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it , like these people could look like this .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were ex@@ changing and replaced by several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic images , &quot; which would like to make a future , in which the President chel@@ ated judgment , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ er &apos;s release after seven brutal years in Kansas would ask , was a welcome type of prosper@@ ous gath@@ er@@ ings .
there is also a bit depth at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against Trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to handle the rigid spl@@ itting , which he should actually fix , further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things could happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the Galerie , the artistic statement requested M@@ anning with their over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end of &quot; automatic de@@ pl@@ ating , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ de based on the highly developed scientific enc@@ yc@@ lo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological respects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what mankind will hope , that our gen@@ ome is not to take care of what we are , and how it is genetic data for a interpretation and how subj@@ ective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work is from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ els .
it shows M@@ anning , as it comes with a Fre@@ el@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipline in the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they have cool your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so , never let the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still don &apos;t see what I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it is fore@@ seen in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulations which are combined as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ er st@@ ature ) , which were written down to their genetic ap@@ ons with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a man &apos;s volume , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , even behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human j@@ ag@@ d is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been susp@@ ects as a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago , with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts on murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , exhibited as the brief@@ ing of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a warning system that was published by the police department of Chicago was revealed that the cor@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the place of events for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the acc@@ us@@ ks as murder , while police search for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president responsible for the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now exp@@ elled and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that is studied by the relevant authorities , and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates with this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesperson on the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain , helping us to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set itself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he demanding the susp@@ ect susp@@ ect the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police got a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza , who just had a slan@@ ted tip , who said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is unc@@ le@@ ar if the incident happened on the 27th of July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and resear@@ ches a variety of mo@@ tives , including one possible incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future - Russia &apos;s Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) could be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of the WA@@ DA with respect to the Code which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything to give us reason for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned criteria , however , states that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities sought to accept the results from the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to be publicly accept@@ ing state @-@ supported d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the examination , because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system got an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programmes , and we will not ad@@ mit , what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v issued problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations but added : &quot; we have repeated that the report disp@@ uted disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
nobody has added to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded as part of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA from the execution of Dop@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , you are allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the prime minister of the organisation in Moscow in July WA@@ DA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved to the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Re@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or even worse - worse .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft and Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has called people from outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the w@@ axes to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to provide groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite executives to go directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used to measure workers .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ P@@ olls and P@@ olls of specific teams , it provides a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows most complaints and what executives can have low support results - so that you can re@@ ap . why .
in addition , the company will see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t have the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published a blog post , where those who have spoken , have been pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financing technical website of Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad conduct and saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ k@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Business lets you send customized &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; p@@ olls , confidential answers in real @-@ time and watch the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which the employees can report bad conduct .
and if the business leaders are involved , dis@@ comfort is directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of the public opinion counts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ ethical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences through consumers @-@ bo@@ yc@@ ott , workers fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that staff are aware of the policies and procedures and are a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ tim@@ id@@ al and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel who said , there was no good way to track the complaints from employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ tible is setting up problems that were previously been hi@@ ding in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practic@@ ality , were identified and addressed .
&quot; I can arrive closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with jobs , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders prior to employment and employment . &quot;
companies started to re@@ ap Ethics , values and co @-@ workers commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collap@@ sed because of ethical compar@@ isons by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media Law came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies detected that you couldn &apos;t prevent the dirty washing online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the Ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and will provide the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to take advantage of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , supporting both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , where the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ring secured a $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before .
in competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are glad to feel in a company that &apos;s their voices , that they &apos;re doing , it is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In that is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ings , when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well , when staff are working and involved .
when the Analytics tools of third party promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you &apos;ll find support .
the data about the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless , if the administrator of a company does not take measures .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it can have a anticip@@ ation that is changing in the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or even if not , this can become dis@@ appointments and employees demo@@ cra@@ cies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen it on the collecting of data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , staff will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
take care of that ?
and whom do you not care about , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now runs monthly employees p@@ olls , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is told , so refund .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize and improving the quality of communication , capable of organizing multiple teams within the company to tackle the problems of communication .
with Ruby Tuesday the company always gets new insights about the employees , and hopes for a long point of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you will also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose clients , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ cot @-@ parts and show the back of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returning to their aud@@ iting tests , before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ ti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 pm to meet the players already packed .
the compromise of the two days is more than a day , starting at the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of formal education for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the control change of N@@ CAA support even if they add a further point to the many times in the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these tremendous burden on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply cr@@ ushed it , they lo@@ ping themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , resulting in view of the clear sight of its fields from an ad@@ joining car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ aka Center , which already clear@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which will be a slight part behind a tor@@ rent .
brood @-@ players will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there will be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far back to think that people can rent a room and then take on it to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m not too wor@@ ried to me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts and examination in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook aims to send more potential articles with false reports from third parties and their results under the original entry then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a position on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning techniques to identify potential false reports , which may receive possible outcomes of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , of which many believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a great political issue in Europe where the French v@@ oters were floo@@ ded with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to eliminate social media networks , as soon as it could not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate Declaration on German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will begin .
&quot; in addition to the realization , what stories of Fak@@ ten@@ ants penet@@ rated third parties , people want to read more context in order to read and share what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testing the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years a lo@@ op@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ oph@@ a@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so beautiful to look on the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says W@@ eh@@ acc@@ ord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;@@ surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he thought un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ seller in the 1700 years that he worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always smell as smoke , because at that time there is a fire due to the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the od@@ or has an effect as it would be itself too .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who struck with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have judged my welcome drink , &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; New &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osity of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena @-@ heads of the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he mig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps that represent what poss@@ essed , &quot; you could mean that land conflict would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was one bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let all go down his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to invite a wider basis into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant revol@@ ves of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Geh@@ of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant revol@@ ts began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other histor@@ ies are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ron@@ er who hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell is depic@@ ted out of the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was first excav@@ ated when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rhodes &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney said : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen have to be a bit more deb@@ ts and give money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men dissolved their debt cris@@ es by giving rich old women - I place them as a bun@@ ch of good looking guys , with a talent to advertise your binnen . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle Rhodes on the search for other unique shr@@ ub experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ zi@@ mer@@ mä@@ ki behind it , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been called back from the nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mary &apos;s chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 year old Mary &apos;s chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor of Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will hold the logo and slogan of the slogan of Nelson Art@@ z .
end of August it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm convic@@ tions that we know as Bad Hon@@ our citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the promotion , it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city a distinctive characteristic feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , I stand up in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium five @-@ digit amount can be provided by the city of Bad Honnef for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) dispos@@ es of pen@@ sion@@ ations and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
under the presidency of the Heads of State , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus , civilians in the Y@@ as were the number of civilians .
the government with@@ draws the bre@@ e@@ ers in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the He@@ eres , the Air Forces and the Navy .
since the failed cou@@ p , President Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als has fired .
more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the Movement of Ex@@ ile Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a clin@@ ch of the coup .
for 4@@ 86 persons , which should have been participating in the attempt at the coup , has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day after the coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup attempt to give him the opportunity to complete the forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s army really in the handle ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; dis@@ comfort &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there will be concern for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army that manifest itself among others in the re@@ vocation of the head@@ tu@@ ties for Sol@@ dat@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big puri@@ fier in the army and the security forces will continue in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent more 73@@ 95 citizens with fire , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed , when I t@@ aming Erd@@ og@@ an to the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
th@@ rice they had three times under appeal to their role as the guard of world leaders .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the force of the military &apos;s step by step , but not least was calling for the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say that Erd@@ og@@ an is targeted for an Islam@@ ization of armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ned for asylum from persecution before persecution in abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and ano@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets that too , such development could not leave the Nat@@ o cold .
anyway , in the alliance to pur@@ ge , there is dou@@ b@@ ts about the application of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nat@@ o diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it looks before , reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for visa @-@ oriented vis@@ as and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do that by the USA , how to exp@@ ire citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law shall prevent the migration of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates that speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and have knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
ministry wants to sanc@@ tify the route to Renn@@ es .
ever again , over the past few months , over the future of the Racing R@@ utt@@ les have been disp@@ uted - now it should be very fast .
even before the end of the year , the race track is scheduled to be built on the travel railway .
in order to secure the future of the race drive in the long term , according to the Ministry of Traffic , the course will start this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further and to san@@ itation , the country is mainly responsible for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Traffic Office Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the course is estimated to be approximately 2.5 million euros .
this sum may take 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will be finally coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ Sen@@ ingen Train as operators are already involved in the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map that negoti@@ ated vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing sti@@ ff Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the racing sti@@ ff Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot @-@ powered pilot , the distance of sufficient amount of people was used to order it again in the future .
the route is very similar in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex @-@ Rob@@ ots is real , and we should worry us
just as you thought that there may not be crazy about the technological developments in the field of sex robots in 2017 .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start their asc@@ en@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people are funny , but the company deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern rooms have evol@@ ved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon , which feel warm , with consci@@ ously human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user may also adjust its robots in accordance with his convic@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thereby select everything , from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will still be calm , since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that an Step@@ ford @-@ woman would look at progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ nor@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties , which they are eng@@ aging , as for example , counter@@ productive .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of Sh@@ oul@@ tice and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; not war@@ ms True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so it may like you like it , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has their voices - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be f@@ aint , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many more serious aspects in this asc@@ en@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ sp@@ icy female properties that goes on a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist ) Far@@ rah is un@@ tran@@ qui@@ l one on most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it means it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex@@ ist .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men , of course , don &apos;t hold any sex robot , while the FR@@ R remain their rising popularity , nevertheless , they remain at the edge of the consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak out of the boundary zones can , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these high @-@ developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which the White House gives a pre@@ sidents to attack women sexually .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the hidden bodies and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this doesn &apos;t feel like a great jump .
the aim behind these sex robots consists of physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots have no real women .
you can not separate or walk away from their companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jection .
different expressed : they are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the absence of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
it is become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political spl@@ its that polarized the US v@@ oters and also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ot there were in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to convert with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump to be converted .
we all allegedly committed ourselves to let our filter bubble burst .
less , the power of Tr@@ umps and families have been found .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family since long time visited New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including republi@@ can relationship , having fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
in order to make the dining table , this certainly is a good cause , but it falls into another context that this also brings significant risks .
the Left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the durability of his presidency has the power to push them all right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ate@@ ful way that his c@@ itt@@ ens will not stum@@ ble anymore .
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right wing , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of confusion .
I found myself from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s official version of dec@@ eased , the dog on the car that had 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - which both occur compared to Tr@@ ump in fact , as a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
if Tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be healthy , in order to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s park , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city , if there is no caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ky and the animals rot@@ ate to look at full anxiety about their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music convey@@ s this on noticeable way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és and a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not righteous .
five and thirty years later , and I haven &apos;t found out over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not included - but a large roundabout in the North of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since the two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have received the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to leave the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the Kauf@@ haus was exc@@ es@@ sive , while I get tired of experience , to submit my credit card with five stars .

last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten to the hospital , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder according to an appeal against the first female prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by giving them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night int@@ ru@@ der , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to immer@@ se this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say , they be in@@ dul@@ g@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Authority said that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa obj@@ ection and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;

as farmer Arnold will find a curious egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ flo@@ wer@@ ies from fo@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the in@@ let students continue to go to the high school , four at the secondary school .
school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Civil Society Bi@@ es@@ en@@ hofen in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol for the school release , the 29 students of four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eagle , which is fired in the ch@@ ick@@ erhof , but then put into liberty .
to this end , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to qu@@ arri@@ ed out of its ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken king , a small eagle came out .
but the hope arises out of him to make a chicken , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wor@@ e .
after that , classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank showed a chicken .
the h@@ ens dances with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is different as the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish every quad@@ ru@@ in that he felt in his new school .
than@@ k@@ ingly , than@@ ksgiving came to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Mu@@ eller , who once again jumps in teaching positions .
the coast time is now over , declared class instruc@@ tors Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very ung@@ od@@ ly , because it was a really great time .
finally , I can rely on the quad@@ ru@@ ff@@ lers .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
it broke out with the children great joy .
eight first cl@@ amps are already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what to know the subject now
how exactly is the software update instead ?
is Diesel Driver to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behavior of cars of the emissions class Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the updated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its dis@@ arm@@ ament has arranged the Federal Office of the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced an immediate implementation in the next few months , but still no accurate date .
Daimler has informed , to write any person concerned .
if any inspection is due for an inspection , this will be done in the frame .
how long does the conversion work go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntarily , the car manufacturers do not act on the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be an appointment .
what are drivers that do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE is advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions , where elev@@ ations are threatened .
in rural areas there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel engines .
the ACE is advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize winners under President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically leading .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
in this year , there were also singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the L@@ ear @-@ powered progressive TV series announced that it is worth seeing you to participate in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to dis@@ solve the arts and human rights - even to withdraw them - and that will be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , the conversation with Tr@@ ump to take advantage of their visibility .
according to former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Zentrum is the largest cultural unit in the U.S. capital .
among the previous winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city vi@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s City Mayor , goes to R@@ ente in the next year .
the place already is already written - suitable candidates are rar .
since the age of 31 is W@@ acker City Builder .
and the work makes him still great fun , how he talks in the press conference .
it reports about varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , we ad@@ ore him that no application should be fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for the next possible date an architect or construction engineer .
thus - under respect to the regular period of notice - still enough time for a preparation .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the Administ@@ rative Community as the Lower Building Authority , the applicant must submit appropriate inten@@ tions .
because this function wants to keep the city on any case .
if they don &apos;t want to fill this , they would have to leave the citizens to open up to Offen@@ burg .
but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the town is important to the city and himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker that reports from a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city vi@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is thinking about the office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future , varied projects will be on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ a- and the Lower @-@ Floor parking place .
the chin @-@ up bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the stadium restoration is still subject to issue .
the latter alone will be@@ have some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we really make it right , &quot; W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
the age of age is present for a city @-@ builder big game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dener , it could be very flexible to react very flexibly .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of gre@@ ens will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
as the old town stands as ensemble of monument protection , it is important to have &quot; one eye to do , &quot; if new constructions are approved , emphasi@@ zes the separ@@ ating city master .
the municipal master carries a great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , everything runs here on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) for 15 years .
even though his successor will remain , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain with the place . &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further development of the city .
if you want to transfer Roland W@@ acker , the town of Has@@ lach , a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture , should have a good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and building planning .
construction and civil engineering , construction of urban property , urban property management , urban farm , urban farm , construction and municipal gar@@ dener and sub @-@ building authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on leads thrown : southern track closed
according to the police , the blue bicycle had covered the blue bicycle from the rail tracks in the Le@@ ob@@ ian street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged that the her@@ al@@ able freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and seek them since the night after them .
near the Tat@@ ort , a ros@@ ary roller and bike driver were observed close to the Tat@@ ort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a celebration of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ B spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators brought itself in great danger and endanger@@ ed the train .
in addition to the damages at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ hour traffic and the costs for rail transport could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be guided without han@@ di@@ caps .
nearly ten passenger cars were cancelled Friday morning , two of them consider the correspondence .
freight trains failed , however , they did not delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of surface leads had to be replaced .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ able intestinal disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the inc@@ ur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million euros in the United States , causes stomach tor@@ ch and ble@@ eding , recur@@ ring or bloo@@ dy waste , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ers normally , meat and dairy products come to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University revealed that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins were contributing to develop immune cells that promote an toler@@ ant intestinal epithel@@ ium .
the scientist , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , hide themselves in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to resolve inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells , protecting the tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging the body .
if the equilibrium is circum@@ cised in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
in experiments , there was found that a kind of tolerance sub@@ ver@@ ing immune cell in mice occur , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an mice had their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an in@@ dro@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet is toler@@ ated , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system is effective in humans .
the post@@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched for a kind of immune cell who had found the tolerance as it was found that a group of prof@@ esses such cells had , but it was not separated .
it presum@@ ed that the difference to the intestinal micro@@ organisms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us that normally live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract .
the po@@ orer of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but lacking in mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , so they were lacking a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells were developed .
to understand how the bacteria impact on the immune system , researchers attributed to L. re@@ uter@@ i in a liquid and then led small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to be toler@@ ated by toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabol@@ ism which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ane values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant stim@@ ulating cells like mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect away in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known if Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i developed the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
it said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells are controlled inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ane values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; Genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; Genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der took his debut on Wednesday evening against Samp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed him in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to popularity .
however M@@ atic had been excluded from the Prepar@@ ation @-@ Asia Tour of the Blues and abol@@ ished just 45 minutes , which had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , an gen@@ ius in nature , how he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va &apos;s stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
in this week The Independent disclos@@ ed that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho would wish to wish for three more new engag@@ ements , but it existed that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four main comm@@ it@@ ments .
&quot; three of four have received , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy when they received four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky .
pilots flew in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan , and moved to the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar sh@@ ielding , the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner was to be .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new Low@@ est for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind blo@@ wers : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD head , S &amp; D Vice @-@ President had always been concerned with a certain concern to Berlin .
just don &apos;t distur@@ ban@@ ces from the party centre , just no counter @-@ wind from the Federation - so the most important desire of the election fought .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundament@@ ally .
since then , the staff of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing dism@@ iss@@ ing the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind .
there were deep depres@@ sions .
and one after the others .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal Republic sees a general signal to coalition between SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more : red @-@ green is simply impossible to rule , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising responsibility of the Green Party &apos;s surprising delegation has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the country &apos;s election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ke chief executive officer Michael Kell@@ ner re@@ ur@@ ged the Gre@@ ke T@@ aken Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ke T@@ aken Lower Saxony . their mandate returned .
the over@@ coming of the CDU means a clear disin@@ teg@@ ration of the elect@@ oral victory .
El@@ ke T@@ aken will immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and Election Manager of the Green editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD @-@ election fought , as Friday morning , the new job mess@@ enger to the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without its own governance in the CDU .
it is the preliminary highlight of all the rows of large and small cris@@ es in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the missions began with the un@@ expect@@ edly defeat during the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , soo@@ thing the com@@ rades of one time .
according to the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be otherwise .
this was then , too , and everything was clearly worse .
the SPD in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smoothly .
the com@@ rades looked up again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had straight new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next turn came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ mann@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus on the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he did so quite wrong in the crisis communication , which can make something wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz f@@ ights for its political survival .
now Stephan W@@ eil also still .
due to the VW @-@ gas aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a longer in criticism .
Mi@@ esis were added .
nevertheless , or maybe now , W@@ eil tried to sit in action in the past weeks .
the ende@@ avor of the former Mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , also not been hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they left him , because they had a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
there is no gu@@ ilt because of the parties of the Lower Saxony in the region , however , no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz didn &apos;t even know .
therefore , the com@@ rades stri@@ ve to keep their own ranks closed .
their wrath is directed at the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the we@@ al@@ thy par@@ liam@@ entar@@ aries in the western world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like woman T@@ aking their own career &apos; interests through the interests of all other &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party t@@ ines in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ jack@@ ets won &apos;t be elected to parliament because of their person as a direct @-@ did@@ st but on the regional list of the Lower Sax@@ on parliament , the Lower Sax@@ on dep@@ u@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that it returns to their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elect@@ oral election of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil on prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the German elections to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CDU @-@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election result &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded that clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if you have been more or passed it to the CDU of Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ance of the village III
who would like to san@@ iti@@ se it into the years , can get from the country soon .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ allion City development was received on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again made a review of the previously made .
since 1991 , it has been showing remedi@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thir@@ ds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the sub@@ sid@@ y was still at 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not just new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , one will receive the information of the governmental office in Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the sum amount will be 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros will be received from the country , the remainder of the congregation .
how do a rehabilitation area now arises ?
you will continue to examine Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , there is also a role whether in the planned area in general interest , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial borders may then move again once again .
the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal government &apos;s &quot; Social City , &quot; in its context the renov@@ ations were then carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal cities , improving the living and labour conditions and the expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called per property .
then the sanctuary would then be specified as stat@@ ute .
the authorisation period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year it would only be carried out once again , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire .
in November or December , as possible , as possible , as possible , as possible , as possible , as possible in the coming year with the renov@@ ations .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e will conduct the mentioned pre @-@ examination phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore to evaluate and to evaluate the urban resi@@ du@@ es and to decide when it is renovated , and in what extent does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the property will also be entered in the Basic Law for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again received once again and make a picture of the situation , she said .
Got@@ zel stressed , a significant success factor for the project to participate in the project .
therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires that will be sent post@@ al@@ ously to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the Yellow Question@@ naire is the &quot; Building and Basic Law , &quot; where it is among other things about the structural condition and san@@ itation views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and inhabitants of a residence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; is only available to complete when in the building business premises .
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible to support .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of the funding for the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ bia &quot; function - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ t first .
you could not reserve any promot@@ ers for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the conclusion , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a re@@ development of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself focuses on a micro@@ chip to come into house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even started his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and po@@ is@@ inger and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a advis@@ er an@@ aes@@ thesia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology res@@ embles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts just 30 seconds .
the Company of North@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that it is compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .

the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine Hel@@ icopter for the South La@@ wn as an event that raises the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers after the military , which have been transferred to TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter , which was made in Connecticut , was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South La@@ wn , after the record of the Marine Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of that , because it is an extraordinary event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 , on the eve of the event , wrote to aer@@ onau@@ tical Military Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter met on July 17 at 7 am at the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long until the moon was clear@@ ed between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
note that in case of departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
during the event , the original air crew was at the helicopter , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground while the aircraft remained .
the records provided for the TIM@@ E were not clearly stated , whether a second air crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets are showing that H@@ MX @-@ 1 could be asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we were , whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as whether you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the event , the president had a proposal to reform the health reform that was in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to hin@@ der government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is to request , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into February , as the presidential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of noti@@ fications that can compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential plane due to its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press@@ ure of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to finish the US President in the White House with precise Zenti@@ s .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 practice areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the air crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew over 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supp@@ orter . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were taking on the burden for any other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in order to compens@@ ate the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not provide bud@@ get@@ ing records for the presidential flight , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ve of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D substitute for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of aircraft than 30 minutes from the hom@@ etown of the Navy Corps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs of the operation of hel@@ icop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the refund result is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which include the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but consider the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press operator of the White House , Sean Sp@@ itz , defended the use of hel@@ icop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that in America , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , reasonable to emphasi@@ ze . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he sat down his tour through the South La@@ wn as the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ eu@@ pon with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga enters the ranking of third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blau @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Tab@@ le@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still mak@@ eup balance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga has won the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for his opponent in any case .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in quite similar formation .
straight on the back positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the high North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assign@@ ments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , choirs and Es@@ ben Ol@@ ese , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it &apos;s always difficult for us .
you also need a good portion . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip in the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white might be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment there is still a Fr@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , not the Bundes@@ liga match , the player of the Czech Liber@@ ec player Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is coming to his first use in this season .
previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ dr@@ ens Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White rus@@ sian An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the ATP tournament in Kit@@ z@@ büh@@ el in the ball .
he should also be as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
following his two victories in the past Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again be back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , is not , it will be filled out of the train@@ ee by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the OMV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump not &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when he continued on Wednesday evening his signature under the law to tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast , the law en@@ acted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional laws &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he studied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ ster@@ ing against the US pre@@ mise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft be@@ fore@@ sees European companies to help the Rus@@ sians to build pro@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
appropri@@ ately , investors of the local OMV , co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , are co @-@ financed by the construction of the Russian Baltic Council North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ ills is tremendous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions nor by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons stand for him .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed , which the Group could turn away , and what could be really we@@ ed .

role back@@ wards : the city represents 46 co@@ ch@@ enh@@ ancements
the city organizes the Kit@@ a @-@ lunch@@ time again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a mapping to the team .
the watch is turned back in the municipal nur@@ ser@@ y places .
on 1st September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back into their own .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , head of the department of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs a warm meal in the area of 46 kinder@@ garten , 44 children &apos;s day workshops , 44 .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children at the tables , and the need grow steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are car@@ ed for 45 weekly hours , are explained in the Kit@@ a at noon , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support if children until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 Parti@@ al workers have taken food from the 1st September kitchen service : you will heat the angel@@ ist dishes , supplement it for let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal , give food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a Kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group types , as well as seventh institutions - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the co@@ ch@@ enh@@ el@@ ers are now firmly established to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because also this is about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
direct connection of the co@@ hes@@ ion &apos;s team is to make sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the Kit@@ a , a person who tru@@ sts them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the Kit@@ a @-@ rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen tra@@ itors - will soon be done by special cleaning staff .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen output , it also has the charm that it has set itself in the cost of self @-@ regul@@ ate and fore@@ hand to the city as the most economical , is it from the press office .
and that even though 46 partial @-@ time forces are set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area not so strong to the weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the company , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , official head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women should be di@@ min@@ ed in the Prov@@ inces of the Prov@@ inces . three women kan@@ ers for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the new registered v@@ oters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and belie@@ vable if women participate in restricted and included in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have published threats against an election process that inter@@ c@@ ate with the transition from international hos@@ tili@@ ties to a advis@@ ing role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time passed the power peac@@ efully from a democ@@ rati@@ cally elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent elect@@ oral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered by registered 3.6 million v@@ oters registered .

G@@ MB high concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union with managers of the Bis@@ k@@ uit producer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie would like to make long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has weak@@ ened the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which alongside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities will change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ al@@ director of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that the financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines should not be driven . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concern our members .
generations of families have worked here and concentr@@ ates heavily on the local community and Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in a field with high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosper@@ ity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life management costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently urg@@ ently need a fl@@ oral production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a female speaker of Pla@@ di said : &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ ator at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all businesses that are active in an extremely competitive and uncer@@ tain commercial law , our business continuously checks - and that applies to all our business areas and locations to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . if our business processes are changing at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the side of La League may interest you interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave the persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having received a range of £ 189 million in order to resolve his free pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al cl@@ ots , but they war@@ ned Barcelona three years before the World Record ?
the sensational approach has been heated in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , like Ne@@ ym@@ ar has du@@ ed its way to outdoors , although a source exists since its arrival in Santos , in order to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the soccer world was war@@ ned by PS@@ G President three years ago ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wanted one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not wor@@ ried about having to touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will contact their player , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
PS@@ G made clear that it could not allow it to travel to the International of Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of her price for Ne@@ ym@@ ers .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves on Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse was dischar@@ ged by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atz continues discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the German press agency , he &apos;s ob@@ servatory from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would very serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep sub@@ missions or to express their wrong ass@@ essing the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and compl@@ aining , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio @-@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all practice , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Für@@ sten@@ n Gloria from Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are looking forward to the church and that &apos;s a bound fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their adoles@@ cence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with poor children , as I was , finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , present today &apos;s standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My Bro@@ ther of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the conclusion report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that was submitted to the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer , Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be con@@ stituted by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emo@@ tion@@ ality , the punishment for pupils could even fall short .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other sh@@ ul@@ ents , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , also connect positive memories with him . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report for the failure at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Non @-@ Viol@@ ence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one lifting many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ as and perf@@ ection@@ ist , who did not find a top performance musi@@ cally when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has produced no top performance .
how do you define as his biograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all about it .
he is just eight pages dedicated , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ation or compassion against the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school was also outside of his work .
you can disc@@ lose it if needed too late or first clearly taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which he worked , was inspired by practically all respon@@ d@@ ents - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven , &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus also the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger finds himself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and always provided with cakes , cookies , and bon@@ b@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grapes of children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ying about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional ality , which led to che@@ ut@@ aus@@ ed .
so that he did not just cast with chairs and the key@@ chain on the ground but also ear stu@@ ds and all@@ ot@@ ted guys to the hair or ears , he himself has re@@ gre@@ eted even before years , deeply de@@ pl@@ ating and ap@@ olog@@ ized for it .
however , to his hon@@ esty , however , that such educational methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents like teachers .
do you also know such gro@@ unding methods ?
of course , I think of everyone who was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state school , too .
compared to what is actually in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the privileged excav@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they ask themselves , if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , so many media fell on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him still always e@@ ager@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in the final report any further processing or compassion regarding the load of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : definitely no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ handles claims to have familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never been married to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was really very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , most victims origin@@ ate from welding silence .
if they didn &apos;t familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been working as a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have had been tim@@ ed by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to hold the respective perpet@@ rators .
I get it ... also for really absur@@ d , to accept that out of him ... bub@@ bles emp@@ ire or clear@@ er or even more , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ner , confidentiality , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse has been concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of every fellow sin@@ c@@ ere .
so , it cannot be accused of him to have prevented him or brought him to display .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to this resist@@ ing crime , as it was in some cases .
in the media has been much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into a look ahead in the report .
does he have to live with this cast ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that mixed everything mixed and bl@@ ended on a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere in the middle of the house , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar school , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report originated from the time since 1945 , so also out of four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole hor@@ ri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of s@@ adi@@ ti@@ ary teachers have suffered and mal@@ ign@@ ed , and were aston@@ ished at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where there must be really sc@@ andal@@ ous states .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do ; for he got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
that was , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre @-@ schule &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
you were only happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different about the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : since there was a discipline of discipline , but no s@@ adi@@ c violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report concluded that &quot; many victims were in@@ valuable for the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , even positive memories came with him . &quot;
this way , most of them still remains the fo@@ yer &apos;s throw away .
but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 @-@ 71 when he began to establish itself and from his predecessor at a school , which he did not work and was responsible ( as the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger bl@@ ot@@ ted the ears in front of the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in it he indicates that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the tests will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative rein@@ forcement , he would never drop urg@@ ent .
that was , of course , as a legal clarity , as aud@@ iting in Bavaria , too , were banned in Bavaria .
before that , she took care in a legal fr@@ au@@ zone , like everyone of us still knows .
it was also difficult to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the allow@@ able limit was exceeded .
one can &apos;t say , however , he would always have aw@@ ed away .
this is just not right .
only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ sten@@ n Gloria from Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed to address today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the Dan@@ ger to evaluate moral standards of today &apos;s moral .
there has been the princ@@ ess right away .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was dis@@ ast@@ rous for all times , and not for what happened in pre @-@ school and violence against innocent children &apos;s times , that goes far beyond that back then practic@@ ed .
that is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally done .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipline and punishment , so ear@@ phones and ears to go , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then it was forbidden , it also stri@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Times , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the topic exam@@ ining the speech too ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , told from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played just one side sc@@ roll .
nevertheless , however , I don &apos;t miss any means that he carried out a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there .
but this must also be said : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the un@@ conditioned discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ scription , true cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one gets out of contra@@ dic@@ ting boys to once a big singer and in front of every success , equally discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
as what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , rich belie@@ ving and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something of a fly .
I &apos;ll regularly get to him as many former domains today , 23 years after his em@@ aking , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of their family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , so that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are than@@ k@@ ful today that it en@@ riches their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be , but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful son , to whom they still look up today and they are down@@ right .
and , please , once again : all that one th@@ rows him , are educational methods that were on the agenda then .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this period .
but it &apos;s most ung@@ od@@ ly , a man because it is promin@@ ently and a prominent brother to make a real sin @-@ bo@@ ck .
since it is the wicked intention that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the landing areas would have earned a 93 @-@ year old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even no one could know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
