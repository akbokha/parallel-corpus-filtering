<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards change your views over the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people should face up today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A salftenkapelle, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners produce the single-stiptive reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nervt, if land cards are not currently up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">It knows everyone who had to set itself already because the Auto-Navi took place a green meadow instead of a circumypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the Digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but therefore very alerable.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one knows as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a large picture map for cities and municipalities, detailed maps were incorporated, so called the Priposal leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were originated according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and re-jump of the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French Armed Forces since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave up a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course on military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops invaded the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: today's neighbours, who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern-Card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian" "" "Topographic Bureau" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Grand Primary School of Munich dates back to 1856 and is how many others can be found on the Bayerische Staatsoper's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is the most impressive thing in the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is submitting, which occurs in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after creating the map, in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of shelter focus on today's Plinganserstraße that was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance: in writing a small-piece map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten pieces from the so-called "urge," which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers here today - but small gardener of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Hall of the Oktoberfest, had actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the framework of the present district au-Haidhausen in the area of today's au-Haidhausen, you won't just read the street name" "" "at the gastric dough" "" "or from the height" "" "at the lie" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road, one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irene Institution "was created on the Auer Lüders.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the facility - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for instance the purchase of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is illegal to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circulation system in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum, the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training.</seg>

<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "", "the merchants' name" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the bombs made many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a salmon chapel from the Middle Ages, stood at the Marienhof, where this day will take place and take place on 5 April 2017 at the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">Compare the old Munich-card with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Farms has issued a warning for coloured people, travelling to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks in the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-american travellers, visitors and missions, as a number of fragmenting, rains-based incidents occur in the entire state in the whole country, called it in the position of the Group.</seg>

<seg id="57">It is the first such warning, which has issued the Organisation for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist convictions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline in custody during the journey through the state, and having taken by the police of Missouri in custody, without having a crime of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also has shown a recent report of the Office of Missouri's Office of Missouri, shown in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>

<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would be difficult to enforce a company because of residence or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, who undertake the immigration authorities to compensate people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to further education.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other countries, but in recent days, stakeholders have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Pastor project is elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag named Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the trays department of the family Schwendemann gathered themselves together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his operation in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and equally young kittens and houses in five apartments.</seg>

<seg id="78">In 2003, he acquired the elapal operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the municipality has recognized the significance of the decent project and is happy about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">With cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the oversing of the faces could still be drawn up with all the ropes.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and move on how to continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "" "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often present in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance of the open area is about 40 hectares, which must not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half a leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers stay for 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a good job, without farmers and landing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of a promoter of the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area should not be inflated (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by pressing.</seg>
<seg id="95">Currently the application of eight people with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence at 16 kilometres, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it if they start to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these equally as each other - therefore the sorrows staged by Saddam Hussein's seclusion in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he had a symbolic act with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals to drastic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller doesn't handle the statue yourself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boasting and Liberty-Imitators would have caught him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to, when the celebrated poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta contended: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which lightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to you, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively true, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is a contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your labor, your poor, / thy bedridden masses, who beforesee to breathe freely, / the afflicted rubbish of your rich coastlines."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elapt waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who had to place their words after their death - knew very well that they had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show links between French and American Republicism, in which they exhibited the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a disastrous attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And precisely how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Dihas Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one, but rather an early neoconservative daily that bring the American flame into the converted world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the flickel should not shine the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusually, Limbaugh is cast here slightly.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of statue is quite and simply a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasievant of Lazarus existed in them to see them as it was seen from the exhausting, but hopeful people after long and often horrible travel on the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it's true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective of recognizing Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but the ass, the only source of power is adorable.</seg>

<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or where ever they live or train, went out of space and felt very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="145">The total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for all, from the Domestic Policy to its political principles.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland in Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union impacted it so at the beginning of this week.</seg>

<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">The blocking of those who come on the side of the governor, which is officially referred to as the official forum, is officially referred to and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse has argued the actions of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of Trolles or Spinal-filled people who force the passports.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times, if you have had the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn ators, and to silence.</seg>

<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand juries is to check and take this evidence in potential waste cases and to decide whether the indictment will be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">The Grand juries are therefore also called anchors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the panel may also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to recharge persons to interrogation under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitter CNN, demonstrations have already been issued, which rotate around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meetings were to be asked to a statement, the name was stated in the report.</seg>

<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday night in US television that prove that Mueller should not be sober in his work, and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening continued a speech in West Virginia to present Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1508">You have no reason to accept that something changed, it was named in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used, after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Rausasis, accusations had become noisy according to Trump, he wanting the judiciary to the judiciary.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the West Antarctica, a gigantic Eisberg has been replaced by the barely seven-times of Berlin from the Schelfeira.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometer large coloss is now north and I will need two to three years until it was melted.</seg>

<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, around 30 years ago, there have been a series of unusual coaches of iron shells in the region, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factorial ground.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be connected with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken coloss was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelik.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Slums are swim on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is therefore growing steadily in the sea, and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelote lies south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shrink, the balance of waxles and abruptcy was disturbed by some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scarf is there, writes AWI researcher from Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It would have a lot to do that the Larsen-C-Schelik's danger is in danger, because the front edge did not yet go back as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Furthermore, the ice-board stand under tension and can be destroyed in case of a keyhole in case of a keyhole.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelelt and Eisberg will not increase the sea level, because they can swim on the water and consume as much water as it results in the melt.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shadow leads the glacier directly into the sea, and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, however, only in a small measure, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelelt's Larsen-C-scissors are the fourth-largest lap of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the free ocean, around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "even though it is natural, it is no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield comes in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers are not attributable to the demolition of this gigantic ice rink, in recent decades, the Antarctic Peninsula have been destroyed during the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the drought-recalled conditions and due to diseases-borne, resulting scientists, farmers, trying to find solutions, great headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small spikade, a micro-actertiy, transfers the Zwergzikaden, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And it stands much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not just for vacationers, it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are taken into account, include a better water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of the ground, but also the filling of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state Sinaloa in the state Sinaloa into the state of Sinaloa throughout the organised crime, corrupt civil servants and non-audible drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Discuss two high-level journalists, which feel safe: they are supposed to take their children with the office, who were to leave at home in 2009 or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feeling.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the contents list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no retirement age of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are often more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and then there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and her Inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder, Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest error is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply immersed, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, it depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts to show the smiling face with glasses and its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a Special Tribunal was established to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce they still exist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unlocked and even though the terrain is still slanted.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting on security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know, we don't miss out all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced to leave him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">He drove in his car away, and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the theme of Valdez, there is virtually nothing silent as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlesions, since rivalisms fractions remain here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It is nothing of that in Sinaloa every day one or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of galvanized, two-story moutheen, which is bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a condition of "rest" if only one has to control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivalisative cartel fractions held in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed power-members purchased every copy of the edition when it was shipped to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in which Valdez was not forced to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced journalist for Noroeste, joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to engage journalism without having to crack the noise problem" "", "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters love it to publish hard treffing investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that were able to read stories that nobody wanted to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live more," he said at the time of the CPJ distinction.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"they must take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not want to be asked: "what did you do because of many dead... why did you not say what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun party, like a doer worker, the friend, the generously with hugs and ratings, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guaya, the bar opposite the office, and sit there on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Then ask them: was his love for routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to ask their own investment in question, as they can do their work on the best and staying at life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like you with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret start and landing ways to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of suicide and self-conservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts commit.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, unleash away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the cause with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, not even as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggled smuggled, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, there were no mobile phones allowed. days earlier, spyware that is sold exclusively to governments, used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policeman protection against heat from 104 degrees (40 ° C) sought in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in kidding, some of the reporter asked whether these officers are part of the 50 per cent of policemen who are not trustworthy to the Governor of himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">Since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug subjects de facto have been under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother's former son Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an excposé to the state spending that concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word that who has been abducted or as it happened, so it was careful that everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politician, which belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of fraudulent cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went up to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months previously, the readers of Valdez should have considered the best found source on the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we wanted to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated for the storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something to have expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez spread a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and civil servants say, based on DNA tests that it is.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have been stronger, by organizing them in organised protests "SOS Press" on obedience and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, the director Bojorquez is going to Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">When a meeting with governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to proclaim journalists and to destroy them, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that they were re-divided by the government, because it is concerned that their rage has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly spoken that journalists in Mexico of organized crime, involved in government officials and a uniform society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco-Journalism," "" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling." ""</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "the" "" "Articulo 19" "" "media group has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico, you believe, because they would like to hold the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody is forgotten the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Zetas artist: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones beside her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of Correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue, like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo according to the assassination of its Directors in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly directed to the drugs card with an editorial on the front page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are escaped from their home countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It's a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue work, it's a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, is that the drug trafficking is troubled.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"" "" "" "Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I was reporter," "" "said he." ""</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, as at once all their phones began.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of showeries with belt rivals and security forces near the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the Bordbstones from the on-board, they have published their news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulls close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who held Wache to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they had fear all, they did not show it.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has researchers that describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the gepante plant feeaters is the best preserved Fossil in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, septic.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something, which seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks, and decided to see more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peeling.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it was Slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will go into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant-vores, although it is covered with a armour, and a changing tank is resembles, probably from meats of carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong antipante dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from carnivores, and used a parachute technique, which is used as counterfatting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soak his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealistic opelta markchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of copy enabled it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">It discovered the conshaded, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shaded shaded is common, the results are surprising, since the size of bottopelta is far exceeding the today living animals surviving.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "it indicates that the dinosaurs rejects the dinosaurs of enough pressure by the carnivorous dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation in confrontation as a means of survival." ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals who use the shaded shaded - do you think of Rehe, Zebras or gird animals - are much smaller and infringing than spoil, what signalled that this nodosrier had been exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong crawal behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs Robust have been to have been the Cretaceans," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs rotein was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists will continue to examine the animal on his life, including his preserved Darhaltes, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, came into a river and beyond the sea, where he sank to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conserved wood, but also in three dimensions it remains and the original form of the beast keeps," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of fantasy to reconstruct it. if you only think a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealistic opelta, was chased by the toured dinosaurs of some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealistic opelta was sank after death in the sea and mumiumified.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk at Shawn Mine at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, septic.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the surviving dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely surrounded by the muzzle until hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the chairplanes cared by the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater reimbursement of the dinosaurs keep his armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so good that the skin's vest will always cover hollow tank panels along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, there is such a level of conservation as' seldom as a profit in lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the bewildering will be.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The skin crews on the skin always cover hollow armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken at her heart on 9 August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after having arrived in New York City, sat on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year child, and it is still on the road," "" "it was called there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody had posted information on their feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been continuously retarded at its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live to tweets.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of brownishing body who was outstretched out on the road and stay there for four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," thought Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield drive at the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people who cried out, and of a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording: "Fergusons police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed on which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellate dog.</seg>

<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt packed.</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they were driving on the next morning after Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, the love and the power, the strength and power of resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "as Ferrell with her daughter, who drove a flower-dress and a matching crown" "", "according to Ferguson, they discussed the two a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" "" "about the black experience and black condition." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "remember how I taught you, when black men have to fight for what they believe?" "" "remember what they said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "now we go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them away, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"that's what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know, and it should see it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution, and what we must do to free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have good luck to give you a experience at which they personally don't have a eklatant racism, it is not different than the next black women-child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling, I would have to point out a bad service, to keep it far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, is located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was waiting for an camp as the activists on the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There was Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and halting them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new kind of activism began to accept Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August total," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student NCourse Association, focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all came. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell in the meaning:" "" "do you want to document or tried to find a story that you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Tayan recently declared in an interview," "" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Following the then co-director Damon Davis, together with the then co-director Damon Davis, had already been working together with his activism, who is famous for his activism.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell's project closer together with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are displayed, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">"" "the aim was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is" "" "not around the" "" "Messiah" "" "movement, but around one community," "" "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, like she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in human beings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeated the role of the black swinging women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement which have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must wear the main load of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">Tayan voted to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it exists, however, that "this is no affirmative type of action," by Ferrell based on their identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who touched this energy" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was at the front of the front, because in a life of these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news cameras in Ferguson have long gone since, but the racial links between the municipality and the police continues.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she scammates to a voice and she feels committed to that memory ever since three years ago she went into Ferguson on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size faucet": TV reader discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people, although they are not yet built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south-ending-pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation in 2009 in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold makes the subject hardly one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme will also be discussed at our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build on that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the remaining stores take advantage of which the pedestrian precinct are bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">There is also: the gallery will be on the plot planned on which the peasant market stands, in which 13 directors offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of constructions it will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as well as for Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we've been living in the peasant hall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the virgins are always very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish you, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, Drogerie- or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shoppoints are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the product is fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is also reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, store stores are rented in a shopping mall, because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, there are almost no more and that's what else it is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market place during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration, when the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the FBit-Galerie have already to distribute all the shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it's just not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, nobody is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant markets there is a lot more - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more space anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the Farmers market is broken, there will vanish a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown that are almost inattentive - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupiscus and Haarle sections that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where former secret service analyzer gave a 35-year-old prison sentence after having placed diplomatic reports on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition that was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was only three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could look like using these genomic data, such as someone could look into the formability of DNA data - the many ways, how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been said openly about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison its image was suppressed so that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, sitting in the manning in a driver's seat and a platinum blonde perer is associated with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 'strand Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portrayed the portraits of strange artifacts such as cigarette muzzle and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it, like these people could look like this.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "Dewey-Hagborg had a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were exchanging and replaced by several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic images, "which would like to make a future, in which the President chelated judgment, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published, Manner's release after seven brutal years in Kansas would ask, was a welcome type of prosperous gatherings.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a bit depth at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camps and against Transgender-troops to find new, tweetable ways to handle the rigid splitting, which he should actually fix, further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things could happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the Galerie, the artistic statement requested Manning with their oversized signature, including (the "i" in her family name) an end of "automatic deplating, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg had hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide based on the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what mankind will hope, that our genome is not to take care of what we are, and how it is genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work is from 2007, Spurious Memories." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or inethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumers-boycott, workers fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has been used for more than a year to ensure that staff are aware of the policies and procedures and are a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company's headquarters, a formal complaint was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidal and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said, there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convertible is setting up problems that were previously been hiding in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practicality, were identified and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent provide your software as a service, and will provide the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to take advantage of Venture Capital Investors, supporting both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, where the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzring secured a $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research, showing that today's employees are expecting more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>

<seg id="2246">But the data are useless, if the administrator of a company does not take measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it can have a anticipation that is changing in the way.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he thought unexpectedly.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received the full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>

<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must start their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are funny, but the company deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern rooms have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon, which feel warm, with consciously human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user may also adjust its robots in accordance with his convictions" "" "and thereby select everything, from the eye-color of the robot to the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it will still be calm, since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "that an Stepford-woman would look at progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Snoruppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties, which they are engaging, as for example, counterproductive.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of Shoultice and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," not warms True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So it may like you like it, and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>

<seg id="2405">"" "she can be faint, fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many more serious aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underspicy female properties that goes on a step on Frigid (means here: resist) Farrah is untranquil one on most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it means it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sexist.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement indicate a little darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, don't hold any sex robot, while the FRR remain their rising popularity, nevertheless, they remain at the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leak out of the boundary zones can, in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these high-developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which the White House gives a presidents to attack women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maidservant ') are not the graphic pictures, the hidden bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a great jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots consists of physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, in the point when it comes to their "personalities" the robots have no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or walk away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of total subjection.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human beings</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a Binsenweishness of the Trump-era that the political splits that polarized the US voters and also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankot there were in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to convert with the horror of Trump to be converted.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly committed ourselves to let our filter bubble burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less, the power of Trumps and families have been found.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family since long time visited New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including republican relationship, having fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table, this certainly is a good cause, but it falls into another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by trump, but the durability of his presidency has the power to push them all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grateful way that his cittens will not stumble anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a terrifying long-term scenario, in the Trump Republican of the Right wing, "which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards as an epitome of confusion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's official version of deceased, the dog on the car that had 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - which both occur compared to Trump in fact, as a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump passes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be healthy, in order to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carousel's park, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city, if there is no caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurky and the animals rotate to look at full anxiety about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this on noticeable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés and a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I haven't found out over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not included - but a large roundabout in the North of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, since the two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have received the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to leave the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the Kaufhaus was excessive, while I get tired of experience, to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (Flammable intestinal disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million euros in the United States, causes stomach torch and bleeding, recurring or bloody waste, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferers normally, meat and dairy products come to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University revealed that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins were contributing to develop immune cells that promote an tolerant intestinal epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The scientist, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines are to ensure that harmful microbes, hide themselves in the food, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammation are compensated by cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without damaging the body.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is circumcised in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, there was found that a kind of tolerance subvering immune cell in mice occur, which carry out a certain bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an indroyptophan diet is tolerated, less flammable intestinal milieus if the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a kind of immune cell who had found the tolerance as it was found that a group of professes such cells had, but it was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference to the intestinal microorganisms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus that normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The poorer of mice were found DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so they were lacking a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells were developed.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria impact on the immune system, researchers attributed to L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to be tolerated by tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 percent, but when the tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant stimulating cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect away in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri developed the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">It said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells are controlled inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South Lawn, after the record of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">Note that in case of departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original air crew was at the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground while the aircraft remained.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records provided for the TIME were not clearly stated, whether a second air crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids Federal Government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves on Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse was discharged by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the Missing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatz continues discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after the German press agency, he's observatory from former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deep submissions or to express their wrong assessing the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano," "" "however, criticised that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen with" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be "shameful and complaining," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bio-ethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all practice, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstenn Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are looking forward to the church and that's a bound frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, they pointed out that in their adolescence" "" "punches a completely normal pedagogical means" "", "to be done with poor children, as I was, finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, present today's standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the findings of the conclusion report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that was submitted to the Enlightenment of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer, Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be constituted by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for pupils could even fall short.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other shulents, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, also connect positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the failure at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Non-Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one lifting many students" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it also appears as cholerias and perfectionist, who did not find a top performance musically when a Domspatz has produced no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you define as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all about it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the mediation or compassion against the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the pre-school was also outside of his work.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can disclose it if needed too late or first clearly taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, which he worked, was inspired by practically all respondents - "salvation," "Heaven," and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus also the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger finds himself as" "" "warm" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "competent," "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "" and always provided with cakes, cookies, and bonbons "" "" and "" "" grapes of children "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complying about his perfectionism and its high emotional ality, which led to cheutaused.</seg>
<seg id="2920">So that he did not just cast with chairs and the keychain on the ground but also ear studs and allotted guys to the hair or ears, he himself has regreeted even before years, deeply deplating and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honesty, however, that such educational methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such grounding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of everyone who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state school, too.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and non-violence at the pre-school, are the privileged excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "then they ask themselves, if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, so many media fell on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still always eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in the final report any further processing or compassion regarding the load of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overhandles claims to have familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never been married to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said an concerned representative for the others," "" "It was really very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, most victims originate from welding silence.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't familiar with parents and siblings, certainly not a choral manager, who would have been working as a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have had been timed by Georg Ratzinger (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to hold the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I get it... also for really absurd, to accept that out of him... bubbles empire or clearer or even more, as compared to their parents, internatsleitner, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse has been concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of every fellow sincere.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So, it cannot be accused of him to have prevented him or brought him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to this resisting crime, as it was in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media has been much of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown into a look ahead in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this cast?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that mixed everything mixed and blended on a huge melange from sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere in the middle of the house, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report originated from the time since 1945, so also out of four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of saditiary teachers have suffered and maligned, and were astonished at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where there must be really scandalous states.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do; for he got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">That was, like most witnesses, the subject "Pre-schule" taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: since there was a discipline of discipline, but no sadic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report concluded that "many victims were invaluable for the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, even positive memories came with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">This way, most of them still remains the foyer's throw away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970-71 when he began to establish itself and from his predecessor at a school, which he did not work and was responsible (as the witness) would not hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger blotted the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in it he indicates that," "" "in the pre-school, the tests will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative reinforcement, he would never drop urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, as a legal clarity, as auditing in Bavaria, too, were banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, she took care in a legal frauzone, like everyone of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult to estimate, where the sufferers may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">One can't say, however, he would always have awed away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstenn Gloria from Thurn and Taxis claimed to address today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the Danger to evaluate moral standards of today's moral.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There has been the princess right away.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, who was disastrous for all times, and not for what happened in pre-school and violence against innocent children's times, that goes far beyond that back then practiced.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all awful and I'm glad that it is finally done.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for discipline and punishment, so earphones and ears to go, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then it was forbidden, it also stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what's the image of his Regensburger Times, Georg Ratzinger has played in the conversations with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "" ""? "" "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic examining the speech too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, the Domspatzen played just one side scroll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, however, I don't miss any means that he carried out a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the unconditioned discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world transcription, true cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, one gets out of contradicting boys to once a big singer and in front of every success, equally discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, rich believing and heartfelt people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something of a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'll regularly get to him as many former domains today, 23 years after his emaking, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, so that he was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are thankful today that it enriches their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be, but also a lovable respectful son, to whom they still look up today and they are downright.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, please, once again: all that one throws him, are educational methods that were on the agenda then.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this period.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's most ungodly, a man because it is prominently and a prominent brother to make a real sin-bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Since it is the wicked intention that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the landing areas would have earned a 93-year old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even no one could know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
