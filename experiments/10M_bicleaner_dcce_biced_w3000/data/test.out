a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who was recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ case of a local shopping center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the O@@ pf@@ one said that he could not imagine anyone who would h@@ urt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went back with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lei@@ ch@@ nam , which was founded on Wednesday tomorrow in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ es in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is running .
the brother of O@@ pf@@ one , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , distributed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston in front of his dream job as Koch in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter said that she sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia announced that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that , &quot; things finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a gir@@ l@@ friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said that he could not introduce anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
his way to connect to his family was to bring us something to cook , to prepare the dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of con@@ frontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , what happened in the world , he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he was brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everybody who has the case is asked to call the exec@@ u@@ ary of the SF@@ PD , under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always be put into drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this is how the Hollywood star in an interview was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous clearly .
&quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged in drawers or get off from outside the label which usually have to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself did not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather car@@ ved . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh that they are known as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the act@@ ress is the act@@ ress , at home , fore@@ m TV with embroi@@ dered D@@ ut@@ t and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for White glu@@ t they bring the question after the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as one of the two sons to see two sons .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyr@@ am@@ ids &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered her solem@@ n evening , they were cancelled after home in the quick boom .
one kilometer at this pace , I &apos;ve had fear .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding lessons ended then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament dates - back near horses .
he left with his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , he won &apos;t go on a horse back to photo .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala in the Golden Sports pyramid .
the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete do not win the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Cross of Cross , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed him .
the 18th lau@@ re@@ ates of the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award signi@@ fies me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master@@ minded was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ges and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner of Eber@@ hard Gi@@ isch , Alexander P@@ ush , and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ ff@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , who ch@@ aired Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , who is Ko@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously wonder@@ fully Erhard .
many of these sports activities were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society of the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za @-@ Preis ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ umps &apos; economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential election , however , are the tax and energy policy , as well as in a footprint .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ned as the state of economy cannot harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton to fight the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
by contrast , he himself would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will reduce reg@@ res@@ s mas@@ sively , and he makes a far @-@ reaching tax reform of lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has given dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the sal@@ ons , Tr@@ ump and Clinton tell almost wor@@ r@@ ying .
the democratic applicant announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are traditional democratic politics and are rejected by the state of the Republi@@ can Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ Wing .
thus , at Tr@@ ump , there could be yet parti@@ ci@@ ary discussions .
clearly the differences in energy and climate change are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive coal promotion in the USA .
oil promotion is also possible to be able to date protected areas in date , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton intends to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the sh@@ it@@ ve fish trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade - but just to protect only American jobs .
that should also be paid better , just asked about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is an hunger .
she wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs to say , then he will not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be closer to the control policy of both camps .
on one side Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton is at least , that &apos;s what they want to pay more taxes , and their critics : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every feared woman experiences with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee to everyday life .
when arriving in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
every one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ises with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ ed on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
they sm@@ iling short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene operates normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and among others , dealing with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ eing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ si@@ bs took up the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich &apos;s help .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there is no - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who is coming here , has made experiences with sexual violence on their escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted because of them torture or death , or because their families sent them to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons have predomin@@ ate for the escape : &quot; many are hidden away from it , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , ken@@ ess , hon@@ our@@ able , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
they are push@@ ing them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water is required for a bottle of water , no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that , once they live in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , the standing women would often be considered as min@@ der@@ wer@@ ful and still ab@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 per cent of women who live in the northern direction of the Munich is about 90 per cent .
&quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily developed . &quot;
many women be so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trusted not , openly concerning the living @-@ lived , because the sh@@ am is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since it is often not helping to help , require more accommodation only for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they w@@ ished from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers to no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ al@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated only separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press operators of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some community @-@ floors or own houses only for all women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it &apos;s very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or become men and women together , it can come to - for@@ getting - violence against women come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protective need can be felt at the qu@@ int@@ ent , to read it on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been spoken to us since that , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily move a second house .
assist@@ ants : demands for new working measures
the representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new working measures regarding their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire council , appro@@ ve more workers measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it had been Minister @-@ Bo@@ xes to introduce the wor@@ r@@ ying concerning the agreement .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed to the re@@ jection of a contract , which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who had voted for the election .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC @-@ Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained peaceful &quot; problems , &quot; which was rejected by the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC board voted to fully re@@ ject the proposed new contract and requested the official re @-@ negotiations for all your wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today placed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of es@@ cal@@ ating work measures , beginning of September .
the dispute resulted in this year , assist@@ ants this year was six@@ sm@@ al , the first total incid@@ ents in the history of N@@ HS .
following election to the re@@ jection of the agreed Contrac@@ ting Conditions , the BM@@ A Assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana had been re@@ com@@ promised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the treaty should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hunt , concluded that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to proc@@ laim the hands and proc@@ laim the official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ s in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in Reception , I cannot defend this one of the im@@ print that Ankara is most reconciliation .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
putting Putin &apos;s smile , in@@ alli@@ zed , and he th@@ em@@ bled barely warmth , even for his rest@@ ra@@ ined relationships .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an said , repeatedly spoke about his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times .
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would like that Erd@@ og@@ an would never have happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cr@@ um@@ mers showed that Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian campaign by the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ tered .
Putin made it from and accused Ankara to be back in the back .
this was even bigger , since it was committed by a susp@@ icious friend .
Vet@@ rop@@ ho@@ s re@@ build up again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed , when the Turks would bear gu@@ ilt for everything .
at the serious test , the alleg@@ ations of conducting officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an has benefited their own family of illegal oil retailers in Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he argu@@ ed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of President Erd@@ og@@ an who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an ar@@ mis@@ tice are clear in hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs primarily all the friends who he can get in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his am@@ tes .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motifs .
Russian sanctions imposed Turkey hard , especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late Imperial ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television appro@@ ached fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the west since it was considered a weak response to the attempted state of power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is pi@@ v@@ ety to withdraw from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , Russian leader won a bonus for the chosen national organs in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a self @-@ comprehen@@ si@@ tivity , which even has a deep @-@ sitting afraid of reg@@ im@@ etic .
the summit in this splendid palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as once a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; : two countries , which swal@@ lowed up from the west and then fail .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently announced the role as peace talks , but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides .
it could be surprising that after almost three hours of the first call at the press conference , they said that they had not stri@@ ped up the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey missed it inten@@ tionally to respond to question about its differences while Putin decided to emphasi@@ ze this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator could be found to Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , NATO member Turkey is certainly better that the two Heads of State could not speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced more to a back@@ office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since been dist@@ anced since eight years ago , and had to be saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand cont@@ est@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but is not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alized headquarters and the IPO will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the brand that will be employed by our staff , since we now become more about a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global trademark , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not move his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop themselves to the Bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked yourself ) to make this for a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very angry three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched this brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think , will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ ker Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am facilit@@ ated and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori decre@@ ases the ju@@ bel when he brings to the Pre@@ dil@@ ection victory .
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s achieved a milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth @-@ time D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Care@@ er
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , just few before him .
he has a style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect , which differs from the others in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma thr@@ ills fans for years now for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he would have had 6,000 profits , if he would not only have a weekend and large tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already been almost 30 years of winning players , what is great .
he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but also he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .

from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was ner@@ ven@@ ding .
a whole series of major tur@@ ni@@ es , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survi@@ ves a plane crash and received an ad@@ diction .
at the beginning of three years he had gained difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month sperm , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ activate his branch and to return to his best form .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years .
Russian Putin moist@@ ur@@ izes Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his Chief of Staff , Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s most eng@@ ined trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was named as Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Group .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin made the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidi@@ ary Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later to be log@@ ged and leader of government personnel .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state and insp@@ ections on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin made the Russian TV station on Friday that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked therefore to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the sm@@ iling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious v@@ eins .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time in the most close confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , both men were broadcast@@ ed on television , both men were able to return on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
no one knows no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once became as potential President once , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed to great sk@@ ep@@ ticism once .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V says it is true that I could almost say that at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say this very complicated post - they could almost say - compl@@ aining it for four years .
as it has been out , I have been the Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidi@@ ary Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the position in December 2011 .
he previously was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin met power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people who trust in most .
once , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V would have assumed the second term president of Russia , since a third term of Putin was exp@@ elled against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .

Queens@@ mile Crossing : bridge now connected to fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four resolutions in the &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower , &quot; the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge stage of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cas@@ ings .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
the economic minister Keith Brown was able to visit the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ land cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of engineers from a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the shipment is between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck an hei@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total h@@ ad@@ orable cks in their square and last section of the Dec@@ ks will get a bed for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first clas@@ p represents a considerable milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of ground@@ breaking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the past road section and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck you had to close the still existing gap on the north or landing page .
this was reached by pulling the North Zub@@ ring@@ stra@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very difficult activity .
mas@@ sively , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a gradient of about 3 % .
hei@@ gh@@ ing , as the tolerances , that the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be life &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still be at life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after having thrown down by her fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after the crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swi@@ m in safety while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we watched the boat in its proximity , and set the worst of the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the life@@ jacket of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the win@@ ch saw the boat already away beyond their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted and found on a boat without life@@ jacket .
they all came on board of the coast of Coast , and brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the waters have not suffered , and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ ary stop , however , these sol@@ ves the boat controlled by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has caught today about these men .
severely injured - man inclined to his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man attacked her ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg by a knife and was severely wounded .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to obtain his personal things .
instead the non@@ alcoholic off@@ ender have the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they arrived in the apartment , he turned twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was h@@ urt by the hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed then his sister .
together with their lifetime , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him , however , to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her companions from the house .
they met the ex @-@ hab@@ itation of the man on the road .
when the two women again betra@@ yed the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds all cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens my : investors have to be taken much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how respon@@ ds you to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
primarily about the question : who is supposed to build the favourable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas around 20 percent of all apartments as social accommodations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favourable apartments can however also occur in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large dispute in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build up with investors , who want to build on private spaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 per cent , but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions and is still to be financed for incen@@ tives .
the problem so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the frac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as possible as possible .
the Left wants to increase hardness levels for investors .
Not@@ with@@ standing , as Brat@@ mann , a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is required .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar if we get the skilled workers .
yet the programme is not entirely able : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of further 1300 cheap apartments that will support the promotion in the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ing oli@@ tic speaker Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ out bonds of the city .
in addition , the apartments would have to be remembered once again , to get back into the price .
this is possible in the western city .
one stroke will solve the problem .
because in West@@ stadt are running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is what the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social dwellings in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , the target of the so @-@ called mixture is removed .
a concentration of social weak in just a few days of town shall not give it more .
the green nature expect that there will be more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must go to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this focuses on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating how the world changes .
that Teen@@ ager and Child will not go out for playing outside , but rather to spend their free time , to spend on screens in the last decade of many compl@@ ains .
Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go will therefore be to pick up people from the sofa and be active .
at the beginning , the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on vide@@ og@@ ames and most recently on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities not exclu@@ de each other .
I am referring to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards , and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of the pop@@ culture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users had as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players will go out with their Smartphones for outside and seek Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that were tra@@ cked with a GPS as soon as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the tooth and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of sofa .
in the U.S. the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person ref@@ unded every day .
amid , an app for Apple Watch , re@@ trac@@ ing 35@@ ,000 users , distributed Washington Post prior to the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company does not know who will play Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to help people want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bring about 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are bor@@ ing and bor@@ ing from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
who regularly push@@ es sports , reduces his chances to climb to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of advantages , which is too long to use them here .
but the wonderful to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring about it to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people work on the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ g@@ ous gam@@ bl@@ ers , which must always be compl@@ ying about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should I mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit previously managed to track our activity , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and leave the use with the time .
however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , apps and virtual reality with the activity will be combined in the real world and helping people to be hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the immune system .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less in the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on full line .
and now finally Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ roll title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and the &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ ers sk@@ amer@@ ican in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es will play on the Swedish bal@@ let during the individual campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ championship title , and altogether the fifth , while she confirms their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in t@@ ears , when their final score was shown and their long journey took place at this moment .
this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps that brought up their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ ly domin@@ ates her sport @-@ art , 15 world championship , including 10 gold medals , with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , I ever saw . &quot;
they expected last examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of superior expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful of gold to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ race the number of gold and silver in the single majority of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served on the f@@ are@@ well celebration of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a exc@@ lamation mark .
although Bil@@ it &apos;s in@@ sist@@ ed on the top , never fore@@ seen the future , isn &apos;t it really true .
part of its floor exercises , which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would be home to the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is no co@@ incidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has never lost a campaign competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which becomes long as long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina was easily carried out by two fil@@ ings , the image prev@@ ailed .
pi@@ g beams and dr@@ au@@ tionary - in which it holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ged .
she repeated again with 15.@@ 433 on the Swe@@ eper again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another .
Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished they gently for her du@@ b@@ iting - a pure form of form - and t@@ ears along Bil@@ ly shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once was described in their collective book , to reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was an ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina went .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ ers capit@@ ulated , called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after menop@@ ause , she cast the audience of Egypt , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which is sometimes du@@ bi@@ ous .
as it concerns , the rapidly spreading of 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new significance at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ers in the music sound in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , which were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial k@@ id of Phoenix , while they list@@ ened to the car and list@@ ened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June during the car was par@@ ked , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rator hum@@ bled eight shots from a hand@@ wat@@ ering weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled to read with another car , is read in the report .
the police distributed that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a prey , since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ winner of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings headed the investig@@ ators to become a closer look , whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ isp@@ anic residence within four months and were injured in nine attacks and two injured .
&quot; it takes place in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
it is assumed that susp@@ ects several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to imp@@ ose the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks were tied and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness gave the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting incident recorded on an empty pickup truck to half an hour before the three @-@ day murder and assumed that it was the factory of serial k@@ iller .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ pelin : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his retirement Edmund Optics has made a genetic disorder , the result of a genetic disorder which knew not his mother Elizabeth pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
what &apos;s wrong anyway -- naturally one has left it , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund can never see them under certain circumstances , and that he may not survive once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far , that they struck him to institutional investors .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a remedy .
Edmund was unable to sit up to his third year of life , nor cra@@ w@@ ling , and he still cannot speak .
but it makes slow progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language , which Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing speech , &quot; counted Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ zep@@ pelin has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund and infections with viruses like meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and predic@@ tions can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an unknown future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she hasn &apos;t really know it .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time anymore because I don &apos;t expect that she really cannot tell me any more .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has created a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fier@@ ce ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding the occasion of b@@ ail@@ out in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
fier@@ ce ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forces the governor to call the emergency . it will be counted on Friday through more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississippi River , floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding in extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National weather service .
the Governor of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards made public contact with local authorities and help the help of the municipalities already on the road .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with that the inquiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are shared .
ste@@ els said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service has suggested that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches in rain in this area .
on Friday , an early war@@ n system was used in the South of Al@@ ab@@ ama , while it &apos;s continued in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which both are located in Louis@@ iana , will reach all probability after the weekend record .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could enjoy many houses in the outskirts of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flood desc@@ ending floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , since these rivers run only slowly to Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ti@@ cked fast , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level once again on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 .
rescue ste@@ ams still strug@@ gling people from the floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite districts and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Han@@ s@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ ping p@@ opp@@ y were among those who were saved on Friday near bells .
Han@@ s@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which normally lies more than 400 feet away from his house , overnight by night .
he said that another woman was war@@ ned that , in close proximity , would have been war@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flows into the stream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Han@@ s@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Han@@ s@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 , where they had never seen such a high level of the river .
Han@@ s@@ ford said that he and his family members had had all the abilities and he would be able to swi@@ m .
Han@@ s@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military trucks and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ves where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had rapidly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there continued heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , and the authorities could ev@@ acu@@ ate ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , there was an ob@@ server near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches ra@@ ining .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been substantially completed by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities issued that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa are 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , who were both floo@@ ded now .
the pioneer of the community Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets which were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations have been established to accommodate ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water should go forward , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa were closed almost two dozens of roads due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to keep water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems like to become a similar incident .
in Mississippi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses to Thursday have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday there were no reported .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water at places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; blow@@ out by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week is the second time that a 6 @-@ year child will be shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents performed that Brown has suffered several sh@@ ou@@ ting violations , including in the L@@ ending , B@@ ein , arm and belly , but it was in its transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state &apos;s state was classified as a critical hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the transmitter with that it is expected to recover .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
there were also three men : two men aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was placed on the front of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reported by the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police determined that under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators participated in C@@ BS Philadelphia where it seems to come to a cross between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to different stor@@ ms , sur@@ passed the tat@@ too .
it seems that it clearly un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally acted to a prolonged battle .
on the street , on both sides of the path@@ way , pulses were found .

there were also several homes and vehicles taken in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police det@@ ain@@ es reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a tor@@ ch at the arm , when she played before her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ on and Lau@@ rie
that is what I am in front of the women &apos;s Olympic center in the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s more than a reason .
first I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and second@@ ly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who insp@@ ir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w , and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ oli@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has strongly consolidated the black and h@@ isp@@ anic presence at the top of this sport @-@ art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ as@@ ants a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ on # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ on Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but most @-@ made Gy@@ mas@@ tic routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so we do not see gymn@@ asi@@ tic classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ on and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics were only four teams in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport , and gymn@@ asts primarily associated with parents who are holding their parents &apos; training , travel , travel service , competition and hotel expenses ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs which can support the business .
in these worship , the Turner will receive its full training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower .
we must insp@@ ire the municipalities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ on and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy access to access .
I founded my turn@@ out foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have offered a free and affordable car in Harlem for about 15.000 professionals ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner .
in September we are expanding to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide young high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast , which earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports art .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness of the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for the health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls to be interested , and this is great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
that &apos;s an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ on and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass you mo@@ tiv@@ ate so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong , and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal rejected
the ministers were hop@@ ing to termin@@ ate the argument over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed agreement with the heads of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants decided upon a vote .
in July , Hunt plans were revealed to forced the contract , and said that N@@ HS was involved in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients any further delay .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekly working times to improve n@@ ursing times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , ch@@ air@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for assist@@ ants the last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ ants &quot; have agreed during the proposed Treaty , notably that the current staff mig@@ rant and to be used to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of doctors have been under the new contract must be made adv@@ ances and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A contribute to resol@@ ving the dispute through talks during the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Resistance and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ated silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt had just made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now , lift up the suspension and speak the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
he should not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out more working measures .
the last strike in late April saw an upgrade of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before , since n@@ urses and specialist doctors have been included in order to cover doctors on the track cover .
the ministers were hop@@ ing to end the argument over the changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the presence of British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to provide a better week of week@@ day for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , requested the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures do not reach the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare their families , p@@ ants and their families only wor@@ ries , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ ee of Assist@@ ants and respon@@ ding to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to the concerns regarding the pre@@ m@@ acy and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ling .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - how to return , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , education , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , education , health education and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can reduce heart attack rates
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ itted by a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being recommended by the authorities , to adopt this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attacks for persons suffering from heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or further heart attack .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from a heart attack , or a stroke .
heart attacks and stroke emer@@ gen@@ cies are caused by accumulation of fet@@ ch material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ or@@ ings .
if the layer breaks off , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that caused blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk of having a further risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily taking of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ols Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ tech evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ lob@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively during the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - particularly the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the introductory design is recomm@@ ending any treatment over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves elections in Muslim areas b@@ lossom
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the request of a government statement due to corruption from the Office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led the broad@@ ly common election in Muslim communities , as openly referred to as a non @-@ governmental report today .
the former head @-@ member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es res@@ ur@@ ges the police , election ob@@ tains and Rath@@ ro@@ wers to have igno@@ red evidence of &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former minister of the Integration and Community Government , who now would be a corrupt threat of v@@ oters from religious Mo@@ tives , said that it should be permitted to protect the en@@ rol@@ ment of v@@ oters outside of elect@@ oral cabins to protect un@@ locked v@@ oters to protect v@@ oters .
he recommends that v@@ oters should take a reference to him in order to prove its identity in elections .
at that time a v@@ oters must be called for its name and address .
the report proposes to un@@ removable ink on the fingers of a person , if they vote their constitu@@ ents to prevent one twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official organizations or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for elect@@ oral fr@@ aud , but should also protect the municipal government before the bro@@ ader corruption and financial authority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special selection committee decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be enth@@ used after a lit@@ urg@@ y on corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ aged .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ed the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ op@@ repar@@ ations to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the basis that it is the reli@@ ant duty of Muslims to vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were dou@@ bt@@ ful or a result of a im@@ itation , if one person cho@@ oses one person as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fr@@ aud throughout the country .
in particular , he expressed himself especially al@@ ar@@ ming for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people , choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ ck@@ ish the elect@@ oral system , including the feeding of out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on the protection of some ethnic minorities was exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people , in accordance with the welcome of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ist@@ ani background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns ... state institutions such as such behaviour referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion should never be igno@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist station@@ ery documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ations , requires also tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elect@@ oral directory on immigration and social sett@@ lements .
check options in consideration , v@@ oters before choosing your identification .
do not use remote ink on the fingers of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent one twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person will be carried out to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit to applications on a automatic mail@@ box .
ban that political activ@@ ist can make complete brief@@ ings and envelop@@ es from post@@ age groups .
the police give the powers to establish abst@@ rac@@ tions on voting stations .
a legislation passed by an indictment due to en@@ rol@@ ment in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ gericht@@ tungs@@ gesetz 1983 ) .
photographer offered in voting stations .
requirement that only English can be used in elect@@ oral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of training to ensure that the employees take the rule that v@@ oters will go alone in the elect@@ oral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal charges after Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Election Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy @-@ leading for a lit@@ urg@@ y on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a number of reasons for reason , he was found guilty according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the elect@@ oral registration of the city houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trial in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country is a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud hei@@ r , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and the spread of elect@@ oral fr@@ aud and leu@@ k@@ ation of some authorities threat@@ ening these good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympics in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio are this week over the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot besides the edge and band , which has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ pl@@ anner of the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is not the only one that has had gold fighting Ath@@ os , who has at least his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not when you can give social media belie@@ ving .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that have created the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a lists of Olympic sports that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger , many people appeared on the Internet as a certain she@@ et@@ ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures , where he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness into the social media with and to hear that he had already been listening to Leo on his childhood .
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the visual hair@@ style , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I hate the probably as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more in the centre : the rising simil@@ arity between the British wide spr@@ ingers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is meant as a double winner for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swimming pool Cameron van der burgh was compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Morrison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Athle@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another comparison of comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which shows a similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver medal , Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun b@@ aked skin and blonde hair , such as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans have been att@@ ested , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; was equal .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ arities are also fallen
theory : in the room : according to this user , there are perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user has declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet is th@@ inks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope became Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons are Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her sm@@ iles , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which makes her own beautiful , wide smile , res@@ embles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to set him many as a speech
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .

a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who had hosted the C@@ BC report , live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ olog@@ ize for a swimming @-@ performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , it &apos;s sorry that it &apos;s happening . &quot;

the network was ap@@ olog@@ ized quickly and gave a message .
we re@@ gre@@ t it that these statements were made and that it was possible to make them broadcast .
we met yesterday night in our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lic@@ as in social media .
to clear one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments is related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as person .
nonetheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen wording . Byr@@ on does that which he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald , in the con@@ sign@@ ment and attempted to jus@@ tify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ olog@@ ize for the comment , which I made after the women &apos;s floating in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I laid me on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional , and it was sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ t about woman who sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyer did not know where they should see it when a woman attracted her clothing am@@ id@@ st a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ e the situation , she numbered them as she saw in it , and put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they continued down and tested four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman rehear@@ sed the under@@ p@@ ants before she put back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under under@@ wear , &quot; she res@@ oun@@ ding and the business left her , without buy something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she under@@ took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , with@@ drawn their own ti@@ ghts and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not want to find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - she simply stood there , just like Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ red , when they departed again , having obviously didn &apos;t like her , since they put it to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that her did not feel right @-@ looking and r@@ ush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not distur@@ b that any man watched - or about the person who would buy under@@ p@@ ants under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you think anyone would take shelter to home , who had one another person , and that were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have seen , the staff have tried to draw the garments out of the sale after they went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of shelter to home and find out that another woman had she had her and not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms reefs
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him some saf@@ er .
we talked with Rh@@ one M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move around with armed th@@ ie@@ ves .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how you rot@@ ate your pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you get back from behind , then you should be turned to shoot , so that you can see your attack@@ er and enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sei@@ ze the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder , before you beat him with your free ell@@ bow .
just beat him so with the kne@@ es in the l@@ ath and turn the weapon out of pain . beat him out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move forward , while they prepare the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , sei@@ ze the weapon and turn it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er onto the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving forward and arrange the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video on to see exactly what it makes M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ power .
but remember that it is a saf@@ est in the saf@@ est way , your money - if you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright don@@ ate for a guide to his tongue at the dirty locations of Europe
a British Reis@@ s under@@ went his immune system and appreciation of a serious review by taking some of the most dirty and most not@@ orious locations of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel @-@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk depos@@ ited his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ ker at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge head of a pulling and public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before demo@@ li@@ tion of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is in@@ let .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought , inhib@@ iting the r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a pulling toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , can indeed be completely sho@@ ck@@ ingly , but actually , in a kitchen sp@@ icy more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health .
fortunately nothing left , what he de@@ filed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been well @-@ known to test the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world , and ate great things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train heads to r@@ amp@@ er heads of toilets , the task force his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and slu@@ dge waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was righteous to his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his promot@@ er showed a lumin@@ omet@@ rics of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res count is fresh @-@ washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a rus@@ sian toilet , which he refused to refuse up to 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different locations like the bathroom
in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst that I stopped in a toilet , close . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;ll find nothing here , because it &apos;s inside the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company pays Mr Wright with vali@@ o ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explains the advantages of Pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we led the crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which thus ended that we spoke &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
it claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of speaking about the products , we wanted to put it into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment that is associated to the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense for hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the movie by the film , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have said some of the things I had instruc@@ ted to l@@ ore him , as the ec@@ lip@@ sing Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring it , and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of this dirty tre@@ ats on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all survey@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent reported that they contain at least occasionally products that contain added l@@ actic acid bacteria .

Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast upon a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after having been for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , sho@@ cked staff of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls de@@ fl@@ ed holes , wooden legs were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was for@@ ged to the walls .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration near Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it is not afraid to repair the apartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to take into account because this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that had joined the family had joined a street fight with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , tra@@ ys , drug traffic@@ king , drug traffic@@ king , drug traffic@@ king , drugs , and flu@@ kes .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found
it were destroyed in the estate where drugs are traded in the past drugs , the wood@@ working targets were torn
neighbours said that they saw them on the road and regularly embar@@ ked on the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing car@@ ved them and their partners this week violent by the property after having given them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
the dol@@ ences were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , who said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they sh@@ ook any@@ body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - we are not lived !
now , where they finally are gone , there will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had been dealing with the local authorities to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
gar@@ bage and old toys were desc@@ ended on the revised side of the community house .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it was given to take the ten@@ ant to take any responsibility for their behaviour and to her family , since a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case , since the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions to watch their neigh@@ bors aw@@ ful .
I reck@@ on all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , and members of the community , who have cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the development of some neighbours consol@@ ing will don@@ ate and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , left in one of the bedroom of the house after the del@@ ist@@ ing on the ground
workers of the house administration will now have to we@@ aken gar@@ bage , which sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid on the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis and orph@@ an@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don received a fine , after having found herself guilty of a drug of psychiat@@ rist of class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee sk@@ el@@ don , who came to live in a car accident in 2013 .
having gone without Ob@@ d@@ ach , Tan@@ ya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are ten@@ ant to keep r@@ enter , which do not comply with the assignment
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police distributed that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , which do not comply with the classification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is thinking about those who can take themselves without self @-@ acc@@ us@@ ations and those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti@@ social behavior which continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our congregations .

Donald Tr@@ ump spati@@ ally spati@@ ally reduced the tremendous problems ″ in the campaign fight
leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states of federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weakness of his campaign campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the normally @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ el@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ d@@ ents reported .
after having thrown out 16 ri@@ vals within the republi@@ can camp , he now grow dou@@ b@@ ts about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before Evangelical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can floo@@ ding sh@@ ack@@ les
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ s from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors passed by Democ@@ rat , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia can also be regarded as endanger@@ ed .
in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump respon@@ ds to the question how to re @-@ stop the advance of Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I have made it so far . &quot;
and if leaving : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was in@@ sufficient for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was okay , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is to st@@ ain off funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better exchange values .

&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will conduct an assessment , named it in a IA@@ AF Declaration .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and signed as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ge , the sample given and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the Ac@@ cred@@ itation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .

the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in front of the summer playing in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before Olympia @-@ Start .
subsequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control with the WA@@ DA rules are .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
in a series of television report by ARD , the ARD has always been raised again that in Kenya D@@ oping funds is easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
at least , IOC member Richard Po@@ und demanded a similar examination in Kenya as he had set them in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby , it could prove that this sport @-@ art has been comprehen@@ sively and systematically .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

because the government had already covered extra@@ ordin@@ arily high bur@@ ge@@ ons with criminal cases , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey have been on the run .
after the failed put@@ sch the sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ able ethnic Turks were added .

because stup@@ id as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and ground combat combat - which is taught .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the cho@@ ices , are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are on the country , on Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so do not choose the country .
these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , plac@@ ards , ballo@@ ons infl@@ ated , fl@@ yers are distributed and ru@@ b at the end of the vote , only lab@@ eling .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be able to take over themselves on the end of the people .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about to be a bit : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
since 1998 the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting is exciting , like strongly new@@ com@@ ing AF@@ D , and remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tional aug@@ ur@@ inal .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous elect@@ oral campaign , one sees a major campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he travels through the country , spread the ros@@ es , and pl@@ ets a little with the people , as it did his legendary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; predecessor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ ame of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We do that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerates the asc@@ en@@ sion of sp@@ elling points , which will cost him probably the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidates , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how to make a wrong time at the right place of election campaign .
she has invited Angela Merkel to his documentary film Angela Merkel ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ burger and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lam@@ inated Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is also no eman@@ cip@@ ation from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU largely aband@@ on market conditions on market conditions and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
that , so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has ground@@ breaking the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the Left , the SPD , the green : hardly exists in the country of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU election strug@@ gles to his fellow : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go there , where there is we@@ ary , where people are : Dor@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign .
in the surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just under the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD still won at 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , thir@@ ds the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holidays @-@ time and lay out their elect@@ oral campaign to the internet .
&quot; online campaign struggle , &quot; says the state @-@ president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green election strug@@ gles to search for local stim@@ ul@@ ators among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ did@@ act cre@@ atine just , with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg Lake lakes , and also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ties .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end at 20 a.m. , there is always praise to praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made quite a little bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a superb team .
there is no off@@ ence .
the construction site could be moved to the south on the weekend , until the end of October will be ready .
the opposite will also be responsible for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ein@@ ises .
since the construction site is on Monday to the south , and the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abol@@ ished and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was once again , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now go back on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
foreign traffic through the place seems to return .
&quot; there were some significant dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the deputy chief executive manager Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ k@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ser@@ en@@ ings sought and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ posts .
what led to that man@@ cher trucks in residential areas sold in residential areas .
since the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not stopped , the municipality intensi@@ fies the measured vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable consider@@ ations , &quot; says King who made yourself well on site about the location .
there have been two to three per minute .
the high speed was on the pace at 77 kilometres per hour in the pace of the pace .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become a qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that is open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to the street again .
business@@ men do not look forward to the maps .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation company has led to them in turnover , everyone that asks to look .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most gro@@ unded are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
that is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about each Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the increase in sales rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road im@@ bur@@ sement began its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his co @-@ workers have to be dismissed .
when I had been a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt put on an en@@ quiry by G@@ öh@@ ner to give it a financial compensation , the hospitality benef@@ itted from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they are also the dis@@ advantages that contribute to the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other coun@@ ties , where something generous has been handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to continue .
finally , the family company has been located here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history of history .
that other regular guests can now look less often for the complex traffic management less often , he can understand .
if you cannot drive , it is also beautiful elsewhere .
that his master kli@@ mb@@ el returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner does not have any doubt .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced its guests in their long@@ standing history .
six months of constructions , that &apos;s already brutal .
the name of the terror attacks on laws is constantly exposed to laws .
after recent proposals , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thic@@ ker security package .
but what has an Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the gath@@ er@@ ings .
all his suggestions are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior during the presentation of its new security package .
they call for anyone .
others , further points would be discussed within the parties .
I also thought about it .
but the interior minister , however , had given him results , and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
following recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before completing his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
now they fall , however , more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new Security Agency is to worry about the Kn@@ owing encrypted communication , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives on passenger information and ar@@ mis@@ tice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reputation after more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities are equally surprising .
partially , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals to date not to do with the SPD : he wants to leave sympath@@ ie@@ vement for terrorist groups under sentence and heads with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ Mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also hold this yet for reasonable and challenging anything , what does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
this is partly in itself : he plans quick proceedings for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people in front of deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should let their smartphone ch@@ ill their smartphone and open their social media accounts for security testing .
during the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such that off@@ ences , or disc@@ ard their papers , to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally married .
man@@ ches also acts un@@ balanced and leaves any questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of commem@@ oration for example - the question arises : what actually has to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère tells us to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be in case of speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and W@@ uer@@ z@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers were wor@@ ried about security .
and things , who had pro@@ found the people to deep@@ en themselves in turn@@ out times also in turn@@ out times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
until the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertain@@ ty is great .
and yes , there are election competitions .
the Union and SPD focus on internal security therefore increasingly in the position .
in the past few days there went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky stri@@ fe over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Unions of the Federal Minister , in which the Ress@@ orts also demand a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and demand a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also lab@@ orious here to reconc@@ iled sounds .
from a return of the double pass , it does nothing .
we have mastur@@ bation the discussion in Germany .
they newly opened , unless you make sense .
and with an Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he declar@@ es un@@ constitutional concerns .
whether his own package at all corners is un@@ fixed and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself .
it &apos;s a lot in what could cause contro@@ vers@@ y .
however , the SPD also attempts to pro@@ filing the topic of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a c@@ auti@@ ous talk to talk and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , Volkswagen is still g@@ lim@@ iting .
despite diesel vehicles , the delivery figures climb worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
with the respon@@ ding reaction there are ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e around a no@@ tion .
Volkswagen starts off deliveries in the second half of 2008 .
despite its many brands and many well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car park can continue to present an increase in spite of its many brands and several well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the VW &apos;s core brand , especially in Western Europe , moved back to the overall sales , such as the company in the D@@ ax .
sold in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , sales are the second most important market , sales up 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany dropped the deliveries by almost a si@@ eve .
head of head of Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann recorded the we@@ aker numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British v@@ ot@@ um suffered from the EU , explained a female speaker .
in the USA , where the exhaust air aff@@ air first es@@ cal@@ ated , is also a min@@ us@@ k be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the first affected domestic stamp of the Lower Saxony was further strengthened by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 % to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is required .
sales of the Group Fred Kap@@ pler took over a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen has delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for about 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting in workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW , that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , it will show no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the customer is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was named on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen intends to now expand its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has been confirmed by the Federal Office of Office at the last Monday VW @-@ Representative Office .
from the traffic department , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the editions of my In@@ quiry commission and the KBA complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has adopted the warranty that , in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after upgrading no deteri@@ oration , and all typical authorized vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in company circles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is the opportunity for example a half @-@ year after conversion approximately with a motor h@@ urt in a workshop - and this will result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in customer interest , it is important to avoid that it comes with some other damage , which does not have anything to do with Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal , as regards possible warranty claims , as it was called .
therefore , VW uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal charges - as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sales director Josef Paul stated on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on plaster or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal : normal austerity must not be afraid to pay for their austerity policy . &quot;
bearing banks cash over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent criminal charges .
these charges require the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on plaster or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost of € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has covered 40 million euros that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other , and that he could not understand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are upon me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 percentage costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot put 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
he now exp@@ ense the costs after the cur@@ sor principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash just in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four transi@@ tions , I do not feel the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers should have understanding and sel@@ dom based on other platforms .
only a few mig@@ rations to other banks .
the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone would be able to bear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational economically permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal charges for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian national and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country has been made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Federation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t expect that private clients must pay attention to deposits responsible for deposits in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker spoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kli@@ ent@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose wealth is slightly lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a small bank for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they be@@ ware for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank of G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ m@@ uth , and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no other banks known to calculate compensation for deposits of private customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , proclaimed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going neg@@ atives is very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the immigration from investors to competition .
customers in Germany are not able to disc@@ lose that in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who are buying a Schall@@ platten ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before joining the commentary , in order to ski@@ p him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ non @-@ sam@@ ic men of men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the most comprehensive re@@ formation of Schall@@ platten is not looking forward to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who wants to welcome the curi@@ osity of physical objects but to the mid @-@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who have purchased a record recently , are all prec@@ urs@@ or after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer .
it is also no hor@@ ror by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional significance : older platform buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do you vote for You@@ go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow a news report on television , I would carry me the camera while I live in a s@@ vi@@ able road in S@@ oh@@ o , before I ste@@ al , my hands stop , my hands and some Bes@@ tim@@ est@@ ly say : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly coming to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the building where once independent S@@ eller are located - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic land@@ marks .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( Data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men mean age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and go through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I already conf@@ essed , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not having followed him home ) , clo@@ ves the walls of his dwelling .
the reason why he has such a si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not aff@@ ord , when they appeared to buy them young and ple@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably some young to buy it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I &apos;m drinking very much .
that is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets with the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old sheets again .
of the conversations which I have led , people usually have de@@ filed their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their albums sold to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom in the record @-@ up of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it only takes some seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to reco@@ gn@@ ise that record stores a soo@@ thing community of balance minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older client participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to pull up the stability of trusted sound effects , by objects whose happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings will wake up .
&quot; I think it can be the col@@ t of a empty or the possession of material property as a sort of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so many people so .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ orders a staff of one record company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M revealed in April that nearly 50 % of the people who have purchased a record last month , they have not yet heard .
the survey was also found that 41 % have a record player who never use it , while 7 % of those who have a record , do not own record players .
at this point of the news report I would probably look very wor@@ ried while I pet@@ als through a st@@ acks of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ z .
&quot; somebody came just recently and said , &quot; I own no record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so I would like to put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musical las@@ es .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who will grow slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost an entire floor , has a b@@ lower public as I clean@@ se .
there are couples for the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ packer Pop instead of the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ingly psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to det@@ ectable if you &apos;re standing next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and viewed the Vari@@ et@@ rics for the sale of disks .
it doesn &apos;t make a display man@@ ne@@ b@@ um@@ mel as a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve much , hence the collecting of sheets does not make real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a rep@@ ellent S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , of which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers should be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the ticket to sample the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observed one group of young teenagers , group@@ ed up for a moment to pol@@ ite polari@@ zer cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .

French Court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , sett@@ le down .
during a trial period , the authorities in Cal@@ ais have argu@@ ed that the state should be ready to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ al stores , in which persons offer or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places were ra@@ ined because they would not be a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid , and that will hide a fire and low risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court whose shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by nation@@ ally supported association and other groups that would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need of time .
a court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the deportation of people who operate the 72 provisional shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants will play a much bigger role , than just people live , which live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet du@@ es between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ ant was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , the non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , in English and French courses as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of protection @-@ needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure of these children were a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants are estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jung@@ le has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new ank@@ at@@ res during the summer .

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must set up the next generation speed sensor : in different states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es will be tested especially effective .
the futur@@ istic real en@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic Company from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accident areas , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway buil@@ ders or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary speed . there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ under for adher@@ ence to the speed limit .
a lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the en@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data is encrypted via modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be collected simultaneously across several tracks .
variable speed limits , as well as departures after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly dangerous condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturers with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in this way , it is not just st@@ owed , it is lowered in measuring operations , so that the wheels will disappear in the sli@@ ders , by the way also van@@ ish external sl@@ ur@@ ry .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the bl@@ aster front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ es with the new technique : the latest has France 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
United Kingdom takes silver in 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ bit Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , re@@ trac@@ ing , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist@@ band of each color .
the defeat was failed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the Silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall to her in the final .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji could be defeated in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a consol@@ ation for Britain - but it will probably not be - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago , she lost any play among the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost one .
this f@@ lap is we@@ ar@@ ed , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks against the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when it was running in running b@@ usses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au entered the corner .
in another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner that he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly attached the ball .
a beg@@ inner hit by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann @-@ Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua found a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ tire and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ viewed by another weak t@@ ack@@ ing of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it is so , when Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learn there .
it is so also .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through a brilliant mid @-@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran long in favor of the South Os@@ se@@ sul@@ ate , whose fans ro@@ g@@ ging and dances at the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ el set the i @-@ Bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ f@@ le emb@@ ell@@ ished Fi@@ j@@ is emb@@ ell@@ ished and GB k@@ ick@@ off cr@@ ushed in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 Britain and the UK ur@@ ged semi @-@ fin@@ ite match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one goal among the post in the second half .
a brilliant , late T@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside teams secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the coach to the rowing win
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres Gold as with these games and I want to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ie@@ ve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though , only the con@@ serv@@ ings were sitting at the ru@@ d@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was one of her second Olympics in succession , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid down such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9,@@ 500 is un@@ stable , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ os , who slides over the surface with the elegance of fl@@ yers , which does not reflect the species of the triumph@@ s .
behind each gold in the herd , a batt@@ ali@@ on is willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental adv@@ ances that make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the trainer , which would not survive this day at all , when cancer was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , He ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did so .
if you do not do it , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
a little bit has changed .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014 , outside the season , starting out what the inter@@ ruption is to a minimum , if such circumstances is at all the right term .
I needed money , therefore it had to go better .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and went on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater .
in the in@@ consistency of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who tried to speak a ner@@ ven@@ ding morning to process something more than otherwise , to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal artill@@ ery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional w@@ rack . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means that much . &quot;
it &apos;s repeated how much , how much I and Helen , how much I and Helen , too .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could have no better person for exercising or wish you a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to start , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen cried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unle@@ ash in the process , lasting in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s really important to rip itself away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making a little bit .
we didn &apos;t want a fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
next week , Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding , their own with the TV adventures Steve Back@@ shall .
now it just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have been much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to compreh@@ end that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years in advance for clarity :
the Managing Director of the Water Pur@@ pose Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian wide exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water ear@@ box as an example for the great water producers .
thus it was named a few days ago in the original part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken accused the Ken@@ nel @-@ association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group led &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twen@@ ties Association , of which 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired from the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose of the v@@ ault group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants annually .
member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current ch@@ air@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed as Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ nel Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they extend from the water management construction and maintenance work about office and organisation activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency paragraphs on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , they called up the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the development of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ modelling of a central computer system ( 2004 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not given a stand@@ still and I &apos;ve always accepted innovations because water rep@@ ute and drinking water the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her lau@@ dation , she sang Gö@@ ll@@ ers &apos; loy@@ al , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has been employed with a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose and he has lived in water @-@ purpose , as it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago , he was a real practition@@ er to present the success concept for the nit@@ rate group in front of the Water Forum in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller sang pra@@ w@@ ons Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful pop @-@ up .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as the highlights from his view@@ point , he described the well @-@ building and re@@ structure of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , the cr@@ ushing at the high container in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to pass through , that the towns can be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained only because they filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water cover was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will follow the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ rebel@@ ko goes open to the auti@@ sm of her son Ti@@ ago - and is addressed to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease has been recognized with her son , they have believed , they die .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago came to be well @-@ forward and therefore privately held private in New York where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to give an example , if I wonder what two years ago when I sang about the Milan Scala , he remin@@ is@@ cent of nothing , &quot; said Net@@ rebel@@ ko . &quot;
but he is the most lucky person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ rec@@ k@@ os connection to the bass bar@@ itone Erwin Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Mann push@@ es to life vulner@@ ability
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) was shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man hath called herself in us , and given to have his life companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a politi@@ cian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender be on the run , after him will be publicly traded .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , musc@@ ular , brown and has a gl@@ itter .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it &apos;s a few years old .
meanwhile the man bears a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in itself , the police force .
who sees Sven S. , will call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the police in Lübeck initially wanted to do no data to the T@@ ather@@ gang , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it &apos;s a k@@ ill@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a political scientist in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a Spezial@@ einsatz@@ komm@@ ando ( SEK ) was found at the tat@@ too .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the risk @-@ explo@@ ited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of altitude .
financial de@@ bur@@ dens resulting from the industry from the Green electricity promotion are threatened by the table .
the Liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German Steel Industries , the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said : &quot; Western German Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday &apos;s Edition ) .
&quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission has initially planned to use steel manufacturers to use the gases from the oven for power generation for its own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to German industry association , the steel industry threat@@ ens additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , now a basic certificate with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators will be replaced in steel structures , an EEG monitoring of 20 percent will be replaced .
but also this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for its electricity generation .
thus the status qu@@ o of the previous regulation is largely noted .
special significance made the successful painting of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stahl &apos;s Future &apos; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Emis@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers from financial crisis since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , when the world &apos;s largest producer of China produced in view of the we@@ aker world demand in the world market .
European manufacturers are throwing China &apos;s steel concer@@ to price du@@ mp@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on impor@@ ter ste@@ els , for others the economic prospects in China spread themselves in China .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar , as sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
last@@ ly , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de lo@@ ckers of individual works .
around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , like the steel association steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity returned from the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is around two percent below the previous year .
the association calcul@@ ates in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
Community , Spirit , Health : sing and Sen@@ iors good
S@@ ingen Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s teacher she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and overall alive , she says .
so , in doing so , she does something good in doing their health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ers from the German senior League .
most sen@@ iors singing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes Hack@@ ers .
through regular inter@@ iors , social contacts can establish and maintain .
for frequently , social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrange and organize , to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of con@@ sen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , h@@ ack@@ ers writes .
they train a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever ur@@ ges his l@@ ungs regularly , is not so quickly from the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors @-@ organizations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher importance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , themselves en@@ demic human beings for long @-@ lasting events .
in addition to the singing , a special performance is demanded , L@@ enz explains .
simultaneously , at the same time , focus on your own voice and to adapt to the other singers , which is a great co@@ gni@@ tive challenge .
just older people who live alone , prac@@ tis@@ ing themselves , do not only concentrate on self @-@ concentrate .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gement of the singing through singing in the choir , h@@ ack@@ ers writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will better and grow out over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with the singing , there is enough .
who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent , s@@ own L@@ enz .
one does not sing alone - with 50 sing@@ le@@ gen@@ ds people , who list@@ ens already when a tone goes to it ?
in search of suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says Hack@@ ler .
if anyone s@@ ings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle in a retirement home , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
who would like to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ al chor@@ us , may contact the church or church leaders .
many veter@@ ans can also be found via the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours must ask help in the Internet account .
who desire to sing , should always join a choir , s@@ own Hack@@ ers .

biolog@@ ists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the effect of cat @-@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
too her surprise the Mi@@ ow also didn &apos;t let the males go cold - but kept in the difference to the females always immediately .
female cats may recognize the no@@ de efficiency of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on the r@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in big dist@@ ress , as researchers from the veterinary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
tom@@ cat also react to the k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - though , however , always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ tig@@ ation of less and strongly @-@ reg@@ ained vir@@ gins for the males either cannot perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ ship of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry is different with the ur@@ gency of their assist@@ ants .
a total of nine adult males and eight cro@@ ws were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were pre @-@ played for a ru@@ b of little ones that were taken out of the saus@@ age for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger f@@ itt@@ ens , which were also raised in addition .
the researchers hold their findings in spite of the low sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own young , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ o@@ ding .
they turned away qu@@ icker to the loud@@ speakers when this calls of the very angry k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be bor@@ row@@ ed or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males acted at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises .
also , some studies showed that women react sensi@@ tively to mamm@@ als , although they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes place with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has issued an arrest warrant against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important soccer game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is unique : &quot; business as usual &quot; is predicted .
already in July , the government post@@ pon@@ ed the government , the daily life of normal brush@@ ers should not be imp@@ aired .
this , however , does not apply to those who are suspected of being responsible for the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
this is not done before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sou@@ k@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , in America , South Africa survi@@ ves , become a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r shall be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt on President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although this is still valid for 90 days , it was still valid until October , indeed , in fact , it has the life of most Turks , however , as good as no imp@@ lications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has ended Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split up in trailers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but in view of dramatic experience in history , the Gro@@ s of Turks , is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
since there is even the fans - no matter whether your heart strikes for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; it is especially arriving to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne worth its sporty value below : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first play as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ loy@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best on the square . &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season of the record champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the lions &apos; whel@@ ming the lion &apos; in the Europe League .
in the south of Li@@ g , there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who played the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ tor@@ ment@@ ary .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
following the signing of the political situation in the country , the AC Florence had already announced their decision to return to Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce the stor@@ ms round about one @-@ third of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man &apos;s salary is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was blo@@ cked twice because of Dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - V@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led light @-@ tics @-@ sinners can only lau@@ gh - they fight in Rio by med@@ alli@@ ons .
the subject of d@@ oping is determined as before the head@@ lines at Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had to be stopped after a d@@ oping lock on her start shortly before the games , was excav@@ ated and hat@@ ched on its start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with a su@@ ed smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
when it was established that they should not receive gold , the audience broke out into a tower @-@ storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite d@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old one is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
it was blo@@ cked for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion goes even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ s@@ quad@@ ron / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world championship in 2010 had to be a six @-@ month lock after you have been documented after taking the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had a strong t@@ ooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ends .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disc@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the 2012 Olympic champion of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship , was positive in the prohibited stim@@ ul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the wis@@ ely taking and was blo@@ cked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold@@ smith @-@ tin .
La@@ Sh@@ awn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means to penis enlargement should have been responsible , bor@@ ing Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man so far .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hamm@@ ers , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been recognized so many medals .
in this year , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title for nine years later , after having as@@ cer@@ tained testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to play Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ op@@ ings and EM @-@ Title for 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked third on the ranking of the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world records of the world ch@@ anc@@ ellor and Gold@@ sp@@ ori@@ tin was only tested positively in May .
on the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Championship , references to taking a prohibited food supplement could be found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and started off on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - multiple dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered snap@@ shots and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left the hospital .
her home trip is scheduled for early September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on the vacation island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ ho@@ d are also affected Austrian citizens , is not yet unc@@ le@@ ar .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in permanent contact with local authorities , such as be@@ ating .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday night .
according to police , police officers were killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two spr@@ inkl@@ es went up again , and a further human being was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion in the morning .
at the det@@ onation close to the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police data .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded by an urban staff .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air , according to the authorities in a flower bed .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and along the South @-@ South Coast several injured .
in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks apply the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ en@@ eral Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it concerns a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself to possible mo@@ tives - probably do it be the actions of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to reco@@ gn@@ ise a pattern that is typical for bom@@ b@@ ings mus@@ li@@ mic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police stated that the assassination attempt in relation to Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the official sab@@ ot@@ age which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bs of the forces of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days , the authorities could have been informed about the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the locations .
let us be unc@@ le@@ ar , which group behind the attacks .
the police arrested its officials throughout the country , safety around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge any tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ ib@@ ol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to reason @-@ reason bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to aff@@ ord the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) used for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ das and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , most of them are not recommended in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday stayed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this spati@@ ally influence the military influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta b@@ oss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos while the country moved towards stability , moving the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloo@@ dy troub@@ les , keeps himself good to have the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not have succeeded in getting armed insur@@ g@@ ent insur@@ g@@ ent reb@@ els in the hands for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago in Bangkok , in Bangkok , there were killed 20 people in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most blu@@ epr@@ int of younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Identi@@ fying Movement &quot; is in the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several offices , the Constitutional Court also contributed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ fication Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for ende@@ av@@ ours against the freedom of freedom of democracy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , migrants are diff@@ usion from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore , we watch the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ fication Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ coming . &quot;
Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ fication &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely align@@ ed with the offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ fying Movement &apos; attempted to pick up their target group where she stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally speaking , extrem@@ ists try to speak with adoles@@ cent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the inv@@ aded Islam@@ ists as well as legal trem@@ ors .
this is not bet@@ u@@ able advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should appeal the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last , it was given from several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to AF@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type may be relevant only from a certain point .
it comes on whether the respective party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes the objective .
decisive is that , whether such individuals have a permanent influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a look at the significant increase of right @-@ smo@@ ked criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would still not speak of new right terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that there can be jus@@ ti@@ fying structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite , that further legal groups or small groups form , attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , planning against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing mis@@ tic mo@@ tives .
however , a Germany or wide control of legal ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
in addition , Ma@@ ate expressed himself that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who had previously not entered into the right scene in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ects for attacks on asylum accommodations are previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated criminal off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which were previously in@@ different with legal experts , who were perhaps voted politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Left , however , have been radic@@ alized by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

not always determine the Olympics or World Record Head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly over@@ crow@@ ded s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that it was no longer to see in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
Hab@@ te was subsequently used for viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it in the social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just spor@@ tive figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates to the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special @-@ start@@ age from the international bu@@ oy@@ ancy association .
this is distributed to making swimming in sub@@ tle countries of well @-@ known countries .
since there are most athletes running , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ name began the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , there played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care for media attention at the Olympic Games in 2000 .
unforgettable was the performance of the bu@@ zz from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a fo@@ rest@@ ation over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone .
Fr@@ en@@ etic was fired at that time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swi@@ m eight months before Olympia and had never had a long distance before the competition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation the bus could not leave the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six life@@ jack@@ ets and a emergency car came to the accident at the national road 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ ellers were brought back by a regular bus to the Cr@@ umm@@ ber@@ ner district Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the traveling company .
the investig@@ ators requested the lor@@ ries and possible witnesses to sign in the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste will be from 1st October 2016 for the area of wast@@ e@@ water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ e@@ water fee will then increase once again if appropriate improvements will be necessary .
after the per@@ tin@@ ent lim@@ it@@ ulation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , with the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ o Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that wast@@ e@@ water installations can occur .
due to legal foundations , the Cas@@ endorf Market is obliged to provide cost @-@ proof of the facilities .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg are to reach the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt was presented to the Board of Directors , a re @-@ cal@@ ulation of charges for wast@@ e@@ water plants was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 over@@ l@@ apping and sub @-@ covers from the previous calibration period may be expected .
at all three wast@@ e@@ water increases , Schmidt founded that there are relatively small facilities with a very low water wast@@ e@@ water , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low cum@@ ulative basis , for example , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros were engraved .
furthermore , wast@@ e@@ water wast@@ es slightly declined in all three plants .
furthermore , in the previous year period , during all three plants , not least , due to their age , remedi@@ ation and repair expenses inc@@ urred in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt pointed out that Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical venti@@ l@@ ating plant due to a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the p@@ umping station which had to pass over 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken and during the pond cl@@ adding L@@ opp , the first clari@@ fication range had to be installed , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation capability to be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for this extraordinary expenses , the continuing support and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calibration period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which are still clearly under the present level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that at low wast@@ e@@ water in the three plants , the company &apos;s expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market community of large consumer cost has remained spar@@ ed during the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain on a duration of stone houses , especially to extend the supply area of the wast@@ e@@ water cover of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ al to do these plants , because it concerns de@@ gu@@ itarian institutions .
Bulgaria goes up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .

the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation compared to July 2015 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various materials and services ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in advance in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; effect than Asian car@@ ic@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zes
snap@@ shots says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it enables snap@@ shots to change about 150 million daily exercises that change reality and play with identi@@ ties to such a way that already del@@ im@@ ited the absur@@ d .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lichten@@ stein paintings .
the filters are un@@ covered , self @-@ driven tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ enium per day .
all mal@@ itte arrive to the public .
in the past , snap@@ shots @-@ filters have believed to be found in which they were accused of prop@@ agate the app black@@ face or white skin than beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter , who gave them wr@@ inkl@@ es , false teeth , and dar@@ ker w@@ angen , some critics called a ra@@ cial cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow g@@ out . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y suggests a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and in@@ dig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after snap@@ shots would have thought that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered a exc@@ use : the filter was an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but outer standing , r@@ rac@@ ism experienced , remin@@ is@@ cent of the filter against violations c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused to anim@@ ate the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et were widespread over the photos , that the filter &quot; viol@@ ate and gel@@ in@@ de said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ position of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter has not been sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow face was pulled to the most valuable extreme .
snap@@ shots is not the only company that this cultural heritage was crossed .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment , which we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - which are in things worse than their older opponents - could rather go out , sen@@ sibility to expect .
if one was created by Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters , a picture creates that , for a user , it is much more difficult to stay , as it was earlier the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineering in medium to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , ur@@ ged others to do the same .
in an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure @-@ related contro@@ versi@@ es contra@@ sts a lack of diversity among the inclusion practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and finished their essay using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no variety of representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have done people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe and comfortable to say what to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat , mostly un@@ answered .
the company publishes no figures for diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , they refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokesperson , the company has recently established a staff responsible for population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said i@@ on , that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership IS@@ IS Secret service information , presents Committee of Congress
military deployment of the United States Central Command changed the information in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , as it allows the Ac@@ counts Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Armed Forces , secret services and the military budget , reported notably by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command services , which reported how fore@@ most their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts were changed in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news service information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , present regularly a posi@@ ti@@ ly picture of the American efforts against terrorism than they had known the actual states on site and were consistent as analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article published the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the Cent@@ Com &apos;s guide leads up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed changes in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American forces in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
although there are no direct references to change government officials under Obama , it shows how analysts saw the pressure of their pre@@ judi@@ ces , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ sil .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements , before the Congress , were clearly positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gress@@ man from Kansas , in an opinion .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command changed the after@@ mat@@ h reports to play the danger by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force , after being assigned to them , that analysts were concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are reported by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the Democ@@ rat members of the Newsletter published their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com made an excessive restricted process for the creation of in@@ competent authorities of I@@ sil and the Iraqi Security Services , &quot; the highest European Parliament , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , named Adam B. Ship .
this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of downstream business reports , &quot; proclaimed the mor@@ ality of analysts and &quot; excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence for a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts on a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the congress will be published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General Insp@@ ector , which were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
Ltd . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press @-@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress during the investigation of the General Insp@@ ector &apos;s investig@@ ator .
but he also gave to that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ min@@ ishing opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of this important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , rejected the question , however , President Obama can rely on Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able influences of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the obe@@ is@@ ations about the Islamic state re@@ mind of inter@@ ruption from more than ten years ago , when Cent@@ Com analy@@ st contrary to the recommendations of many analysts at only a small occup@@ ying forces in Iraq and to make a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of Islamic State .
last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker after speci@@ fying government agencies , that contrary to the government &apos;s attack , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these Pro@@ vision@@ al refin@@ eries were used to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander @-@ in , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the elections for its excessive positive assessment of war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 won .
&quot; &quot; &quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , that knows , however : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are nevertheless in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan were un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will inter@@ act on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will take place in the first and second place in their group .
the first place will go a little longer way out of the way that follow the other group .
like the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed at last London games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in his hands ( their two older sisters , playing sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympic Games in 2008 as it could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to contact things for better things .
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the workplace in London that we have now .
we have completely able to plu@@ ck the ru@@ der .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a return cover from the se@@ am .
India had gone out in the game without victory in the game , but the team showed himself surprisingly long and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball in the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good is the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
where ever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro continually will feel constantly and inev@@ itable , a rapid seasons between competition and stri@@ des .
it is when the Olympic Tor@@ ch himself would be a burning bar , protecting from wrist@@ band to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to a newspaper or talk about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los .
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s B with dimples , would definitely be sent to Prime Time that was sent to Prime Time , when it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always swi@@ m the breast and may reign there for a long time .
but if I would like to make a modest arguments for my specific dar@@ ling , let me take attention to the discre@@ te charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had begun in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so many that I had asked , not knowing that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , it never won a medal in tr@@ amp and won a athletes until 2012 , who managed to have it up to the end .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans that share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outside tank , partly because it sounds for the un@@ solved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ or@@ isti@@ ble potential - the cart@@ el trem@@ bling of his never @-@ going mess@@ aging - but also the gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; is derived from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning as a &quot; dive board . &quot;
b@@ lowing winner jumping on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sage ) before they end on the feet .
they will be judged according to official Olympics program according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue along with gold , qu@@ icker , upward and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the target , sometimes and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV transmission also another cave destination : the world or the Olympic Village .
the targeted stre@@ ches is Nobel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atically - and it &apos;s enough to stir up a viewer to t@@ ears .
but it &apos;s also that I feel free of watching this games as a little effort .
the trampoline offers a attraction .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is spr@@ inkl@@ ed up .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or she pr@@ enti@@ t , se@@ em@@ ingly heavy like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down , then down to the top , then effortlessly back to the top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is like Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men &apos;s day on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the en@@ rol@@ ment as part of a delay time of 2 days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that can probably over@@ see the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness is achieved by anxiety and objec@@ ti@@ zing of male athletes , - as recently , the male US @-@ Turner recently proposed - Do@@ ol@@ ey expects its air to be ring@@ ing , new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , a Verb@@ al of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gling to violent resistance by the government .
witnesses testi@@ fied that fifty prot@@ esters were killed during the c@@ lashes with the police in Sch@@ uss@@ ang .
is Ethiopia just doing it ?
over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid mon@@ astic compound with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more areas .
last week , thousands of people rested on roads and requested fundamental political changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen killed and killed in@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the videos present on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men suggest young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now requires an incoming inquiry .
&quot; it was always difficult to meet this country and in the future , Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorist bombing over the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the supp@@ ression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , although dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or forced into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ians .
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to dig@@ nity in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions desc@@ ends along the border with Eritrea ; a fight for this tor@@ ch , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less gu@@ arded in recent years , which could become more or less armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ter@@ ness , after years , is explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , since cheaper smartphones have been increasingly popular and improved internet services .
even if the government igno@@ res access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , above all in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies , where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ian advoc@@ ates that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since then prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from branches of Ethiopia , mainly in Christian countries , while they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat @-@ areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the area of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 percent of the population , and the military , in secret services , trade and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was sentenced to his death for 17 years in the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister for up to his death .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical Genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts predic@@ t that he was especially confident that early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing at this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ on Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ sh@@ ed@@ ent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
different from the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region to North Ethiop@@ ian , Lord H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia lived such a rebellion in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to indications of the government filed , and subsequently stolen from the government .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts pra@@ ising Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in g@@ ond@@ ola , a American city , managed by Tig@@ ray run business , and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly common in social media .
analysts predic@@ ts that protests are the US and other Western allies in an independent position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently became aware of this basis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the West is definitely willing to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to join forces in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gray hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded IS@@ IS , &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign declar@@ es that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republi@@ can , whether it was able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its Mit@@ stre@@ ite , who ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the announcement of a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump did not return on Thursday and existed in interviews to understand that he was really not intended to understand President and Mrs. Clinton in IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just sar@@ cas@@ tic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews , he said the exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to know the Republi@@ can Presidential Candi@@ date .
the last storm of Cri@@ tique is desc@@ ended to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to make the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and have found their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism , as he said , Rus@@ sians should h@@ urt Mrs. Clin@@ ique E@@ mails , but he later said &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his ways to test like certain messages from his fans how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; according to what the reaction is falling . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist , who observed the language of both candidates .
but I think it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements always enough , so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of h@@ itting the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted one of their sound , since its fra@@ gment have declined further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the federal states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he accused his critics frequently , to temp@@ t his testimony or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps jo@@ ze have brought his loy@@ al Mit@@ stre@@ ite into the un@@ comfortable situation to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may be like .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ eption , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; I think what he says legi@@ timate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani asked about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama &apos;s IS@@ IS had an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ side , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he crossed the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Minister for Foreign Minister when it was allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East .
before the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them up at any of his words against him and against him vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot believe it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ umps regarding only one further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once through the price of the market , Café opens in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was an exp@@ atri@@ ate café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay for a Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prizes went out from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set up in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people as last loss in a opposite city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap store . &quot;
but if New York change is , it &apos;s also new finding .
a lively Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than one mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in 2001 at ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to deliver funds for a new external place , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much in .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ ress@@ om@@ atic model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches along with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ations like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
it is natural f@@ iss@@ al .
the café is served no beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a st@@ alled power of old ancest@@ ry .
&quot; many old customers were also forced through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had been moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , they had a wake up the coffee @-@ t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in Ver@@ b , which was pleased with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if they set a bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea added to this day instead of its usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he continued there in front of the work , and presented inev@@ itable .
&quot; I came to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he experim@@ ented experim@@ enting with new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual ordering , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , Eg@@ g and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no gro@@ ove about it , that the soap store has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bore coffee of the caf@@ e as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
the café also accepts the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points .
a new customer soon translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he will soon provide you soon , that his new neighbours must feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local Saf@@ t@@ locally want to fill and sell the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee to the bottles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt , gene@@ alog@@ y , and told that he was on the floor , when the café was closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt , the bed of the loc@@ als and the asp@@ ir@@ ations felt like a return home .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a Fa@@ ch@@ ant for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was something modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes , and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans that should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traded from the Chinese kitchen in the United States , while Z@@ iegel@@ man told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ating the history of American cuisine during Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , s@@ nor@@ theastern I@@ mb@@ iss at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IPO in 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a virgin cheese with olive dishes , whilst Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable oil .
in the re@@ por@@ ters , the couple found a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper , which stre@@ amed the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat , that they serve them as supp@@ er .
minim@@ ized CO@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid up in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male field workers and it was served fresh past@@ el for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans that sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the trails , with which the country moved with , not to be more common . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for Americans was a central , anti @-@ war issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recorded co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
equally ten@@ se , the new bud@@ get@@ away was the new bud@@ get@@ away : mysterious dishes such as bread and cr@@ ot@@ olls were re@@ bran@@ ded as &quot; wonderful species , food resi@@ du@@ es &quot; , noticed Z@@ iegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks in@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , for years , was the central point of the American kitchen , was very rare in the fourth luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally mixed mixtures were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction approach to taste or even healthy food .
during their search for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , domestic appliances - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the hab@@ its hab@@ its of the country .
having published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carr@@ ots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
in particular , reports about the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses in his kitchen , he sp@@ iced as the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world , which he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ red continental cuisine like fish with gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and made a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was delight@@ ful real@@ time alien@@ ation .
President Roosevelt could have committed the same Er@@ ror if not his wife had asked him to equi@@ p him to equi@@ p his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the candidates of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors expressed by Mr@@ s Roosevelt , that the White House made the bo@@ di@@ est food in Washington , but also one of the most fashionable food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , with food was rejected , once the country came back to the legs again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in writing , the pair gave the eating hab@@ its of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law to better understand - for example , how they could not throw food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ ling incident .
after the plate was vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they had prepared a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common tri@@ ck , modest recipes to be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each de@@ af somewhat resist@@ s a spoon in the t@@ ines , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
CO@@ E changed three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ a , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would be helping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed by bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the mighty man of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at a sti@@ cky bomb attack on the Assad regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group that ret@@ ched up to nearly 60,000 people , according to the picture @-@ newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put your own life into the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of civil prot@@ ector , showing him out of a 11 @-@ hour salvation of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to radi@@ ate symbolic figure in the atro@@ cities of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as her@@ oes , he never saw himself , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me is the real J@@ ih@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die this , I think that God looks in me a mart@@ yrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ icop@@ ters have cast four versions bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , a chlor@@ ophyll was filled with chlor@@ ophyll .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bomb that do not play children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cited the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair usually occur only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s hair was only available with 150 years .
it was a consequence of the Greenland station on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he gets on average 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only if it comes up , it accelerates the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal into a full 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a seals .
this lifestyle @-@ shaped lifestyle , however , seems to be a pat@@ rons for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander sc@@ rub@@ bing of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock this life expect@@ ancy , which means for sp@@ ine a world record .
indeed , the evolu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland &apos;s ha@@ em@@ y will be stone .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s hair@@ y is difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea , in front of the thin populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
since it is water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface usually only in winter .
researchers correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair @-@ hair .
their time le@@ aning measures they , when they equi@@ val@@ ed six animals with a transmitter .
sp@@ oil bl@@ asting this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seals , another one had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the ice cream and look for Kad@@ aver , who from higher water blocks according to down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland &apos;s hair , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ metre @-@ measurement .
to determine the age of animals , it analy@@ zes the carbon @-@ 14 method in the len@@ tic@@ ular nu@@ cle@@ us .
this eye lens is already established before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are no longer replaced by the proteins .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as atomic tests for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimeters in length , the len@@ tic@@ ular protein contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , so it is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ hair transplan@@ ts resulted in a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k was an age of 335 years , while the Rekord shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is even 3@@ 92 years old .
if Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females got their offspring if they are longer than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably the threshold for the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ em@@ y is obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
this may also be the world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al cells live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , on the neck of a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ inter , was caught on Alaska .
through the low temperatures , the organism can often live on aspar@@ agus .
so they mature later - and al@@ arms s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm up in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
the volume is growing faster than its surface , by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller beast lives on dangerous and should concentrate on how to have many offspring as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolu@@ tionary bio@@ tic cas@@ u@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one very big animal should always invest in a long life by contrast .
building in a double pack
with topics around the building , the common meeting in the youngest session will be focused on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential premises can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the basic , plot and closing issues are clari@@ fied and the applications were submitted to survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Street @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) on those interested there is no more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the be@@ acon in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au young families and tou@@ ching sen@@ iors are equally appealing .
as it was named , Bau@@ will@@ ingly advised to report immediately in the Town Hall , on the awarding of the parc@@ els is expected to be held in its September meeting .
in order to res@@ ett@@ lement further commercial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council , decided to change the newly created bottle of land in sub @-@ areas in the spring of this year .
thus in the area of under@@ time , the commercial area in the area is expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main took part in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most prof@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncer@@ tain that money houses continue to operate from London financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport the approval in Great Britain is sufficient .
this just advantage big US banks .
several banks have already announced that jobs can be stored .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united on responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone , and further important authorities as well as the European insurance perspective E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) established its headquarters , but it is less significant for the ECB &apos;s financial sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Central Bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg remains a large fund industry , cutting it worse than Dublin in the infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt was considerably easier to reach .
the city also focuses on commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt bi@@ ased a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer management consultancy , the town stands at place seven , Luxembourg on number 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract additional banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researcher .
we also have the power supply : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead preser@@ ves legal costs arising from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. representative decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of legal costs which have emerged from the C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated by a damage deposit of $ 200 million for the infr@@ ing@@ ement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , after a US judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts , un@@ covered .
on Thursday , the complaint was concluded on Thursday , US office of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman that Gilead is entitled to claim the costs which have emerged during the defence of all .
Mer@@ ck attempts to move into Gilead , domin@@ ating the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck had mut@@ tered mut@@ ually agreed and property to laboratory work , of which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredient found in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Swiss taxes
in Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 , this revealed a revenue of USD 10,@@ 75 million and their husband &apos;s income tax rate of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton achieved an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their mandate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ique Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ ene was announced in an opinion .
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hi@@ ding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ e@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish their tax .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not committed by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed for a tax inspection by tax authorities as a reason for its ref@@ us@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented on Twitter &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the release of the presidential did@@ st of Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Cohen , Tr@@ umps Special Advisor to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax insp@@ ections are not completed .
Tr@@ umps Cri@@ tics , among other things the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already published his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations for charity organizations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already revealed a video on the Internet on Friday and released a video on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration .
on Thursday , she also spoke about the subject of a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and his tax explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay for two years or only very little tax , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors , the data could still be the case .
federal states have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren , who would ensure that people earn the more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Hill@@ ary Clinton at the last week of Omaha , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate took his seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ets said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not under@@ go a tax testing by the IRS and have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before v@@ oters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ t campaign has with@@ drawn tax return until 2007 .
Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration of the Clin@@ t of 2015 showed that only USD 100 received their income as a reward , unlike most of Americans .
its main debt system was an cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the US &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were subject to profit .

Jewish director conduc@@ ts Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; collection - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots remains a media response after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , since it had asked Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his final stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed in countries that can be called directly from the hotel rooms .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , allowing Israel to eliminate and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , behind it , stood still more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election was deleted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Handels@@ man called this one &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were hor@@ ri@@ fied and cr@@ ashes from this event .
this is really very com@@ bing .
the fact that in Germany this hotel chain in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet in which the people conver@@ ging a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been given to the alleged collection of arab@@ ic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ aming you &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was referred to another post in which it was referred to that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ vice Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel rapidly proved all the acc@@ us@@ ations of himself and called the incident . &quot; exc@@ ept@@ ed &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ized &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there never had a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel didn &apos;t receive a spokesperson for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds to add that the country code was added now .

at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians , somewhat , from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persian ci@@ vil@@ isation in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner is stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team &apos;s team at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame where British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of the An@@ chor@@ us Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the yacht was proud , and the legend hau@@ gh@@ ed his legend , when he fell into home a win from the favorite New Zealand .
in England four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six olymp@@ ic medals .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after completing his sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London , despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as the execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement brings forth a gap which tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y sieg@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualifying rounds , but in the qualifying rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders took place in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , after his lap , Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy of strategy made a large proportion of transformation , when adding to a higher speed in order to slow to slow it , and to maintain it , and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as the BBC expert , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a floating comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my order and make me a name .
we installed an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 , at the side Kenn@@ eth and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des that he fell to the train after a weak start .
he returned to this declaration later and no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such a superior victory there was no problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the GB flags on the stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event that won a gold medal for the nation , winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if the barometer of our progress in the last five months is , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of knowledge it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently most holy date for British sports ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that &apos;s equal from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something unique to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Then said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the kn@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ er competition on the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ z@@ W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , when the W@@ ig@@ gins stand with safety in focus .
yesterday , he fought with the qualification before the qualification , when the officials requested him to measure his height .
in the course of the women &apos;s competition , the morning continued , and completes , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Arch@@ ib@@ ald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie at the World Record Times in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band to med@@ itate .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were driven down .
in April , Dr@@ ums played in the background , as the resignation of the Technical Director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by sexual and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite soon , as the legendary reputation of GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
the future of the m@@ elt from Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy agreement
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland , Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy @-@ supplier agreement and thus reaching all delivery contracts , such as the lie@@ utenant energy company .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the plant &apos;s operation .
a payout that was set for 20 years expi@@ res in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are located on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endanger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects as the m@@ elt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A completed the Point Henry m@@ elt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the m@@ elt from AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ ging spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium mel@@ ts with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp can hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L comes from that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the m@@ elt &apos;s m@@ elt , &quot; distributed the company .
AG@@ L continues to continue that the &quot; backup transactions &quot; contracts were supposed to be in force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects to contribute to revenue in the 17 financial year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L &apos;s revenue from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dead@@ lines for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L distributed that it had already registered the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ ill Alco@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power the m@@ elt or not ensure the power supply to the m@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 has finished a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been able to come into force in 2010 , even if it is still another statement , why it came from the contract .
in terms of bad economic conditions , the industry war@@ n before the possible closure of the Portland m@@ elt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Portland annually need around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 mega@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ as@@ hi@@ ding Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is based on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kri@@ s is based on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of US V@@ ogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ep@@ Lau@@ der and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news of her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who I love , gave me the view of this Co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just wrote &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , scanned reality video which ends the entire Cardinal Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn , as well as the cover of her sister and end with a classical turn : they have planned all a surprise @-@ art@@ y .
this represents the cl@@ isch@@ e@@ worthy manual nearly every birthday present ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the set , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a animation at 8 am in the morning ) , but Kri@@ s had to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , a new era of car@@ dan began with safety .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim mag able to see what the V@@ ogue covers have been beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league to himself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference , which is similar to a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( l@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , of the 8@@ 32 pages of a scale , 6@@ 15 pages advertis@@ ed advertising ) .
the disclosure of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is so be@@ ad@@ dic@@ tive that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine appeared before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were definitely more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the modelling &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga the glory .
but even in the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - below the previous category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related with famous persons or reality stars or you@@ ths from today who know how to do a good Snap@@ chat @-@ video ( even if everything is hop@@ ing for in@@ separ@@ ators ) .
they are really talented women drawing themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with their reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat curious in fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; Mist@@ y &apos;s Mist@@ akes . &quot;
these feelings come up again , when the message appeared with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut rep@@ ay appears to be mounted at the point .
Kendall J@@ enner is based on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertisement for your prim@@ ers of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her homemade pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her leisure time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres annually 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary agents are rejected every year by common areas of municipal centers , while the industry wor@@ ried to the impact of further short@@ cuts .
in Queens@@ land , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , vulner@@ able workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar rights - at their request for free legal consultancy and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , who are already ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated already are ready for further cuts .
starting from June next year , this legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their financial means .
the Director of the Common Assembly of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Local Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people will be deduc@@ ted every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the government &apos;s decision would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land Common European centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , what means that thousands of people from important services that you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debt , families who have been dismissed by divi@@ ding workers , workers that have un@@ justified problems - all these people have problems legal way and this survey show that they don &apos;t need the help you need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will be forced by 30 percent , which means that thousands of hel@@ pl@@ vulner@@ able people from Queens@@ land will be forced to return with their legal issues without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to destroy these short@@ cuts , so that people will need help you need to receive legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the State Government filled its consent , funds for rec@@ itals on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centers and their customer conditions as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump elect@@ oral campaign being indicted for a supp@@ os@@ edly weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Campaign has been indicted for alleged di@@ vin@@ ation after having been told that her battle leader for North Carolina had prepared a donation to North Carolina in February , while they were travelling in a Jeep in February .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and the CDU lose
on the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses are characterised by the SPD and the CDU .
this resulted in representative surveys of the Outlook research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition could continue to further reg@@ ain in the north , this is not possible after the re@@ frac@@ tures in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would have the strongest party and thus would have good chances of making the government &apos;s government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD also fell by 3@@ 5.6 percent over five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party could only close to the CDU that could come back to 23 percent .
third place is fought between the Left and the AF@@ D .
the left hand rests on 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D were represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens amounts to 6 percent ( previous 8.7 percent ) again in the Schwerin Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at 3 per cent each in the country .
at the Berlin Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey was still only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this makes it still behind the green , with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D was represented by 14 percent for the first time at the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would not miss it in opposition to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ Communic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
today the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thic@@ ker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite t@@ apping .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be rich in high resolution today .
the iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business and it was the first Smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the Internet yet , but they origin@@ ate from the Stone Age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for that time standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even when tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly .
a pocket calculator is available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found .
rather , the price was : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story when not for Nokia .
the cell card of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disin@@ teg@@ ration , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today , suppliers , who came to the market every much later than Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere , this is today for a very many people daily life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion units sold to Samsung and Apple alone account for about 5@@ 55 million units .
the global turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications corporations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the smartphone in the meantime a whole industry has emerged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came just at the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World was introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices into one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , easy to operate with touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ ant success started today , today the iPhone is the main product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola , Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night .
they disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ comprehen@@ si@@ tivity 20 years after its invention .
on average , each German now looks on its phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn all with the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Executive Board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing .
England needs to expand the Olympic spirit and he@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local communities and throughout London , but in all the country renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me this is the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just like that in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be able to reach new opportunities for local @-@ based companies and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already prepare 10.000 new courses , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare a youth unemployment at the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such thinking that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I was said that England never will be ready for the games and we will bl@@ ame us on the world stage .
the two fle@@ ets had wrong 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles for passing , but He@@ ath@@ row answers to each question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn to we@@ ath@@ ing growth and a legacy of abilities and employment both around the airport than also in the whole UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row as the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented tre@@ adm@@ ills in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we can expand this Olympic spirit and he@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display blocks
for companies who earn with online advertising money , according to one of the software vend@@ ors attempts to deal blocking , a &quot; cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it was blo@@ cked on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it could update their filter to block further advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook talked with that his desktop @-@ page would change the encoding on its advertisements , to identify the display of advertising on which part of the page is advertis@@ ed .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Mr. struggle between the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; temp@@ ting Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the envelop@@ ing has been in progress since the invention of display cabinets in the bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it &apos;s possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media in the struggle has ce@@ ased to become a strong Indian indicator for the industry .
according to a study by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , about 200 million people are using bul@@ lets ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who have access to Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ ielding 84 percent of the advertis@@ ers made fac@@ ebooks .
the company has an ad blo@@ cker on desktop PCs except as mobile ad blo@@ cker no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , distributed a speaker .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth reading such as worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad @-@ Pre@@ fer@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ ult new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user , this does not constitute a positive experience , therefore we are planning to make the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared subject of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blo@@ cker are a si@@ est means that we have concentrated on the development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to move more control into the hands of the people .
woman on suspected self @-@ murder on Swiss highway Over@@ ride
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to having a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday in a susp@@ icious self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street , and the police have been hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss @-@ in age of 49 years , accompanied by several vehicles , including a trucks , over@@ ride was wanted to kill myself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , said the police , that as well as any witnesses of the incident .
it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve &apos;s Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be drawn to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not need to go away in the middle of the highway , as it was stated in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ lig@@ ent murder when she had slain a man and killed one night at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious of the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ e@@ woman respon@@ ds to a not@@ orious way -- to a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has more information about the incident at the Thursday near Morges , should notify the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once resident
the Venus was once more hab@@ itable according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that res@@ emble science research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have been un@@ similar conditions .
scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and still persist@@ ed slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet thought of thought out more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against qu@@ icker evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from an sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus will exp@@ on@@ ates its daily side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this heated the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella , to sh@@ ielding the surface of sun heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that res@@ embles evolution , who previously suspected of planetary research .
although they believed to be li@@ vable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of the years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ gen was with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy appeared on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations in the Colorado of Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a minimum participation in the decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years , I have met my duties as a head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion , and determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy had expressed itself in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been thinking over the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a participation right in decisions , affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the late season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches received a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the Wild for a second game @-@ card place in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ e@@ e@@ ö@@ mas@@ king again take talks back , put strike out of
in regard to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea @-@ workers , all disputes for a new round table sit at the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against oil field service Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood@@ Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed with the processing of the current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
in this year , Wood Group has shortened the inst@@ al@@ ments of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company takes the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released and plans for its part @-@ thous@@ es of people , spending his oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , since it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of his meg@@ az@@ us@@ eless connection with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are based on the lower raw oil prices under pressure , an economic situation which had increased by the British decision in June , the European Union , intensi@@ fied .
in the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliamentary report Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the greatest working disputes arising from a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that worked for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea are expected to be at an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Space Teles@@ cope has helped help to collect the most complete catalogue on rot@@ ations of the star of the Ple@@ j@@ ams .
the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars are ro@@ ast in the star cluster , as well as in relation to the rotation @-@ time rooms with the planet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we learn through the compar@@ isons between the mass of an aster@@ isk , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now at the quick@@ est .
at peak rot@@ ations , these tri@@ p@@ pled stars show large amounts of star coming .
because these winds are travelling through the mag@@ net@@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star is al@@ tert , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by acknowled@@ ging the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star ch@@ equ@@ es -- as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rotation @-@ rates shows that a more massive star rot@@ ate more than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars of slow Pi@@ rou@@ ettes turn as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades see that long @-@ lasting rot@@ ors would tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors would like to be ten@@ ding , very bright stars &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said re@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ams offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said re@@ ull .
there is much more to us what we want to learn more about how , when , and why stars can slow their rot@@ ations and so@@ ds their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation @-@ rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ams , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
an um@@ itt@@ able bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs as of
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , the t@@ ears ran faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
after his emotional retreat , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays for the last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under one tenth year contract has been cred@@ ited to him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ tor on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as advisor and coach coach - at full salary .
as a player , it paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
at 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values to the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old could not yet be included in the rest Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field , the appearance outside of the square is controversial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 the super@@ star was issued at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 ster@@ oids have been forbidden .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered prime susp@@ icious , lon@@ gl@@ asting about an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for me for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days don &apos;t run sil@@ ently .
during many bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench often .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first Dop@@ ing@@ encies
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping .
an caught athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
the first official d@@ oping of the Olympic Games were announced in Rio de Janeiro before the seventh race day .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ Meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Ge@@ e@@ ber@@ ber Adrian Target inski were tested positive in Brazil - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tic athle@@ tics competition , these messages come to the accident .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ cul@@ tivating remedy for d@@ oping .
the International Sport@@ fre@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final above 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courts of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the National Federation draws the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the examinations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will co@@ operate with the International Sport@@ fre@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer is the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio le@@ ak the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared the athle@@ tic bul@@ letin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is supposed to act with the banned substance by the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ stuffs .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was provision@@ ally suspended according to B@@ NT , also the B @-@ Trial should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately responded with criticism of the participants of Athens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not drag the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ds from the chron@@ ically @-@ loaded nation must not take part in the Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympics in the class to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they are both dispute , but they are not able to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sports art .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad until one exception due to systematic Dop@@ ings the start@@ ling in Kenya also produces numerous bad news .
in addition , the former tre@@ ats in China had also taken care of fier@@ ce disputes between athletes .
in this way , the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Sun stood at the centre of a con@@ frontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this .
sun was tested positively in 2014 in the Chinese championships positive on the stimulation of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit for a three @-@ month lock .
smart : like per@@ fi@@ de sque@@ e@@ zed h@@ acker their ran@@ s@@ om
programmers of black@@ mail protection are currently targeted to targeted companies - and are successfully successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware fran@@ ch@@ ment specialists in Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with pressed software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware gro@@ unding .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to give the cancellation submitted by the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the do@@ ers speci@@ alize their pres@@ sur@@ ized software according to the observations by Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes , by night , to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential @-@ to @-@ press soldering money falls significantly higher than with individuals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently keep a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most mal@@ war@@ programmes were still designed to send advertising .
then the off@@ ender software discovered for itself .
in the past few months , private user took the goal , but the change to company attacks were dis@@ continued in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is active after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an ox , it is looking forward to easily changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware , and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
afterwards , the software presents the requirements of Er@@ pressed .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must get money - usually in form of Cr@@ yp@@ assing Bit@@ coin .
but where with individuals the personal photo database is on the game , it is based on companies to shut down sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware f@@ ails .
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break even the business activity , in a case , people were in danger .
several hospitals were already affected by attacks in Germany , whose patients can be threatened by loss of sick@@ nesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : pay not , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back again .
for managers , it is difficult to re@@ ject the requirement of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker turn again and try to build good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security for@@ cing areas and contact with press contacts have been investigated and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators try actually to set up a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain their victims per chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , arrange freely accessible support websites or dec@@ ryp@@ ted for example files .
and individuals are redeemed by a few hundred euros , companies must pay hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ Er@@ press@@ ors , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , &quot; explains security experts from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
probably it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their damage software to the form of a software package to the real gro@@ wers .
the previous malware kits were created by buying from malware , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presses are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the newly purchased software under the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we live in a service industry .
thus , in one of the forums in the sub@@ strate , it bu@@ ys the set of a det@@ ective and set another way to install the software on possible many PCs .
payment is made per incre@@ mental calculator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crime toler@@ ates the crime with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies leaders in the Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes survey confidence that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be derived using file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful nar@@ ration , the perpet@@ rators , with the publication of sensitive data , such as customer lists or pricing policy , &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential ever more than before , depending on the type of data .
the perpet@@ rators in the future could be completely new goals in the Internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate safety for@@ scher , how they could get connected with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the un@@ folding of a der@@ art blo@@ cked heating so man@@ chem victims could be worth a ran@@ s@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating in the future a whole production street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday tigh@@ tening
Honda will un@@ pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather re@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers always have a lot of space in the first row and in the fol@@ ond , there is no place in any place .
the materials of the inner space are well processed and comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off there .
a HR @-@ V is versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at the top and 10@@ 26 l in re@@ trac@@ ed back @-@ rests , but there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is less mag@@ ically than it sounds : the seat surface of the back bench can be stretched as chin @-@ beds and provide a storage room that is height from the ground up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he might set his work however slightly qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine setting : a 1,5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top variant &quot; Executive , &quot; no wishes .
the City @-@ Emergency brake is one of the safety systems ( working up to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ ision is ir@@ ri@@ pped , because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ing objects . &quot;
very reliable is the remote assistant .
and the intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts to traffic sign detection and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
all about 29@@ 0,000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are ok .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive 20,000 Euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda provides a versatile and everyday @-@ like car with the HR @-@ V .
Airline code not liable : fall on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger flight on the passenger bridge .
unless a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with haz@@ ards , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the K@@ lä@@ ger had broken down with the down@@ fall .
however , the accident could happen to happen everywhere - there is a general risk of life , such as the judgment .
the airline had to pay no compensation for damages .
case of disease : when pays the organis@@ er
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests proven the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ating case , a family on the second day of her tur@@ quoise l@@ ur@@ bs was heavily affected by di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a def@@ ective killing situation , which supp@@ os@@ edly dirty the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey should have been poor - and compl@@ ain against the organis@@ er .
the claim@@ ers had no success in the court .
indeed , the wast@@ e@@ situation was in fact def@@ ective .
but the organizer was just shortly before departure from the K@@ lä@@ ger .
he had to go forth until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his information duties , so the judgment .
no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps due to infection among themselves - belonging to the general life risk .
there were only 38 members of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violent crimes committed in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had wor@@ ried about other proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and decided to react to terrorist attacks .
surely , our country will not answer the violence of off@@ ences with hat@@ red and split .
we will not love this triumph to terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , but the safety and the strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag .
he also announced another personalized rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely , &quot; in medium @-@ fourth magn@@ itu@@ des over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ie@@ ving for terrorism may be pun@@ ished under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , that tru@@ ce is so amended primarily by purchasing weapons on the Internet .
the most recently discussed silence for doctors should stay in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the medical field , he wants to look for solutions , such as endanger@@ ing the citizens can be decreased , he said with views about mental en@@ doc@@ s .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary .
teachers should have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of gener@@ alised investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior pronounced clearly against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a ear@@ ring for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspaper &apos;s newspapers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ gs from the union after a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and the ab@@ oli@@ tion of the double citizenship earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generic prohibition of full @-@ waste , he is un@@ problem@@ atic for constitutional .
one can &apos;t offer everything that is re@@ jects , and I rest the stret@@ chers of the Bur@@ ka .
you can speak about rules on road traffic or for witnesses .
green chief leader in Simone Peter threw the Minister to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ Part@@ draw@@ ef Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet say@@ ings and a dis@@ appearance of the right to keep people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway exit
it st@@ owed regularly on the surrounding road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that should change : the right turn should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in professional traffic on the surrounding street every evening in the St@@ au , when driving through the Autobahn ( A 43 ) .
on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction is extended in the area between Hammer Street and the Depart@@ ure Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from Hammer Road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early on which the total exp@@ iry of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the bike ride on the fe@@ e@@ way nerv@@ t the car driver mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days goes down to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping path , and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fers on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic on the motorway bridge will be guided over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled in front of the three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason : static calculations have found that the bridge does not have the necessary load @-@ bearing load , in order to take part in the sever@@ ity of heavy traffic .
as long as this comm@@ end@@ ment and the related stress @-@ related stress , the competent authorities can not say .
however , it is possible to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official re@@ usable period of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fl@@ y@@ out , the country has deliber@@ ately searched for the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday a trace along the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of forest school visited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ IMA has also been possible to visit young people with a migration and refugee community , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Young Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural voyage , &quot; 19 pupils from eleven to 15 years were the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee camp for the purpose of visiting schools with welcome groups , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people of the class will be between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , scen@@ ic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will collabor@@ ate together during the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December you@@ thful and mig@@ rant backgrounds between 14 and 20 years are supposed to have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , spectac@@ le and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical voice transmission are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association anticip@@ ates many classes which want to participate .
rain instead of stars : hope of weather better
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stun@@ ned by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night , because of clouds and rain was bad@@ ly suitable for the sky &apos;s spectac@@ le , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is to be good , then we see a lot of stars in the sky .
at the star@@ ch@@ sheds one is about Per@@ il@@ den that belong to the fastest star section with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres per hour .

relaxing night : tips for ins@@ om@@ nia
in the evening , one gets around for et@@ ernity , at night , one is hour before the wake of the wake of the wake of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one @-@ quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent will find their sleep often or permanently .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and it can cause various reasons , emphasi@@ zes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ atory and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you under@@ stands , however , the in@@ som@@ ni@@ es is never , so an embar@@ k@@ ation and inter@@ ruption .
just that &apos;s going to sleep many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Haus@@ Medical Association in Lower Saxony , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht .
what &apos;s behind ins@@ om@@ nia ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors such as medicines are plug .
not rarely is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance of another disease .
&quot; very early aw@@ akening is often frequent in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors work together each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie bad , aw@@ akes every two to three hours , and begins to sal@@ ute over everyday problems and worry , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I do with sleep disorders ?
whoever does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and is not imp@@ aired on the day , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ finished , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has vocal fluctu@@ ations or physical problems such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to distur@@ b the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , co@@ gni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
located in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz , head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , you should feel at sleep problems first at the Haus@@ atri@@ cian , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in sleep laboratory medical devices , such as s@@ nor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , if cancelled or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a break@@ age distur@@ b , Fi@@ xed .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after loos@@ ing the bed , one gets to the bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes of the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping on the ceiling .
how can people affected the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many screw@@ driving screws on which one can use for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is one of the regular sleeping and recording times , not to sleep in bed on the day , not to sleep on the day , not to watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night , it is not possible to calculate immediately , and that is absolutely in@@ conc@@ lusive .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack of med@@ alli@@ sts in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold via Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
he first brought gold at the first world championship in Doha at the same time in December 2014 , at the same time he exhibited his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protecting the ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook in front of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a jung@@ le of 150,000 € should no one go over missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveying system in the swi@@ m sport is po@@ or@@ ly , the d@@ oping controls is very good .
with that , we cannot compete with countries that are much closer and the subject of d@@ oping is not so accurate or even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls shall be set to the controls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , which would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly like that with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not receive a certain time before World Cup / OS from independent insp@@ ectors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A cannot participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the choice of the Hamburg @-@ Hamburger , which now operates an ice@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in total they had over 15,000 Euro in total .
old buildings , a few Left @-@ bro@@ oks , inter@@ connected by another head @-@ bro@@ ker : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
just along the east to the west , one gets on playing grounds , a refreshing nur@@ ser@@ y and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the façade of a gray house somebody has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals are built .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , however , are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , but the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still available rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Henkel had been working for a tough approach to the project against the project , the area known as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms have been clear@@ ed on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were granted official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on @-@ site , un@@ locked parts of the road and held the visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building worker in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the spati@@ ality had been illeg@@ ally , and a day later , police and construction workers under the je@@ wel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants .
in this summer afternoon , the road acts peac@@ efully : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are living here three children , are mostly generated from the police presence .
with residents of the skin projects they divide the concern against rising ten@@ dencies and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z who wish to join the majority of police against v@@ andal@@ proof left .
the dit@@ ch which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police have abandoned between squ@@ abs and their neighbours , obviously not exists .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; neighborhood , which also today has a lower average salary compared to the rest of the city .
there were also numerous houses and the native residential projects already belonged to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been clear@@ ed under a big police battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er had been leg@@ alized , and they were still inhabited by people today , they occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the area has become increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world : the residents of GDR times and former squ@@ at@@ ters share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the rental period since 2009 , which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize them made up of bo@@ iled discs or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades that were subjected to colour@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street this year was mentioned often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbours must watch the problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body bre@@ wing is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of criminal off@@ ences make subject damage , the ten@@ den@@ ial rather to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to cont@@ est@@ able 94 , cannot be given by uncertain@@ ty .
what non@@ violence goes , she is wei@@ ght@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neighbours , whom they were not determined .
also the famous burning cars will give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the archit@@ ec@@ tin , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße and remained .
therefore it was so important that the inhabitants of the residents get their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly challenged the Deut@@ z directive over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to sigh@@ ted new buildings in former building sites , which are push@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are the con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well @-@ divided , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction can I not prof@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if one never h@@ ears ?
there is also fru@@ str@@ ation on all sides , including the police and residents .
for long @-@ drawn , Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who attrac@@ ts , should be conscious - just like someone who can aff@@ ord a K@@ nei@@ pen@@ ile that bad about noise can be done .
all persons presented only with pre @-@ names introduced , not to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisation .
she is also social worker on site .
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been de@@ ferred by the Refu@@ gee for Ur@@ bach since July .
social education in the administration of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger &apos;s team .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , refugees , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else to participate .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the je@@ al@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ king , which has a problem especially .
for example , some - less sp@@ urred as much as much on the multitude of des@@ irable tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a je@@ al@@ ous wool mil@@ dness .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organization , working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been on the basis for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that supports An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le hon@@ ors and main actors .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting charges have been recognized .
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you must submit the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must contribute to the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from land@@ lord and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not any land@@ lord wants to offer its home .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de fac@@ to finds the management no private apartments .
it did not work so far so it was instruc@@ ted to private apartments so de@@ er .
therefore , non @-@ smoking apartments must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , training courts , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be gre@@ ed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home masters , done char@@ itable work - and that mo@@ tiv@@ ate and very ne@@ at , such as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they hopes that the work will lead to a positive outside effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity , however , does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop an ir@@ regul@@ arity .
so , there are no special offers such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are rar .
thus , management and honorary volunteers also jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany wishes and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees , that it takes about it and you can make the time useful for bridges , for example with language courses .
those who want to develop the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , I will not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate .
the significant majority be motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases are also hon@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sh@@ le and customer is therefore also mo@@ tiv@@ ate to mo@@ tiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ eu@@ vers can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they could not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hel@@ per is sensi@@ ti@@ zed but already .
these incid@@ ents are also subject to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have the fear that the terrorist attacks are in re@@ vocation completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary volunteers must look out locally and in the region following activities .
in the background , they always have in the background that a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clearly said to answer the politics .
actually , it is un@@ fair to make it hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there , where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been ex@@ haus@@ tive , even to integrate the previous human beings .
these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need of trouble , we have to help them are both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there &apos;s no simple answers .
