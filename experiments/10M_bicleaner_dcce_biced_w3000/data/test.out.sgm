<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps' economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential election, however, are the tax and energy policy, as well as in a footprint.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warned as the state of economy cannot harm - with taxes and regulators." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to fight the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, he himself would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will reduce regress massively, and he makes a far-reaching tax reform of lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has given disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the salons, Trump and Clinton tell almost worrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are traditional democratic politics and are rejected by the state of the Republican Teachy-Wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, at Trump, there could be yet particiary discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the differences in energy and climate change are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive coal promotion in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion is also possible to be able to date protected areas in date, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton intends to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment program:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the shitve fish trade agreement, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but just to protect only American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">That should also be paid better, just asked about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is an hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs to say, then he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be closer to the control policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side Trump, who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is at least, that's what they want to pay more taxes, and their critics: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When arriving in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria, and among others, dealing with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-fleeing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Consibs took up the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich's help.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home, they have experience with sexual violence, keness, honourable, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">They are pushing them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"tugs for example for a bottle of water is required for a bottle of water, no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that, once they live in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, the standing women would often be considered as minderwerful and still abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 per cent of women who live in the northern direction of the Munich is about 90 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not voluntarily developed."</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question, whether they wished from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers to no.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to proclaim the hands and proclaim the official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counters in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in Reception, I cannot defend this one of the imprint that Ankara is most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Putting Putin's smile, inallized, and he thembled barely warmth, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, repeatedly spoke about his "love friend" Putin - according to a report full of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would like that Erdogan would never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable crummers showed that Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian campaign by the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wuttered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin made it from and accused Ankara to be back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even bigger, since it was committed by a suspicious friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrophos rebuild up again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed, when the Turks would bear guilt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the serious test, the allegations of conducting officials, that Erdogan has benefited their own family of illegal oil retailers in Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He argued this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are clear in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all the friends who he can get in a failed coup d "état of almost his amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions imposed Turkey hard, especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late Imperial onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television approached fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the west since it was considered a weak response to the attempted state of power.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the persistent resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is pivety to withdraw from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian leader won a bonus for the chosen national organs in Ankara following the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-comprehensitivity, which even has a deep-sitting afraid of regimetic.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as once a analyst once described, "Alliance of Foreign Affairs": two countries, which swallowed up from the west and then fail.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently announced the role as peace talks, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be surprising that after almost three hours of the first call at the press conference, they said that they had not striped up the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the President of Turkey missed it intentionally to respond to question about its differences while Putin decided to emphasize this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator could be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, NATO member Turkey is certainly better that the two Heads of State could not speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin made the dismissal Ivanovs ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidiary Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later to be logged and leader of government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state and inspections on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin made the Russian TV station on Friday that IVANOV asked therefore to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious veins.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei IVANOV was a long time in the most close confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, both men were broadcasted on television, both men were able to return on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once became as potential President once, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed to great skepticism once.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, IVANOV says it is true that I could almost say that at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say this very complicated post - they could almost say - complaining it for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it has been out, I have been the Chairman of the Russian Presidiary Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), IVANOV was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met power, he called IVANOV as one of five people who trust in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, IVANOV would have assumed the second term president of Russia, since a third term of Putin was expelled against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before being re-elected for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - what means that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four resolutions in the "Deckblower," the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge stage of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 casings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The economic minister Keith Brown was able to visit the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineers from a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the shipment is between the viaduct and the bridge deck an heikle activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total hadorable cks in their square and last section of the Decks will get a bed for the deck today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first clasp represents a considerable milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of groundbreaking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the past road section and its connection with the north turmdeck you had to close the still existing gap on the north or landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the North Zubringstrabrücke 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very difficult activity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That Teenager and Child will not go out for playing outside, but rather to spend their free time, to spend on screens in the last decade of many complains.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go will therefore be to pick up people from the sofa and be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning, the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on videogames and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of the popculture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users had as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players will go out with their Smartphones for outside and seek Pokémons that were tracked with a GPS as soon as soon as they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the tooth and jumped for the search of sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S. the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person refunded every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Amid, an app for Apple Watch, retracing 35,000 users, distributed Washington Post prior to the launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who will play Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to help people want" "" "bring about 30 minutes" "", "" "" "of the sofa" "", "" "" "and" "" "active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring and boring from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly pushes sports, reduces his chances to climb to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages, which is too long to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people bring about it to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people work on the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mürgous gamblers, which must always be complying about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit previously managed to track our activity, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and leave the use with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success, there will be more games, apps and virtual reality with the activity will be combined in the real world and helping people to be hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">They expected last examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of superior expectations.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabon and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I am in front of the women's Olympic center in the Turning and that's more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspirational for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew, and Madison Kocian, the Cathoolikin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strongly consolidated the black and hispanic presence at the top of this sport-art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female gymnasants a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabon # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabon Douglas was a surprising Olympiad in and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most-made Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but so we do not see gymnasitic classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabon and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics were only four teams in the crew. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turnen is a more expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily associated with parents who are holding their parents' training, travel, travel service, competition and hotel expenses (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these worship, the Turner will receive its full training and that is for families a expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must inspire the municipalities of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabon and Laurie, an affordable and easy access to access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnout foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered a free and affordable car in Harlem for about 15.000 professionals (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winner.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we are expanding to Detroit (my home town) to provide young high-quality gymnast, which earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports art.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness of the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for the health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, the thousands of young girls to be interested, and this is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabon and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic team Congolds and thank you, Fass you motivate so many young girls with different background to start their way, healthy, strong, and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British Reiss underwent his immune system and appreciation of a serious review by taking some of the most dirty and most notorious locations of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel-autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk deposited his course on a Euro-Schein, a banker at the Piccadilly Circus, a purge head of a pulling and public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before demolition of each object, he used a luminometer to show and show us what he is inlet.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, inhibiting the rinsing pot of a pulling toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, can indeed be completely shockingly, but actually, in a kitchen spicy more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left, what he defiled, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been well-known to test the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world, and ate great things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train heads to ramper heads of toilets, the task force his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "he told us," "" "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge waters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was righteous to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His promoter showed a luminometrics of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometres count is fresh-washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet, which he refused to refuse up to 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "This is the worst that I stopped in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll find nothing here, because it's inside the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays Mr Wright with valio gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led the crazy Brainstormings, which thus ended that we spoke "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">It claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of speaking about the products, we wanted to put it into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment that is associated to the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense for humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the movie by the film, added: "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have said some of the things I had instructed to lore him, as the eclipsing Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring it, and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of this dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent reported that they contain at least occasionally products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most vacationers who are on the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so do not choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, placards, balloons inflated, flyers are distributed and rub at the end of the vote, only labeling.</seg>

<seg id="13">Exciting is exciting, like strongly newcoming AFD, and remains at the end of coalitional augurinal.</seg>

<seg id="29">In the surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD still won at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, thirds the leap into the country day.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed of speed, with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to meckties.</seg>

<seg id="8">The opposite will also be responsible for the construction work, about when it comes to the establishment of Behelfseinises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site is on Monday to the south, and the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and therefore the connection to Rottenburg was once again, the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now go back on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">Foreign traffic through the place seems to return.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant discomfort," says the deputy chief executive manager Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachkstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many serenings sought and rather familiar with their Navi as the signposts.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that mancher trucks in residential areas sold in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limitments were not stopped, the municipality intensifies the measured vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="35">When I had been a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt put on an enquiry by Göhner to give it a financial compensation, the hospitality benefitted from the advantages of the position on the B 27. now they are also the disadvantages that contribute to the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other counties, where something generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all cases, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family company has been located here since 1715, and refers to the long history of history.</seg>

<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière tells us to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be in case of speech that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before joining the commentary, in order to skip him under the pseudonym-non-samic men of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the most comprehensive reformation of Schallplatten is not looking forward to a boom in Millennials, who wants to welcome the curiosity of physical objects but to the mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record recently, are all precursor after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no horror by hobbies - it has an emotional significance: older platform buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you vote for Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a news report on television, I would carry me the camera while I live in a sviable road in Soho, before I steal, my hands stop, my hands and some Bestimestly say: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of SoHos is slowly coming to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the building where once independent Seller are located - there is a handful of fantastic landmarks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (data: eight men mean age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and go through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already confessed," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not having followed him home), cloves the walls of his dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when they appeared to buy them young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early' 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably some young to buy it" "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy records, rather introverted and gladly spend some time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I'm drinking very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets with the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old sheets again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations which I have led, people usually have defiled their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their albums sold to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in the record-up of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes some seconds in a business like Phonica to recognise that record stores a soothing community of balance minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older client participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull up the stability of trusted sound effects, by objects whose happy Jugenderings will wake up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think it can be the colt of a empty or the possession of material property as a sort of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social worker!" "" "recorders a staff of one record company." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM revealed in April that nearly 50% of the people who have purchased a record last month, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also found that 41% have a record player who never use it, while 7% of those who have a record, do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report I would probably look very worried while I petals through a stacks of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data: three men middle age), has noticed a "trophy" of the Reviz.</seg>
<seg id="39">"somebody came just recently and said," I own no record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate, so I would like to put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical lases.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who will grow slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost an entire floor, has a blower public as I cleanse.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples for the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and sexcpacker Pop instead of the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagingly psychological traumata are difficult to detectable if you're standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and viewed the Varietrics for the sale of disks.</seg>
<seg id="49">It doesn't make a display mannebummel as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, hence the collecting of sheets does not make real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a repellent Seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, of which is said that a new generation of record-lovers should be inspired by Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to sample the jeans-Hotpants, I observed one group of young teenagers, grouped up for a moment to polite polarizer cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics that contain essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps, because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to capture them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects will mean more money for the industry and to send several clients into the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even the one that is most for luxury objects such as sheets.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my search research showed that the results of Yougov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectiers, which exist in reality, record stores, and online fornications exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday mornings with the beet by record of the Berwick Street and the leaves on sheets, while the starving view of an unhidden, 30-year-old false presenter, who ruled over the shoulders nothing of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, settle down.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial period, the authorities in Calais have argued that the state should be ready to sell 72 provisional stores, in which persons offer or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were rained because they would not be a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid, and that will hide a fire and low risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court whose shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals that are offered by nationally supported association and other groups that would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need of time.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the deportation of people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but dreamed that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais are absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants will play a much bigger role, than just people live, which live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet dues between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rainfant was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camp, the non-profit and 200 meals a day, in English and French courses as well as advice on asylum seekers for hundreds of protection-needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure of these children were a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are. "</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants are estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new ankatres during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain's 7-bit Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at a result of 43-7 in Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, retracing, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic waistband of each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the not too bad consolation prize of the Silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall to her in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji could be defeated in this form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for Britain - but it will probably not be - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>

<seg id="10">Here they lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap is weared, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks against the GBS attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when it was running in running busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau entered the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">In another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly attached the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A beginner hit by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann-Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua found a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the retire and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou previewed by another weak tacking of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learn there.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time through and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova was going through a brilliant mid-play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ran long in favor of the South Ossesulate, whose fans rogging and dances at the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through the fight with the cancer of the coach to the rowing win</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres Gold as with these games and I want to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though, only the conservings were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was one of her second Olympics in succession, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid down such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all their 39,500 is unstable, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athos, who slides over the surface with the elegance of flyers, which does not reflect the species of the triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the herd, a battalion is willing to contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the trainer, which would not survive this day at all, when cancer was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, He risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">A little bit has changed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014, outside the season, starting out what the interruption is to a minimum, if such circumstances is at all the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore it had to go better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and went on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inconsistency of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who tried to speak a nervending morning to process something more than otherwise, to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a centurion in the Royal artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wrack. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means that much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It's repeated how much, how much I and Helen, how much I and Helen, too.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could have no better person for exercising or wish you a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to start, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen cried" "" "unleash in the process, lasting in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to rip itself away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Next week, Glover must appear on a wedding, their own with the TV adventures Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now it just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to comprehend that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "" "" "news service information provided by high-level CentCom Kommandeuren, present regularly a positily picture of the American efforts against terrorism than they had known the actual states on site and were consistent as analyses of other news services," a newspaper article published the report. "" "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom, is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CentCom's guide leads up to the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed changes in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American forces in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct references to change government officials under Obama, it shows how analysts saw the pressure of their prejudices, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements, before the Congress, were clearly positive than the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom has publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls can already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is much clear." said Mike Pompeo, republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command changed the aftermath reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force, after being assigned to them, that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are reported by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democrat members of the Newsletter published their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom made an excessive restricted process for the creation of incompetent authorities of Isil and the Iraqi Security Services," the highest European Parliament, member of the House of Representatives, named Adam B. Ship.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, "Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of downstream business reports, "proclaimed the morality of analysts and" excessive space for different opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence for a intervention of the White House at CentCom Analysts on a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the congress will be published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which were admitted to complaints by CentCom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ltd. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press-precher of the Pentagon, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress during the investigation of the General Inspector's investigator.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also gave to that "experts sometimes have quite diminishing opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of this important topics of national defense."</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0 won.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not belonging to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, that knows, however: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition, and are nevertheless in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan were undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will interact on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two teams will take place in the first and second place in their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will go a little longer way out of the way that follow the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story, four years after they landed at last London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years in his hands (their two older sisters, playing sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>

<seg id="16">"a culture change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We had not the workplace in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely able to pluck the ruder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a return cover from the seam.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone out in the game without victory in the game, but the team showed himself surprisingly long and held the play of 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lute the ball in the gate to get a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Where ever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro continually will feel constantly and inevitable, a rapid seasons between competition and strides.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the Olympic Torch himself would be a burning bar, protecting from wristband to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to a newspaper or talk about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's B with dimples, would definitely be sent to Prime Time that was sent to Prime Time, when it would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even real.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the breast and may reign there for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest arguments for my specific darling, let me take attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had begun in Sydney, it became the last 16 years so many that I had asked, not knowing that it is a Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, it never won a medal in tramp and won a athletes until 2012, who managed to have it up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside tank, partly because it sounds for the unsolved ear for a clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am no expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristible potential - the cartel trembling of his never-going messaging - but also the grazie of the gyms and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning as a "dive board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Blowing winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, real and sage) before they end on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be judged according to official Olympics program according to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue along with gold, quicker, upward and dron, sometimes up to the target, sometimes and back, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV transmission also another cave destination: the world or the Olympic Village.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streches is Nobel, admirable, even fanatically - and it's enough to stir up a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also that I feel free of watching this games as a little effort.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a attraction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is sprinkled up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prentit, seemingly heavy like an astronaut, go down, then down to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, just the dreaming, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is like Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's day on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the enrolment as part of a delay time of 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that can probably oversee the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness is achieved by anxiety and objectizing of male athletes, - as recently, the male US-Turner recently proposed - Dooley expects its air to be ringing, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long, a Verbal of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia, struggling to violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that fifty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in Schussang.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just doing it?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid monastic compound with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people rested on roads and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "the government's response was unmerciful to human rights organizations." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen killed and killed inarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos present on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men suggest young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now requires an incoming inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to meet this country and in the future, Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terrorist bombing over the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, although dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or forced into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to dignity in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions descends along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this torch, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less guarded in recent years, which could become more or less armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness, after years, is exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, since cheaper smartphones have been increasingly popular and improved internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government ignores access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, above all in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet-Proxies, where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian advocates that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since then prospered the Amharas, which come from branches of Ethiopia, mainly in Christian countries, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat-areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the area of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for around 6 percent of the population, and the military, in secret services, trade and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was sentenced to his death for 17 years in the Ethiopian Prime Minister for up to his death.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical Genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was especially confident that early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing at this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemarion Desalegn, was selected from relatively unshedent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Different from the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray Region to North Ethiopian, Lord Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia lived such a rebellion in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to indications of the government filed, and subsequently stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praising Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in gondola, a American city, managed by Tigray run business, and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predicts that protests are the US and other Western allies in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently became aware of this basis." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is definitely willing to support democracy, he doesn't want to join forces in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin gray hike."</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that his campaign declares that his multi-repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republican, whether it was able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>

<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism, as he said, Russians should hurt Mrs. Clinique Emails, but he later said "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually occur only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's hair was only available with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a consequence of the Greenland station on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he gets on average 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it comes up, it accelerates the five-metre-long animal into a full 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a seals.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle-shaped lifestyle, however, seems to be a patrons for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland, 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander scrubbing of the Max Planck Institute for Demgraphic Research in Rostock this life expectancy, which means for spine a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's haemy will be stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hairy is difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the ice-sea, in front of the thin populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since it is water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair-hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time leaning measures they, when they equivaled six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoil blasting this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seals, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the ice cream and look for Kadaver, who from higher water blocks according to downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland's hair, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502-centimetre-measurement.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, it analyzes the carbon-14 method in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="23">This eye lens is already established before the birth of sharks, which are no longer replaced by the proteins.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as atomic tests for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular protein contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, so it is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-hair transplants resulted in a normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark was an age of 335 years, while the Rekord shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">If Greenland-shark females got their offspring if they are longer than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters is probably the threshold for the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland's haemy is obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusal cells live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, on the neck of a 120 year-old harpointer, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, the organism can often live on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alarms slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm up in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is growing faster than its surface, by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller beast lives on dangerous and should concentrate on how to have many offspring as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biotic casulein." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Hoys retirement brings forth a gap which tried Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they remained, when they saw potential in the villi, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy sieged - and Skinner sat in the qualifying rounds, but in the qualifying rounds, the New Zealanders took place in the first round.</seg>

<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought with the qualification before the qualification, when the officials requested him to measure his height.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland, Victoria, as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game as the plant operator will terminate the energy-supplier agreement and thus reaching all delivery contracts, such as the lieutenant energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the plant's operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A payout that was set for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the plant of ALCOA in Portland are located on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closing time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominoeffects as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, ALCOA completed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt from ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the longing speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminium melts with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, distributed that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The complex is owned by a joint venture of ALCOA and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp can hold smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continues to continue that the "backup transactions" contracts were supposed to be in force since November 2016.</seg>

<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL's revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong deadlines for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL distributed that it had already registered the value of contracts in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of a cancellation. "</seg>

<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has finished a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have been able to come into force in 2010, even if it is still another statement, why it came from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">In terms of bad economic conditions, the industry warn before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen, that Portland annually need around 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such thinking that the challenge of the extension of Heathrows is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was said that England never will be ready for the games and we will blame us on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two fleets had wrong 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles for passing, but Heathrow answers to each question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn to weathing growth and a legacy of abilities and employment both around the airport than also in the whole UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which was implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal was built up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequented treadmills in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I'm confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble science research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have been unsimilar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erdlike atmosphere, and still persisted slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet thought of thought out more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against quicker evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from an sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus will exponates its daily side of the sun for nearly two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heated the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella, to shielding the surface of sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles evolution, who previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they believed to be livable, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of the years.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets around for eternity, at night, one is hour before the wake of the wake of the wake of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one-quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent will find their sleep often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of insomnia, and it can cause various reasons, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the German Society for Schlafforatory and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understands, however, the insomnies is never, so an embarkation and interruption.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that's going to sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German HausMedical Association in Lower Saxony, says Jens Wagenknecht.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or behavioral factors such as medicines are plug.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disturbance of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often frequent in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors work together each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie bad, awakes every two to three hours, and begins to salute over everyday problems and worry, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I do with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and is not impaired on the day, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is smitten, tired, unfinished, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has vocal fluctuations or physical problems such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to disturb the sleep disturbance, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioural behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietz, head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, you should feel at sleep problems first at the Hausatrician, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in sleep laboratory medical devices, such as snoring with respiratory sufferers, if cancelled or if you don't find the cause of a breakage disturb, Fixed.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nhibernation," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After loosing the bed, one gets to the bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes of the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws the sleeping on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people affected the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many screwdriving screws on which one can use for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is one of the regular sleeping and recording times, not to sleep in bed on the day, not to sleep on the day, not to watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night, it is not possible to calculate immediately, and that is absolutely inconclusive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few Left-brooks, interconnected by another head-broker: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work on the first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Just along the east to the west, one gets on playing grounds, a refreshing nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the façade of a gray house somebody has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it will be built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals are built.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain, however, are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, but the inhabitants of rental contracts, on the ground floor, are still available rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensenator Henkel had been working for a tough approach to the project against the project, the area known as "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms have been cleared on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were granted official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on-site, unlocked parts of the road and held the visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building worker in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the spatiality had been illegally, and a day later, police and construction workers under the jewel of sympathizers and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon, the road acts peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others entertained vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who are living here three children, are mostly generated from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With residents of the skin projects they divide the concern against rising tendencies and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a Kiez who wish to join the majority of police against vandalproof left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch which the Berlin Innensenator and the police have abandoned between squabs and their neighbours, obviously not exists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "neighborhood, which also today has a lower average salary compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were also numerous houses and the native residential projects already belonged to the Kiez: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a big police battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer had been legalized, and they were still inhabited by people today, they occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the area has become increasingly become the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: the residents of GDR times and former squatters share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rental period since 2009, which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them made up of boiled discs or freshly coated facades that were subjected to colouring.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street this year was mentioned often together with the words" "" "Unautonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours must watch the problem, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body brewing is almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of criminal offences make subject damage, the tendenial rather to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to contestable 94, cannot be given by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What nonviolence goes, she is weightful: people in the 94 are their neighbours, whom they were not determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give it directly in the Rigaer longer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the inhabitants of the residents get their road: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly challenged the Deutz directive over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: due to sighted new buildings in former building sites, which are pushing the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been deferred by the Refugee for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social education in the administration of Achim Grockenberger's team.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else to participate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more thankful that Deuschle is now, the jealous Wollmilking, which has a problem especially.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less spurred as much as much on the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a jealous wool mildness.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been on the basis for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer that supports Annika Deuverle honors and main actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting charges have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must submit the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must contribute to the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from landlord and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not any landlord wants to offer its home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds the management no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It did not work so far so it was instructed to private apartments so deer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-smoking apartments must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internship placements, training places, training courts, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be greed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home masters, done charitable work - and that motivate and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "they hopes that the work will lead to a positive outside effect." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, however, does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an irregularity.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are no special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, management and honorary volunteers also jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany wishes and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees, that it takes about it and you can make the time useful for bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who want to develop the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, I will not work, and be unprofitable, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "problem cases are also honest," "" "people, with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deushle and customer is therefore also motivate to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "" no, "" "" said Regine customer clearly, "" "" what maneuvers can call. "" "" but they could not exclude them. "" "</seg>
<seg id="50">The helper is sensitized but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "they have the fear that the terrorist attacks are in revocation completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do," "" "said Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary volunteers must look out locally and in the region following activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have in the background that a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clearly said to answer the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to make it helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been exhaustive, even to integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need of trouble, we have to help them are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there's no simple answers.</seg>
