Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
we wanted to talk about the implementation of the International Agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
at the meeting , it should also take the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel and casts the lack of commitment during the peace process .
through the deal of the Obama deal around the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of both the two continues .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress held partially as aff@@ air against Obama .
speaking , the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected the vote in Israel with regard to the election .
in a case of emergency , Professor his gir@@ l@@ friend is being shot
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb , with a somewhat angry voice from the police , had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was it important to emphasi@@ ze that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably w@@ right away , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a handwritten note that I wanted , I loved it , I loved Martha and she is the only woman who had ever loved me . &quot; this was , according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who had jour@@ ne@@ yed in two online courses for the Delta state University in Cleveland , Mississippi , and had already visited 300 miles into the school grounds , where he shot and killed , according to the police , according to the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta state University Poli@@ zi@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ality fellow workers have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made a tru@@ sty emergency call some@@ time later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb was , when the police were k@@ issed him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and do@@ ers are forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities ever try to create a picture that &apos;s mo@@ tivating .
the details were published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , including those interested students and collabor@@ ators who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his instruction .
the police , where Pr@@ enti@@ ls died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned himself in a book written by him in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; in which he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching position 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to be problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised himself , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous about whether something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ a Sy@@ kes , told the Lamb that he talked to him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb before had asked the Delta state University to provide a public health for health reasons and I said that he had any health problem .
this year he made only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard for him , no guarantee for an automatic start to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ality @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s questions , the Lamb cannot answer more .
after the escape from the campus , the police took part of Lam@@ bs , as he went to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , self @-@ killing is self @-@ treated with one .@@ 38 calib@@ re pist@@ ol into the back@@ yard of a home about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran into the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began in 2009 his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants , taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs , known him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la hair@@ ston , she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met together through common friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar game for some years .
at that time he was the women &apos;s Black .
all the girls are mol@@ ten , when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ y , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ sm .
the police then said that the dog was right .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ce , Sh@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he had never encounter@@ ed Lamb but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb Ch@@ ann@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail increased both during a summer of three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sing her own music .
he was a nur@@ se , who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sh@@ aff@@ er , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes Entertainment @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a f@@ aint illuminated bar at the night 5 September for the last time saw after it had finished guitar and oral harmon@@ ics completed ahead of a late audience .
there were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we stayed at the edge and shot each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ term seminar program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a German @-@ professor at school .
he was married with three children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta @-@ Campus in Cleveland , including l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the municipality at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Vig@@ il Guard , during the university or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
the Associated Press Card Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected so that the police did so that Lamb didn &apos;t make a emergency , after he had shot up the emergency , and that he had no indication in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two had ever been married .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution , &quot; lasting for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen@@ ed violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .

8 Re@@ frac@@ tory values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is going to take seriously .
some have tried to mark him as a flop .
others cut him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but doesn &apos;t matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull out Donald Tr@@ ump from the top grid on surveys , it has not worked ( still ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the elect@@ oral period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is probably winning the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasi@@ ze that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain , one of which won &apos;t only win a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ ar@@ oos Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps and start to flow their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current re@@ frac@@ t@@ ments that indicate that real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps are popularity rating increased by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University demonstrated that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , 40 percent were .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
for about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has noticed last week , that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of dump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P would be happy with plat@@ ump than candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would be anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusias@@ tically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio , only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can v@@ oters say that they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ys , &quot; if everyone &apos;s Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely heavily cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans belonging to the re@@ public@@ ans ten@@ se represent the real temper@@ ament as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first elect@@ oral state of the nation , the State I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , I think about 44 percent that he do not have the personality to be effective , and almost six of 10 Independent belie@@ fs say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Mail .
republi@@ can v@@ oters face an idea .
when they raise up their hon@@ est , republi@@ can v@@ oters hold plat@@ former for real terms .
if they are being ques@@ tioned , who wins the most successful GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four from ten July secured their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ oters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % of the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nonetheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ v@@ oters are watching a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign as a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered to another candidate , Tr@@ ump recommends almost everybody .
some experts refer to that the split field probably refers to Tr@@ umps lead , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ us@@ us .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ ested more che@@ er@@ ful support .
he made 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and eventually ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would take over 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a succ@@ essive majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of v@@ oters will support the plat@@ former that they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , it can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never modify the opinion .
46 percent said that they let the door open to change other candidate .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is most powerful competition at the moment of the other external uni@@ on@@ ites , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but v@@ oters who have formed their opinion , are twice as often for black@@ out .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they co@@ in@@ cide with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump developed in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; was the Im@@ migration and Angel@@ s of the public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expressions of gr@@ ot@@ al vital Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will be far away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new ori@@ enti@@ ent efforts .
but according to the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans agree with Tr@@ ump to match the immigration issues .
as long as the immigration will remain in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will certainly do .
fru@@ str@@ ation about the government leads to new maximum distances .
by now , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there is nearly half of Republi@@ can v@@ oters , notably by their external se@@ ash@@ ite status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day @-@ survey by ABC / Post@@ al , they rather want a political under@@ dog as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa 2 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ o@@ ily den@@ o@@ unced . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ foot@@ path there is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
the road costs a square meter of a cage car on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited to objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the study , therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows that special clim@@ ates will cost one square meter square on most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich aren &apos;t really little .
but unlike Germany &apos;s top resi@@ du@@ es , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service provider Angel@@ s &amp; Völ@@ kers released a leaderboard of the most exclusive German resi@@ den@@ ces - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands per square meters - per square meter , well noticed .

by the way : Munich , there is no closer look at the front .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich counted word . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2011 there were also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
yet the Bav@@ arians , who had inv@@ inci@@ ded seven European @-@ ups du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they were cour@@ ageous , however , with their vig@@ orous adv@@ ances , often too un@@ imagin@@ able works .
the attacks were often led by playing re@@ location to Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who , against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i , rarely passed .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ k that struck the left half of the left in the left corner of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os of Stür@@ mer M@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper created Roberto with the kne@@ es ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians are familiar with their usual game , Pi@@ raeus was able to put the dot .
however , on Tor@@ be@@ ter Manuel Neuer has been off@@ ended .

who is rough , has higher risk to lose teeth
those who smoke , is not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that &apos;s a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of reference , the risk decre@@ ases fast .
smo@@ kers have increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers the risk of losing their teeth was pre@@ mat@@ urely to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
key causes for loss of tooth , car@@ ies and inflammation of the g@@ um , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ al disease , smoking is a risk factor , emphasi@@ ze the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth should therefore return to frequent g@@ um disease at smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied , however , smoking is increasing the risk of car@@ ies .
people who list@@ ened to smoking , however , could decrease the risk within a short period of time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until endanger@@ ing the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich was born from the English University of Birmingham .
one should be convincing , non @-@ smo@@ kers , study leaders H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoke is good for l@@ ungs and containers and leads to a good denti@@ stry even to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by dental am@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking causes the risk of early loss height .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .

European Commission proposes a new court in contro@@ vers@@ y over TTIP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system by the planned Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP .
therefore , the controversial private circuits for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system employ@@ ing the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the commission@@ er for Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the swe@@ at present , the proposal for a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade conversations with the USA .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is said to create 800 million people in the world &apos;s largest free trade zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly see that the EU Member States and the US will jointly select independent judge for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third @-@ countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to lev@@ ain against jud@@ gements .
so far , the trial involved between arbit@@ rators and arbit@@ rators , by far , did not apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it was clear that citizens won &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice , commented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she wants to work on an international investment court in the long term .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ ns debut in Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gments by Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut with tension expected since its election by the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary elections
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn , the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn , will set up his debut as Prime Minister David Cameron and put together with David Cameron &apos;s first time .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn is to raise up for the first of his six specified questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour dep@@ u@@ ties .
he called &quot; fewer plays and more facts &quot; with this weekly event .
he also said that he can ski@@ p several sessions to ski@@ p their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let and his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing National An@@ them , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked a look at a number of dec@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and stands in the focus of several title pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour President to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith , that the mon@@ archy was abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of sh@@ adows ministers have refused to serve to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ st@@ el of the Parliamentary Democrats originally supported him as a guide .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also pil@@ oted within Labour , &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit among profits .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn told the TU@@ C @-@ Conference to make Labour Change in order to remove the whole idea of a limit total .
hours later Mr Smith said , the Sh@@ adows @-@ labour and pensions ministers decided that the party &quot; very clear , &quot; that it is only against government plans , to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ .000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn , will be the fifth Labour President , David Cameron , since then he &apos;s T@@ ory Chef , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the Labour President , promised an other policy approach , says that &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron has given more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front , and that he under@@ lined both &quot; impact resistance &quot; and its stretch with re@@ lin@@ ens being made instead of serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn told that Angela Eagle today will represent a host of host government , if he is not participating , for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk the idea that other colleagues can act the word , and that he had addressed John Ber@@ ks , the speaker of the company , to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was tied to politics in the style of a &quot; bi@@ quit@@ ous theater , &quot; which often joined the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he dre@@ amed that he failed .
since they were first broadcast in TV in 1990 , the survey was considered as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his guidance in the Unter@@ haus and his position among his legislative bodies , although critics have argu@@ ed , they became a car@@ ic@@ ature and would have far @-@ reaching reforms .

the pound sur@@ passed according to data , which increases the rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the prayer target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result was expanded without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and achieved in@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments since 2009 at the time of interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the ri@@ vals received by the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were recorded after encouraging messages from the competition &apos;s competition for lux@@ uries Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ set latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry , growth continues to growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose 5 % after the Berg@@ bau@@ ri@@ ese said that he has taken 2.5 billion $ by a share ticket as a part of his strategy of debt reduction .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing force in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is un@@ likely that these purchase amount will become equal to higher labour costs in his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could make exp@@ ander plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster brings Lib@@ an@@ els on a potato @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and in the potato woo@@ fers , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the &quot; potato &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat has put together a container .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen accid@@ entally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a gr@@ pan@@ ic sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; writes Al@@ h@@ ay .
the original idea has now moved to the Lebanese man at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much flesh and how much potatoes naturally contains the sk@@ e@@ dies , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y .
only so much , &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
the culinary desires can also be concerned with its customers .
Met@@ cash k@@ icks off excav@@ ation campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - dec@@ ay
cash cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di hill in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in an advance to a $ 700 million al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ ler Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ borough , who distri@@ butes products and shop@@ pers that sell tickets to the South Australian soccer league to loy@@ al customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash further details of his defence strategy will be released on 29 September when the wholes@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and equipment is through its annual investors strategy day .
it is much on the game that South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ stores and generate higher profit margin than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern States .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ti@@ ally controll@@ able and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening of its first markets , five percent of the food market in these two states will take away , but mainly auto @-@ independent sales will take away .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley reported that IG@@ A @-@ retailers can lose 360 million US revenue per year and cash cash 250 million US $ to the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
however , the loss in food and grocery stores and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s @-@ high fixed cost could cost - cost savings of $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , isolated market shares in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loy@@ al .
Morgan Stanley participates in the food and market segment by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and by 2.1 percent in 2015 , to 10.3 percent in 2015 , to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , participated in a business meeting in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member receives contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food trade , which have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting improvement of operative debt reduction in con@@ flu@@ ent sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ al@@ ers will rep@@ ose and invests more than 150 million dollars in order to make sales prices of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ship@@ pers for hundreds of products every week at improving their stores due to improved fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label food .
met@@ a &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that prices are going to lie to El@@ an , hop@@ ing that the wholesaler distributor will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ves towards the view of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special KS , &quot; became the not@@ orious revolution of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cincinnati as soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is and his opponent , Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator , Har@@ rison would have had to strike that Kyr@@ gy@@ ah , and I should beat the child . &quot;
during his last appearance , as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp was cr@@ ushed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Coc@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing , through which I felt very angry , is the fact that after my view , Tan@@ asi was a little over the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broken a ra@@ cket fire , when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken the ra@@ cket of fru@@ str@@ ations , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s in the US Open extremely well beh@@ aved , even among the pretty curious circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around themselves , he has a great family around themselves , and I think that he was a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it , after his own contracts .
He@@ aly supported the decision to take into account that Kyr@@ gios are unable to take into account the important decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to his team as a long @-@ term firm . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is complete on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has made very fast the rise of people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public , but we are trying to re@@ prove him , but we are trying to think him to think him , and it &apos;s best to the team , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emer@@ gen@@ cies , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the slaugh@@ ter and drove the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that they tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , as hundreds of migrants responded to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with in@@ dig@@ nation .
the people who had fled before violence , had prepared for an unknown time in a land@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing on the road between the two control points of the states and erected there , settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose to .
when a police helicopter against them , the immigrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried out the si@@ ties against Hungarian forced police .
some came back from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned from Macedonia for more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to sett@@ le the responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the over@@ flow@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope , last@@ ly - the next month or until the end of the year - a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit on the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary also won his hopes for a bal@@ ancing action of Brussels and of his neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two Southern regions provided more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate blocks and asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said the fact that his country also has the construction of a por@@ cup@@ ine wire along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata also reported that even j@@ ok@@ ings in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable amount of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and to an input point in the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has passed away , however , that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war@@ fare , claim@@ ing protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force around midnight in Hungary will make the crossing of the border , or damage the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , which leads the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws apply to higher pen@@ alties for human traffic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation which emerged through mass migration , the Hungarian government states the emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament still has to agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associated Press were already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that officials had 45 people attempt to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come about by attack@@ ing the fence , they are now for@@ c@@ efully , and are accused of adher@@ ing of pen@@ alties according to the new laws .
the public authorities can quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian authorities also included two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a pulling car with bar@@ bed wire in order to close the boundaries .
chaos had surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in an metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd of people around it .
about 20 managed to pass , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants blo@@ cked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would have denied food and water until they come to Hungary .

more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic v@@ oters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters have more competent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some demo@@ graphic groups during a number of demo@@ graphic groups .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and vegetables , but these pre @-@ jumps have decreased .
their support for men has pl@@ under@@ gone considerably , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic v@@ oters below 50 years has volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big lead with the older v@@ oters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit lead in the liberal , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic v@@ oters in the country elections say that they would support with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some examples and 15 percent would support them only because it &apos;s the duct for duct .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps no surprise that Clinton &apos;s current supporters have especially fascin@@ ated by her .
the views are more powerful with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about one @-@ quarter would help them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 per cent of the elections of the elections say that they can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer Republi@@ can v@@ oters turn over their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter is being asked in an open question , why they are the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time is that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best Canadian ge@@ coach for the job ( 10 % ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
the agreement to dealing with problems and v@@ oters will also be quoted .
since the Vice President puts a potential for the presidential election , 57 per cent of democratic v@@ oters in the elections take him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
when Democratic elect@@ oral elections were asked , who would be the second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top of the elections .
from Clinton &apos;s trailers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
does not decide to can@@ st not for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head increased slightly ahead of S@@ anders , out of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
thirty @-@ five percent of democratic v@@ oters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den has a second at this measurement , but the percentage of seeing him as the &quot; select &quot; has increased .
nonetheless , in the question afterwards , what is more important to a candidates , are called Democratic Party questions on v@@ oters .
similarly as in the last month no single Democ@@ rat candidate or potential candidate for this v@@ oters turn out as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates obtain good results with some important characteristics of v@@ oters in the election of their party .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den finds the lead in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic v@@ oters think not that Clinton tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy - twice as many say that regarding S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion from him .
Democratic elect@@ oral elections in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements about one @-@ quarters of democratic v@@ oters has no opinion from S@@ anders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and an server during the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; are the majority elections being happy with their explanation of the matter , saying that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was come to light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general consent of Clinton , although 36 percent reported that their opinion has deterior@@ ated by her .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy to become tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered votes : only 32 percent they see as tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than May .
62 percent of the v@@ oters are not valid for hon@@ orable and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights known as not tru@@ thful and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes with lead .
among the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush have the best hon@@ esty .
there is a vast majority more than hon@@ est , but like Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic v@@ oters in the preliminary elections were 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns along a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times po@@ em behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on both candidates , half of the v@@ oters fall into the new survey , and others lose dramatic last stop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can v@@ oters will support nationwide tr@@ ump in great numbers . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , at 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ known for demo@@ graphic groups and has master@@ ing Republi@@ can v@@ oters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ es , is beaten by the Wiscon@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell in the deep@@ est month , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are available with 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons from Republi@@ can v@@ oters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son wants to rise in the surveys , during 19 % of support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post revealed pl@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view over one of the last week , Car@@ son invented a couple of side @-@ ie@@ ves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son himself ap@@ olog@@ ized to ask Tr@@ umps in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign presence in I@@ owa .
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient to present hot water .
a private bath in the North and Baltic Sea is likely to be a fun at a maximum of 17 degrees .
man@@ cher is not going on the sea : maximum 18 degrees spread the water in the North and Baltic sea this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
the pool temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood &quot; Death with the Death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , being appe@@ aled against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch in September 2013 and delayed its transport into the hospital which contributed to his death , the police distributed .
officials said that he had been charged with a 30 pound Back@@ pack full of sand and had been attacked , while he tried to attack across a Fro@@ zen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he consci@@ ously fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned , and waiting for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to replace D@@ eng@@ s appar@@ el , replace their symptoms , such as goo@@ ders and Andy Men@@ g , the national pre@@ sidents of the Brotherhood to contact Council , &quot; said poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members began to hide and ordered the bro@@ therhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died of his injuries next morning .
according to a Autop@@ lay report , Den@@ g repeatedly were coupled with a bl@@ unt force of injuries on head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the un@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies to the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ therh@@ oods and their members must be drawn to account and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe received a criminal charges because of murder on the third five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with ik@@ i@@ an@@ ous attacks and formation of criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to take the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood c@@ res@@ isti@@ bly re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interest is coming , and the bri@@ cks are sh@@ aken in sh@@ aking , returns that bonds will rise , and the economy will be sli@@ pping into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what we know .
what we don &apos;t know , how long will it take you and how long will it be stopped .
in particular , the history of the economy does not offer low instructions for the course .
a recession came within just 11 months after the initial interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the ag@@ gression of the Federal Reserve with raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in such as economy and financial assets react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates when it begins to increase interest rates , rather rather to the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
by the end , market participants could determine that the whole set could be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheaper price &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal altitude , but still on a low level to show the seism@@ ic shock , which seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no imp@@ lications .
here is an overview of historical trends based on how some areas of economy should react :
as the market has seen last month , interest rate of interest ten@@ ds can make things more volati@@ le .
once the increase is met , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a ten@@ dency that wealth funds are decreased from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank @-@ Anal@@ ysts in a recent study , what inspired by interest after interest .
more precisely , the market has been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to the room rate ro@@ sion , rather flat in the last six months , with an average return in recent six cycles of 14.4 percent , according to current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , head of plant Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks of shares will later occur in the increases cycle , and return on return to decrease .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic experience , but interest vis@@ it@@ ures often promote them often .
in the current case , F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions , which could not exist before and that a recession may accelerate .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , that was only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few that this persist@@ s is expected to continue , forecast for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee held this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading only accepts a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to today was held in a super cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ation in GDP , and in front @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists were taken very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly lon@@ ely recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far the longest , which has wa@@ ited for the last recession since the end of the last recession . the record was 35 months , and this is up to 74 months .
solid income was also volati@@ le since the market was im@@ min@@ ted , as the market is quite similar , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the key difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / reduction in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the increase cycle , an@@ cho@@ king par@@ ked once again , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer relations between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to the curve of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring in such a climate more income although &quot; we are careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ sti@@ n at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , Jones , means that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy &apos;s expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ row@@ ings have increased , and volati@@ lity under@@ gone - all market characteristics when F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the big and entire company , companies that need to un@@ cover the bigger part of their business activity in the United States , including interest rates , and local products will become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be worse , since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive and the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are very positive , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Anal@@ ysts in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance after each of the interest ten@@ sions in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ratios as well as low volati@@ lity with their shares were also out@@ dated on average by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts will be a big problem .
with a high proportion of flexible interest , we will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the purely stock of shares , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
money could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are from different opinion , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of the Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ feder@@ ate Member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the transmitter due to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , saying that they only im@@ itate The Br@@ its
board @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins , who helped the Voice to The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading European Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not doing something that does not do the broad@@ caster .
econom@@ ist Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and increasingly cannot be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; Radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seems to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , where you &apos;re actually im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
the BBC @-@ General Manager denied the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is close to its commercial competition , when it comes to live music and re@@ conn@@ aissance .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music fans , which is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music to be found and new works on behalf will I really have for important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ably worked for har@@ der to engage in the audience as it did in the past , since the British informed less than classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture , Media and Sport where it became a fire which became the commercial ri@@ val to the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice to the BBC , the musical talent show of the BBC , who was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall left the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; produced on a special BBC @-@ Way &quot;
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our house @-@ own stable &quot; when it star@@ ved the next time a consumer series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the ordering of other rows of The Voice in the Future , or give money of the making of fees to other maintenance formats .
Internet sales grew in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased 3 years ago through the use of mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday broke out in November .
for over a decade the virtual shopping is dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets changed into spirit cities .
however , experts say that there are signs of signs that the online sales will be stagn@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are early signs that online sales will make up only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you consider the growth rates for the previous years and continue until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale charts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it declared that the online sales were reinforced from three years ago as a buyer , with their phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and do that people could do this in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uted , and we may experience that the growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for excessive revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take its purchases at this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers were log@@ ged in to their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed .
experts believe that Black Friday to compl@@ ain the buyer for bar@@ gain , buyers might depart from it , purchases .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has found that from £ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases must now be done via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of human clothing and shoes online rather than in fashion chains in the interior cities .

Mr Ak@@ ram was born with his parents in front of the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great mosque .
Saudi @-@ officials have already expressed that the H@@ add@@ sch to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands , which continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden Group could not have the arm of the crane not yet used when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency was not saying this detail , however , that the Company &apos;s leadership is forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man commissioned Sal@@ man , causing the fall of the gar@@ land , crashed into a courtyard of the large mo@@ th@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were shot at the H@@ add@@ sch , which were then assembled in this month .
the Bin Laden Group published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .

the number of skilled ar@@ tis@@ ans from Eastern Europe has an increase behind
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix @-@ shops , which can be opened on tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ F@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q Le@@ aders nationwide
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef Pro@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its will perform their hamm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified European craftsmen that perform works in their home ,
if you sk@@ ill@@ fully sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a pain@@ t@@ brush to handle walls , you are just part of a minority .
since Britain employs increasingly des@@ people to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique L@@ ry , a new CEO of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a major increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices .
therefore , King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open a 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shop , close to ar@@ tis@@ ans and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate among the men .
she said that it is necessary to make the growing demo@@ graphic trends to make more female single households , which perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must post@@ p@@ one this stronger to a balance .
generally , half of our clients choose 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , their top team rep@@ lic@@ ated to reflect the same number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
it is the only company that King@@ F@@ isher was the only company owned by 50 percent of the team , including his Management Board and Chief Financial Officer .

it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the drop@@ ping of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence decided that the association did not have occurred at any time , as asset manager .
however , the sports officials only charged growth damage and the sports club , which they had been operating from 1982 until 2011 , and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money , from the liabilities reached in 2001 - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go on or un@@ locked the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the accused were chief financial account@@ ants of the financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take on account of this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money to put our life insurance policies as security in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been agreed with the club : you can administ@@ er the money , but no deb@@ ts must be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , upon appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the termination costs had been determined retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , one part of the allowance is only years later , namely , from 2003 , when an increase was charged on the account , paid out .
therefore , the l@@ ump sum and non @-@ deduc@@ tions explained , the former Ob@@ mann also explained the processes .
accounts for the two def@@ endants , the two accused , said the accused .
why don &apos;t the c@@ ash@@ outs need to be paid out in detail , the judge asked .
not in detail , the association is not interested in the financial support , so important to the school freedom , so the answer .
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the association account for the preliminary investigation of the country .
that were the accused , those accused were def@@ endants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to their testimony .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the judge .
then the respon@@ d@@ ently asked for a long time .
then he thought that he had believed that this is the best for the club .
if something would happen , nobody would have w@@ asted anything from this money , the prosec@@ utor dropped in the room .
the def@@ endant was to be informed , jus@@ ti@@ fying the func@@ tionary .
the transfer was formulated as &quot; damage award . &quot;
why waste ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
then the first def@@ endant , he had not agreed with this wording , since the association was never created a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ye are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
by far the functional , he never have a cent content of related , he calcul@@ ates only o@@ dom@@ ination and di@@ ets .
in Di@@ ets , he had bil@@ led the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort was much higher , he added .
for the early years , the accused were not able to present def@@ endants .
these are after an operational test , where everything was evaluated as a correct , not more kept , explained .
o@@ dom@@ ination also had the second def@@ endant .
all of his dwellings is in cash , in this way he had to drive from his place of international bank to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces a further 30,000 jobs
in addition to under@@ mining operations , computer cutting will inc@@ ur further jobs during the development of the company for three years .
the job vac@@ ations of the Swiss computer label Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) is no end .
in the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the breakdown of 25.000 to 30.000 positions in its corporate client@@ ele .
this means that costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company distributed on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around € 2.7 billion , which will inc@@ ur in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ .000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
in the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had still around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard share provided 2.3 percent of the exchange rate .
the large @-@ wor@@ ded group from California Palo Alto is now ob@@ sol@@ ete : thus , the computer and print business will be bund@@ led up in a new company - separately from reporting institutions , computer servers and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a dis@@ appo@@ inting PC shipments , as well as a we@@ aker demand for corporate customers after its services was the second largest PC manufacturer to the phone in the world .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 per cent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
so the proceeds of the revenues went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive job vac@@ ations on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man respon@@ ds only late to react to smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and allow more business to perform online .
Whit@@ man Restru@@ c@@ turing plans will see a total reduction of approximately 55@@ .000 vac@@ an@@ cies before .

24 per cent are in contrast to interven@@ e in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , re@@ ject 51 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents , 20 percent would be .

40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , poles and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially gave out chili spray .
afterwards , the police used Tr@@ än@@ st@@ as .
much lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as has been spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
these refugees have now with@@ drawn away slightly .
a pregnant and apparently last woman was worn out of the zone .
children , who had met the lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as , cried out .
other refugees c@@ ashed around themselves together and suffered under respiratory suffer@@ ers .

time of decision on interest rates for the US sheet database
the world is ob@@ serves if the US @-@ Central Bank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , conducted by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do something longer , now that the F@@ ed will keep a bit longer , and interest rates on this current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it &apos;s seven years ago , since F@@ ed Interest was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we appro@@ ached a situation in which a large central bank may aband@@ on the zero @-@ area and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars to balance and generate only a low inflation rate .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less ro@@ ub@@ ly outlook on global standards .
she war@@ ned the markets , pointed to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are well against such a step .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
sign of death at Delta State University leaving compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues day on Monday morning - and before he wrote his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb is a note to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it un@@ restricted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ ous , Mississippi , said that Lamb , L@@ ecturer in Geography and Social Sciences to the Delta State University , called for emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said , I shot upon someone , and killed someone .
Lamb also said the staff of the emergency call that polic@@ emen will send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I supp@@ oss my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody is anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quire after his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
Lamb was no explanation for its shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who had ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 Miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a Professor for History , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police officers arrested him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ality @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt said the authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ce was told by Sh@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en that she had married for seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ce would have had a daughter who is 19 ; and they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that , putting his daughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Absol@@ ute best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Kn@@ ow@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Kn@@ ow@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who poss@@ essed a dog called Light@@ ning , had risen since about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kn@@ ow@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police then , Lamb was set at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers came on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on Highway 1 , Lamb car@@ ved on his car on the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , a PhD in his life on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa increases the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of Group construction .
in the same year , Lufthansa Group wants to save a half @-@ billion euros in the same year alone .
Group 150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 managers will cost Group sales in the workplace .
with the pilot qualities there is in the new negoti@@ ation .
the Lufthansa develops its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the stock@@ bre@@ wing Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the return of real@@ ign@@ ment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year for cost and redemption , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things there is no board member for the passenger business in the Lufthansa .
the low cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings sol@@ ves as a stand @-@ alone as possible .
the board team led by CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the re@@ location , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , to which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airline &apos;s flights will be under the airline &apos;s roof , which provides three quarters of its annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negoti@@ ation with the pilots
in the tariff negotiations with the pilot issue of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are supposed to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
they shared the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inside a year with a previously predicted rec@@ lining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can come quickly to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competitive results &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sh@@ aw from Manchester United can &apos;t play months off because of double frac@@ t@@ als
at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , Luke Sh@@ aw was a double t@@ inc@@ ture of his right b@@ last .
while keeping the left external def@@ enders to we@@ eping and finish it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal is not hop@@ ing that Sh@@ aw can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sh@@ aw broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes before it took the necessary oxygen before joining the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg end and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he will be transferred to tomorrow , or perhaps operations in Manchester .
it &apos;s awesome - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing cabin he had a oxygen mas@@ ks .
he wept .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double t@@ inc@@ ture , then takes the six months and he won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of a meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , does not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal was suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had s@@ cour@@ ged .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe , how broken I am , my way to recovery will start now , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot;
here : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sh@@ aw when the PS@@ V defeat .
with the European Championship in France , the UK defender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until the next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to infr@@ inging his opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was going on in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like that I know how heavy to be something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron doesn &apos;t know the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing to study all parents : if your child love a book it will not take long until you know almost completely .
unless you have David Cameron , you might have David Cameron .
as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , decided in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a news on the site of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with powerful message , it &apos;s always a book that I like to give to my children , since it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
everything beautifully and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead of ren@@ dition the new characters of the movie , added to the new characters and details in order to en@@ force the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all of the nature came and even the air is a merch@@ andise , be@@ fore@@ hand a boy called Ted , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ ages , and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if this is not yet powerful enough : the text of Cameron comes partly yet : &quot; in the re@@ w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a merch@@ andise , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey who win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he gives me to be a pra@@ gm@@ atic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is a little familiar , like the local environment through the G@@ rub@@ bing , trees over@@ l@@ apping , t@@ need stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to one assistant , while the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker spoke , that the text had probably came by Cam@@ er@@ o &apos;s voting office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there were no direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely endanger@@ ed from the German team &apos;s exclusion , but it is still difficult .
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task is a difficult task , but when you chose the K@@ ader , England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a further victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Site is less experienced than that of three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the common spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful and positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bowling and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related information : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own top @-@ cho@@ ices .
a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
if he hopefully hits further barrels for Yorkshire , a further chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he didn &apos;t give good performances , and that is not surprised me , he is primarily a team man .
the question of how much time a Test @-@ perc@@ ussions gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th was awarded seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only throw that one can raise is that England first sat down in the Caribbean - but when Ly@@ th was in high @-@ form , but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a perc@@ ussions , whom I shoot up high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yorkshire very early in this season when he scored 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must obtain at least the same chances as they received before him , but this course depends on the team performance in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , bring an extra Spin bow@@ ls and receive four qu@@ icks , de@@ af , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ussions can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ handed ring has shown that he &apos;s an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket @-@ Player .
Mo@@ een maybe did not get his job for his County of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first time before he joined the open@@ er in 2001 .
he has done three hundred p@@ ence immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the c@@ ader than back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me more than young men .
people may visit his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise up their hands and the train@@ ers have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart supplements when exercising .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ie , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a championship coup for the test games .
he is one of the most hon@@ est Ker@@ le of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is used for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not work on the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , they depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken part of the heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ line greater Britain from the EU ) could gain access to ad@@ mitt@@ edly when the economy would run into a f@@ row@@ te equipment by 2017 .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at prosec@@ utor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said several member states , deeply sho@@ cked in several cris@@ es , such as the EU is now and not always of its own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with mir@@ ro@@ red conc@@ es@@ sions and dist@@ ressing conclusion that they are not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided to see its annual meeting that it also doesn &apos;t like to end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb@@ s to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign basic cities , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come to home and say that they ally win for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to be@@ fore@@ seen great Britain within the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and reveals that more and more short @-@ term ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going on .
in Germany , German c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks poor for it , as it happened during the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a forbidden force .
Poland may soon be a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to aid one leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better for it , Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to include the most similar separ@@ ati@@ st trends .
therefore , some such ministers possibly plan out deliber@@ ately un@@ useful notes , totally in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s paper multimedia campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ trial was a ple@@ dge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has won &apos;t be worth a value from the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street to its costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one as it did not were during Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .

in fact , there was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he had rejected cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e , because Bl@@ air had rejected the Princip@@ le on the EU which was rejected by French and Dutch v@@ oters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door .
the press has never missed that .

now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional b@@ ang@@ ar@@ b@@ ant and the wild fig@@ ure@@ of by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can &apos;t say anything about it Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , as the boy@@ sc@@ outs had batt@@ led on him , not to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anzler was a bad idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remin@@ ded me about the 70 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his old father worked on television to be loy@@ al to his Labour @-@ Cab@@ inet Director , without going too far , and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ aire &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; staying in all circumstances - &quot; Benn@@ ie &apos;s expression - was not that what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told , still what J@@ C told his co @-@ war and dep@@ u@@ ties after all of the reports on its c@@ auti@@ ous meeting on Monday night .
whatever the tou@@ ching Bott@@ om @-@ Up image of Cor@@ b@@ yn wants to mediate - remember that he even stir@@ s up - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and in the Stru@@ del Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and tre@@ ason .
it is right to put Cameron doesn &apos;t allow a free ticket for Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the paper dum@@ b , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins th@@ inks sure so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite specimen economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not merely a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic strikes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ity to Nat@@ o - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ is convinced that there will be no campaign for the outlet - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in particular , to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .

experts cri@@ tici@@ ze the report of Public Health England about E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
the claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched the Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence of the Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put up the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily great basis &quot; which established the PH@@ E his most important conclusion .
two more researchers have been writing in BM@@ J and have asked if the claims will be on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of references and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ purpose decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis , MC@@ DA ) , which summar@@ izes their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine products into a synthesis report ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , of which some are also specify a sector financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line of PH@@ E took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however no such connections or limitations in the PH@@ E report is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being responsible for PH@@ E , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ kers dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence is close to that the health Ris@@ ks of E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , however , that we still have to study long @-@ term effects .
PH@@ E has the un@@ am@@ big@@ uous source of information to the public about which the proof proves and what is not , especially if it exists as much public confusion about the relative d@@ angers in relation to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die yearly in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System 2 billion € per year .
through the clear pre @-@ laying of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give East@@ al@@ ders , former head of Channel 4
the former ch@@ air@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ alen &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs , which are not broadcast by other U.@@ K. transmitters .
he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC to as@@ cri@@ tici@@ ze public broad@@ caster programs which will probably be seen by a smaller audience , to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ val and broadcast live shows such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to put into contact with Channel 4 for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf , or sending it to the clearly un@@ conventional ri@@ val &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation into the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the radio fee , if you don &apos;t want to hold a good idea , or do not own production at least on programs , others do not make it or on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as possible broad support for their future .
the idea that else nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another yet , given by both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am acc@@ ord to see how this public @-@ law television is supposed to be .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC even at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC use &quot; upon Me@@ als &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the BBC will give the BBC everything the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ day@@ bed speech in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ i had to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal non @-@ legal programmes can go to BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t measure their tasks , but they can ar@@ gue , if they go through their apparent sacred missions to jus@@ tify $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , naturally , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ented programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I ask you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can receive the best value .
of course , remember all , think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is right for the 150 £ a lot of money , if this is true , because they didn &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ line and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC demanded her ter@@ ian @-@ mission mission to inform and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production is now officially categorized as Education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % in radio , and it should change to public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada , and so they should change and maintain . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and to make everything online available to make everything online .
&apos;@@ son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction at the moment in which it radi@@ ates with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically altered nervous system which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des represent the direction toward the moment in which they have sound@@ im@@ pul@@ ses , which have to be heard for human hearing to high frequencies , are ir@@ radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses are working through the power @-@ up of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive test which gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms .
fats are usually not respon@@ ding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , intensi@@ fy ultrasonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into wor@@ ms .
the intensi@@ fied ultrasonic waves effect on structures that are found TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ Ion channels and found in membran@@ es of some of the die cells .
the sound waves regul@@ ates the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and enable the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ one@@ tr@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels are toler@@ ated .
when he apply ultrasound to different creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ g@@ lass@@ y and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where it activ@@ ates the changed phase of motors .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn and off neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be lowered into the brain that needs to be lowered into the brain , low frequency ultrasonic ultrasonic can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain in the top of the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with com@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus is it possible to temporarily overcome human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a residence hall in a residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ ding sm@@ iles that I &apos;ve been off@@ ended - and to the many , bor@@ row@@ ful complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned , can be distill@@ ed in eight easy rules .
the train in student dormitories are ranging from slightly sp@@ lash @-@ breaking up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is more entic@@ ingly to slan@@ den : people tell whence you come , whether and where you have taken Sabbath day , where you hate about Cor@@ b@@ yn , and why you do not love c@@ est@@ ly , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s only one yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe out through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it bends up the conversation and helps you to find people out in contrast to those who wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyelashes would be consumed by fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often converted into drinks , film / night ven@@ ues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t think about start at the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ es receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student houses forming a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
it may be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing else allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to pass through our friendship , but you need to go away , that I have consumed the energy back , which I have consumed with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ one@@ al of dev@@ el@@ iness is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS to it instead .
ap@@ rop@@ os : do it . do it .
a guy in my student hab@@ itation had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship close by baking .
since you start the plain to the high point of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the monastery is set to the doors of people around themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to give you something like this , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade tre@@ ats offer is a good way to close friends .
her roomm@@ ates feel committed to enter@@ tain himself and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are an active b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps from flour , sugar and fat , do so that people sleep as@@ le@@ ep when you stop .
Ste@@ al to ste@@ al , is a universal crime in student halls .
of course , the hoo@@ fs of chicken are a theft , but is it a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they boil them in the interior .
if someone is anno@@ ying , is this anno@@ ying , and you have my sympath@@ y - but try to deal with a roommate than my roommate who added a deter@@ sive agent to pun@@ ish her milk .
she is now in prison .
you don &apos;t make noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about to be a constant human being , but that you are in the true sense of saying to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them something going to make the drum and bass something qui@@ eter , since it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they re@@ acted on it with more lu@@ cr@@ ative music .
when she stopped at 5 p.m. , she left her neighbours again two hours before she left her own music , shut up their door and under@@ go her three @-@ hour examination .
would it be not romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would be random@@ ly moving to the same student dormit@@ ory ?
vice vers@@ a , it would not be ab@@ dic@@ ted , if you take a roommate for your future married couple , to take it back , and to see them every day , as they may have to experience as all common friends appro@@ ached ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but when a hot co@@ hab@@ ator is definitely not your future married couple , try to speak a little reason .
in an exciting moment in which you notice that somebody has his key in his not locked room , the border between a bul@@ let and mo@@ b@@ bing seems to be regarded as it seems .
a good way is funny , but it only takes moments to bo@@ omer@@ ang up to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .

H@@ ousing Complex for Refu@@ ge@@ es , All @-@ Dest@@ ro@@ ying , Ger@@ ing@@ se@@ ve@@ er
the real estate business Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on a medium @-@ Fran@@ cop@@ al corner ter@@ raced houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ob@@ serving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how to buy cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are push@@ ing onto the apartment market .
entrepren@@ eur , Markus P@@ dner , believes , how rapidly can be created more affordable living space : it builds on a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push on the home market .
which solution can you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the defin@@ ite accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people stay in a big part here .
in view of the refugee flow we also need sufficient space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ quet , three storey building is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different , if one gets the people in dor@@ blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees are going to say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
the houses can then be converted easily according to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
guil@@ ar : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is worth € 184 000 , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the construction guidelines imp@@ lic@@ ated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : under construction , I thoroughly drawn my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always difficult to im@@ min@@ ent dig@@ al value special construction and the laying down regulation .
gr@@ ati@@ al .
it &apos;s still being subjected to anyone who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities lack the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the occup@@ ants react to their ter@@ raced project ?
Gil@@ das : there was that which was accused of creating luxury products for asylum seek@@ ers .
that definitely isn &apos;t correct .
but do you not shar@@ pen@@ ing the competition for affordable flats ?
Gil@@ das : it is true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but there were very luxurious apartments that can hardly make any more aff@@ ord .
my project has the message , including normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ se@@ ven@@ er alone .
I &apos;ve found how to buy cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and install the option .
some of the problems continued after installation , because they get an error message , which means that &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are recommended to wait to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght go or trying to update over iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may be able to delete apps to create space - but Apple has done so much more likely to do so if you need to install a special tool if you need to install a special tool if it is complete once the process is complete .
it pays to ensure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not possible that the update will continue , as the phone could lead to half way and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the updates .

one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and cried to them , that they should wait for him .
at that point , the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men had cried out with the yo@@ ungst@@ ers , and struck this with his f@@ ist on his face .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ nose and ble@@ ed heavily from the nose .

the latter had to be brought to a hospital in order to provide medical care .
until now there is only a v@@ ague activity description .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field and invests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen .
this is also pleased Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ ality Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promotion in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ sed Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
fortunately , in many different places on the country , Doc@@ tors - As@@ endorf said , &quot; Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of the field .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich joins his successor in the coming months still with half a point to the site .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller re@@ opened its practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at first glance , when the rock &apos;s rock met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently doing their dental treatment in becoming a hospital and will certainly go into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage should fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I was far , I simply called them . &quot;
using the couple Müller liked the idea to run your own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to experience and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own b@@ oss soon .
and so the gar@@ bage master purchased the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller has also grew up , followed up his medical studies in Hannover , followed by several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed as Senior Physi@@ cian in the district of Die@@ ph@@ olz and is working on honorary positions in the DR@@ K stand @-@ by @-@ read@@ iness @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice is prepared for the new b@@ oss .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ isti@@ ausen works as a resident , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialized in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage he@@ aters , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , would like to sett@@ le in denti@@ sts .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy gets out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasonic tests as well as long @-@ term and endurance EK@@ GS and need a communication room more .
the E@@ DV is also completely renovated .
a total of 50,000 Euros bears the gar@@ bage dump in the framework of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality of ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows how proud and glad we are that practice is passed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ ality Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 2,000 patients come to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into the practice of rock@@ stand , in the North German average medicine there are about 500 .
there is another house practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the territory of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no success@@ ors would have found , it would have gone too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever has visited hours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ough &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; by the way , the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force on the rock@@ stand takes over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with their f@@ are@@ well in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the physician practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship and mun@@ itions .
a little wonder , they feel already after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are often seen , &quot; says the intern@@ ist .
her husband is complem@@ entary : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; I have always pressed myself before gardening , but now it could be otherwise . &quot;
furthermore , the couple got two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are crossed at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are upright in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants your asylum request will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power supply and safety of the people are in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it takes distinct signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people should know that we don &apos;t accept unlimited migration flows , nor beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would also aband@@ on refugees towards Austria and Germany and establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
not so , this is the Minister for the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nig Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is already sharp@@ ly controlled as an external limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister st@@ ressing , Sloven@@ ians will therefore not make its borders for Refu@@ ge@@ es , but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; every EU member must fill his duties , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nig Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had gone over night , the first refugees trying to travel to T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to leave the registration .
the Croatian police could stop it in the lower Ma@@ is@@ e@@ fields .
according to local media , since then , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles with new refugees ever met in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
the Red Cross also uses rescue services and the Red Cross .
in the coming days his country has about 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo was deported to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serb border , which had previously applied migrants to the Hungarian border , with Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade qu@@ ashed away , however , that it was to suggest people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor we want to do it . &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees had arrived in the Serb border town of S@@ id , in the run of the day , more buses would expect .
across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants were driving around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made it , so the police have said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually be actually pre @-@ predicted shift from previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control &quot;
Croatian Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasi@@ zed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong audience of refugees , corresponding plans for possible execution situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not understand details , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one lead the strict insp@@ ections to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of the EU partners since 2007 , and since then the country has consistently carried out a good witness since the standard of border controls .
the Serbian path crosses still approximately 300 refugees after the Hungarian border crossing .
according to the media reports , they reported past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully closed .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , is still unc@@ le@@ ar .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic also tried to calm in Hor@@ g@@ os at a local jubil@@ ee : he has concluded the debates about alternative routes by refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no considerable refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could not say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
help of migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees which are found alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still no clear@@ ed min@@ e@@ fields for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the bor@@ der@@ region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , therefore we &apos;re with action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and Lie@@ ffer Gig@@ ant re@@ alizes its winning result for a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boxing transport service .
the company also said that it plans to make about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
F@@ ed@@ Ex announced this last year that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
the share fell to over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year that ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expect a pol@@ t@@ set of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , that will be aver@@ aged an average of 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4 , despite higher attacks for boat transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it nevertheless expect that the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online trade will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid earnings when people we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holidays have been announced a day later , as announced by the Rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million served 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research en@@ quired analysts predic@@ t .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.2 billion $ .
six of the st@@ acks were asked $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has achieved a drop in international pri@@ ori@@ asis in the last few years , which brought sales to its unit express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results in F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was essentially flat because of higher costs for bigger pack@@ ets and insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was sank to higher labour costs in the cargo sector .
in the market @-@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .

and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predic@@ t them . it is ready to predic@@ t it on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to dis@@ we@@ aned from an un@@ preced@@ ented incen@@ tive promotion rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is soli@@ dly growing , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets provide the already pres@@ elected F@@ ed representatives , this Vol@@ ati@@ lity , by the rise of the interest rate for federal bonds , and be it only for one quarter percentage point .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if you were looking for a pre@@ text , would not increase the interest rate , increased uncertain@@ ty around the global market enough jus@@ tification , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloomberg , a interest rate had predicted this week .
financial markets however expect a remote control of F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows just a 30 % chance of an increase .
this is pointed to a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are down@@ pour out , by promise that a further increase is far away .
for Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged for 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is set up in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would they go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , lest they fall into pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would be calm for financial markets , because it would act in@@ security when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a de@@ cel@@ eration of monetary policy that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase economic growth , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level which looks F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage increases signs signs of recovery .
while inflation was constantly falling under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative spoke , that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world joined the end of last month after China had proven its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial overall average was more than 16 % among its highest levels when investors feared that a slow@@ down in Chinese economy would be global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , with the Dow Jones located just about 10 % below the May .
for the F@@ ed Representative , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when you increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events would not have occurred on the financial markets and the news about weak@@ nesses of the Chinese economy within the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ a Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Sec@@ ond@@ bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertain@@ ty about what the effects on US economy be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is one of the main advantages of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere label of the then Director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close its mon@@ et@@ le expansion &quot; cr@@ amped &quot; rapidly , dissolved per@@ plex@@ ities around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ linked by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments on other site , but also with other central banks and experts advise to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the Global Strategy for Net Management of Company En@@ cryp@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , note that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transition to financial market movements that are not linked with economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
h@@ acker , authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , imp@@ lied on for an interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought F@@ ed to reduce their guiding rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited importance to growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed @-@ representatives accounted for these cuts .
F@@ ed should res@@ ume aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market crash in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ences are not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly will not st@@ ain the situation in which they are afraid of interest ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozn@@ an , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and not mentioned the financial stability , and until that is modified , I don &apos;t think that it would take time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small help for refugees
to date , more refugees are coming to Germany in this day .
to prepare you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole range of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in town .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with the body and soul teacher .
she also teaches with her 74 sal@@ ts .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
there , they will help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo , and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , that is completely different teaching as at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy styl@@ ing
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women on how important good nutrition is involved . it does with the presentation of babies that are painted to breaks , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates , that give babies all nutrients needed to build a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation , which should be given to mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was actually per@@ tin@@ ent to inhib@@ it the genes of her babies and protects them from the evolution of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports hall
the assembly of the church of Bern@@ ried appro@@ ves the construction application for the 2.3 million Euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat to solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are prog@@ ressing step by step forward : in the youngest public meeting , the application was approved without large discussions .
the Committee had previously planned an application for a special statutory &quot; exception &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
in the &quot; exception &quot; it was permission for a special form relating to the roof construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ add@@ ress@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must therefore be built with non @-@ cent@@ ered First and attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the background of planning , the planned use of the roof area for solar energy systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large sou@@ dd@@ ach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger , sitting in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; Liberation &quot; again , it was again around the umbrella due to energetic grounds - differently than in the construction plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not permit a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Excep@@ tion@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the name of the Municipal Council generally de@@ duct for freedom of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no recur@@ ring project with this turn@@ around project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports center at Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants will be expected from school and l@@ atitude .
in the next process of proce@@ eding , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre lobby is now presented to the Parliament and the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ves is to be closed in early March - 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of employees withdraw from P@@ ei@@ ves to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ scapes , the Land@@ itu@@ ar Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision tou@@ ches the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would continue to be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority met with fishermen and the further existing station after Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , which cannot be with Sch@@ ong@@ au , shall be offered in a home in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which is only introduced since the beginning of the beginning of medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now entering a private practice near the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the question , who is to come into follow , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entered the game that is willing to take over from October 1 the lead and take turns with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the Haus in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this event takes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in every event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and def@@ ibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
transitional measures for the next two years is to bring together with his team when the Supervisory Board is finally able to carry both houses , until the next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which still has more than 35 beds , finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county has planned that for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation of the hospital in W@@ eil@@ heim , which is currently ongoing .
re@@ comp@@ atri@@ ate J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors of the house which is owned by the federal government , will soon be used as an accommodation for asylum applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I slept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like living with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there may be more consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term maintenance of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ om@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says S through the St@@ asi @-@ Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , which was received positive and very understand@@ able by the staff . &quot;
a genuine perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as Chief Executive Officer for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ves ( once 100 beds ) was once again threatened again by closure , departments were closed , for example , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the bund@@ les of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Lion are today called the evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) on the Berg@@ ischer HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal was the clear favourite , however , there is none to lift up there .
in the past season , the bath@@ ers in the B@@ HC have been suffering a pain@@ ful defeat and have a bit dirty .
hunting area with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two Trac@@ tor men have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the after@@ no@@ ons .

a susp@@ icious , the police have mixed aged 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate for Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the yo@@ ungst@@ ers killed and their dead are thrown into a canal in rock breaks .
a 16 year old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate already missed the victims of the victims of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kaiserslautern , as public prosec@@ utor and police informed on Wednesday .

in terms of the circumstances of reality the further investigation may bring .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ned of apartment gap
the location on the German residential property market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the home market grows .
the social housing structure is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German residential market have recently begun .
with the upcoming refugees and unemployed persons from the EU , more people are push@@ ing onto the market , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with major revenue citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable apartments , up to 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
a study on behalf of the association &apos;s association &quot; social housing &quot; comes to this result .
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
that means there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are not obliged to live more than asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many get in the home market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes before the rental apartments .
according to the Statisti@@ cal Office ( last year however , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers are rent ) .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not just about the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant ens@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany Sho@@ oting a private deficit which is become bigger one year ago .
at the moment , approximately 77@@ 0,000 units had already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals lived in large cities in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel M@@ om because of the f@@ lau@@ te in the home market .
in the large cities the number of square meters per capita has decreased for the first time in the past years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Apartment building &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
to create new incen@@ tives for social housing again .
this could not be disp@@ at@@ ched on the fundamental tax tax and fixed by the fundamental tax for subsidi@@ zed flats .
according to the Cl@@ an , the attractive tax write facilities may be needed .
the funding program for Refu@@ gee accommodations in Kf@@ W Kf@@ W already comes well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the amount available to some 300 million Euros .
now the project could even be exposed .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia corridor corridor
according to Hungary , practically no more , there are more refugees to choose the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces going to grant passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous yet .
Croatia aims to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister for the Interior , and if it is necessary , we shall organ@@ ise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already a member of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the approval of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have to go down to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
over 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports on the Croatian broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had off its border for refugees at the fore@@ day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , make it practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning , Croatian police arrested the first round of refugees on Serbia &apos;s neighbouring EU neighbourhood .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came both with bus and Tax@@ es in the Serbian border city S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter all the f@@ ences .
meanwhile , the secret strips hi@@ des other d@@ angers : there are even tough mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
these min@@ e@@ ers should now rapidly create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border , there are hardly any refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 times .
shortly before the decision on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the conqu@@ ering and damage of the boundary between us as off@@ ender .
only 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the sentenced to five years and the deportation is out of the country .
according to the immigration authorities , you have received a total of 94 asylum applications in the newly formed border &quot; Tran@@ sp@@ oh@@ ours , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - on the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children , as well as two older people .
on Wednesday tomorrow , there were still 40 refugees .
however , no one has got any more possibility to obtain asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be turned over there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sc@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to eradi@@ c@@ ate .
they collected waste to leave the tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side last weeks .
pl@@ ywood were disman@@ tled and one of the recording in the bor@@ der@@ ort was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express the aim of this re@@ building .
Austria reach only few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the land also strengthens its border controls .
but in order to count the 20,000 migrants , there were still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the post @-@ trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , small groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
Mayor , &quot; collap@@ sed &quot; about the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people were station@@ ed at the entrance of the camp@@ ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany stopped off on Sunday but for the refugee flow with Austria un@@ expect@@ edly , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and offered the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au .
before , we have wit@@ nessed the un@@ wanted guests only once , with j@@ ump@@ tions and beverages .
we told you , we will bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
and it was of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very gr@@ ate@@ ful .
a man could not take it to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that really pleased us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train passengers were inc@@ urred on Sunday evening in Wels by ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , at the short notice of the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was disman@@ tled in front of the River W@@ ern@@ stein on Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally highly within the course .
the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , in a day before a branch of a branch of sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more z@@ ig@@ en@@ nia to us , a logical result of a apparent sacred policy :
instead of at the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the erection of structures , our Chancellor has officially adopted state of government , and publicly ad@@ or@@ ned the position of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ om of National Soci@@ alism .
the cor@@ related of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now fron@@ ted in the fron@@ tier areas with ch@@ ao@@ tic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those also , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised Land , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are invited , and welcome , nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a major challenge , in view of the prolonged refugee flows and the approaching winter , to prepare ourselves de@@ cent states for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be another greater burden - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad based on the Search for 35.000 Things
Konrad has filled all hands full with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to establish neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already given Konrad to handle in the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without major ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interior ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
overall , Konrad employs 85@@ ,000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ ian year .
to meet the number , more 35@@ ,000 units must be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 the countries will al@@ locate the rest of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has led conversations with the country capit@@ als .
these were as@@ sured of him , even for the upcoming Refu@@ ge@@ es to create Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports by Konrad .
tomorrow we will give a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , it should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
the asylum @-@ coordinator uses great expectations for the ORF event &quot; helping us &quot; in the ORF event . &quot;
upon the platform , individuals can offer cheap accommodation .
in addition , we are hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er cri@@ tici@@ zed the standards of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that there must be a certain height of the towel rack or size of the finishing .
for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; must be considered .
in contrast to the interior ministry , in opposition to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad Adenauer , Konrad wins with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , that man doesn &apos;t speak to the face no further into her face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convic@@ tion is its most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to cause costs , as they declared itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase your employee numbers on three to four .
so far , arti@@ stes @-@ search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz for a better distribution
first no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , as the people affected are currently under@@ going without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
further locations to their capability are supposed to be tested for emergency response .

Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ az@@ inger ( VP ) holds more pre@@ valence in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has as@@ sured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
further visits of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
but there is now the appropriate limit controls .
special trains with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
however , the seek@@ ers would however be associated with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by other EU member states , P@@ ehr@@ inger demanded more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now , Austria again leads its borders with controls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ it@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the approach of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a Matter of Time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ filter is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T company is moved , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be used to meet innovative , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine , in start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to be promotional .
at the beginning , S &amp; T will co@@ operate with the new neighbours - a lot of ra@@ inf@@ all promises - &quot; the next run@@ tas@@ tic is merely a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of 2700 square meters resi@@ dual in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it any requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade

actually Jutta wide wanted to grow a dog .
the project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old keeper of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ber@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now has some offspring in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , foot@@ wear and tra@@ p of various manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
several weeks had been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I long over@@ lay it for a long time I will open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a own site , to which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only woman in the capital of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
their fashion interest has enjoyed wide @-@ ranging from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I ride the most if something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , the woman can not answer with the last security .
perhaps it &apos;s worth it that a beautiful bag evalu@@ ates every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place to be called by the local residents .
this feature connects man@@ cher also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for ag@@ ger .
whether he &apos;s extremely interested in foreign @-@ seek@@ ers , journalists , male animals or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy , the candidate for the US presidential campaign have strongly opposed the campaign development .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the Cold K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate would come down .
the New Yorker , with the f@@ ake @-@ fashi@@ ons , is a no@@ tion in the wine village at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related with around -@@ ty corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in bal@@ ancing mode .
the K@@ all@@ urban journalist Simone Wen@@ del rot@@ ated a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers become more than its goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow feel exciting , but in its most popular species , it is un@@ impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ Town has an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous jumps , as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz Coun@@ ts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for dest@@ iny , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too , with the statement that he would certainly be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the King of the hearts .
although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also ten@@ dering the mind that Tr@@ ump , &quot; says a little Mo@@ or@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random lu@@ des the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt , within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - into German : the geber , says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the pat@@ ron@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ ump &apos; success story began 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the USA a local for gold dig@@ nation opened .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of real estate company was first floor work in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of Tra@@ gi@@ k : if you wish to return to the Bavarian State , the Bavarian State went back then at that time .
he did not absor@@ b Tr@@ ump because he was once charged without permission , had explained the Director of the Institute for pe@@ eling History and Folklore , Roland Paul , for film launch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it stands in contrast to the along the marked statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immig@@ rant in the United States and required the construction of a border to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as is pol@@ ated , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote met@@ ering ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a n@@ ée Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so out@@ going . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension activ@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as a cat owner , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz @-@ Heinz came for a visit to the church organ what was generally well received .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that cannot imagine me from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re fine it , if he don &apos;t know the election , because &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had in the US at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ dead Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and when President ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; yes , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els movie , inter@@ viewed for the plat@@ former , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ents , also in the USA consider the interest .
the Upper Bavaria district of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain farmer . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may obviously have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who received the bach@@ s .
the woman , at which Sam Wood in The Bachelor was finally landing at The Bachelor , was r@@ ins@@ ing in greatest secret .
and no one of the three still remaining girl is certainly not reas@@ on@@ ably priced , whether it is the one that received the last Rose .
but when we met Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently have shown a hint , who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have left their ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man , and called his sense of humor , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get your last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the player &apos;s play , who won the Bach &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
je@@ ans @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have experienced a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went down into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ Allah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite in@@ compatible , and I thought it in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visits last week made sure that Wood &quot; could be one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now reserved to him , &quot; she said .
and when being ques@@ tioned , who should choose wood when it was not , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a in@@ deci@@ ding between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent qu@@ eries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach had considered Hay@@ ne to the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a com@@ angel so lost as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed continued his true face in the dressing cabin after the play .
instead of grinding at the mill , instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Haydn in his Press Conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne has also encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who car@@ ed him to forget his pat@@ ernity privileg@@ ing and to worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ ine Hay@@ ne has died in a Pun@@ t , who was re @-@ established in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was definitely not the start , the Hay@@ den and his massive Australian sist@@ ence for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later re@@ counted the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not make any wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that has happened , just about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ den compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free v@@ oters are demanding the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the refugee numbers .
at the start of the FW @-@ autumn cl@@ au@@ r in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bay@@ erns Schools in Big wall@@ stadt , if it is not appropriate for many new students , &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the cooperation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get dist@@ aps in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the agricultural sector of the free v@@ oters will take place through Friday in the Fran@@ ca@@ sian Commun@@ e .
actually , different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free elect@@ oral meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , political asylum is applied for asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the institution of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as they gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elect@@ or@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers want to move the free v@@ oters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ anger also demanded more staff for administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FW @-@ b@@ oss has not critic@@ ised that several states are consistently consistent : &quot; we w@@ alled federal standard standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is push@@ ing off , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must be professional . &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ long tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : educational policy .
at the new school year , Ministry of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot study &quot; Middle @-@ level plus &quot; with an extension of the secondary stage of three to four years - in the result it lasts for nine years until high school leaving exam .
that , Ai@@ v@@ anger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ Boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for voting for all high school students who want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police officers captured by demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police viol@@ ated the proposed Constitution against the proposed new constitution , said an official public on Wednesday .
the violence broke off on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approx . 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , guiding district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators have assembled outside a police station , with some of you cast stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police deployed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot down into the air before re@@ handle on rubber floors .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately obvious that , however , the used rubber floor , of which they may kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously has produced a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks non @-@ violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ness said that new provinces will be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , reducing their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed by country &apos;s country - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centr@@ alized by centuries .

under the pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Behr@@ ens finished by the System @-@ Bau @-@ Management in the offensive : &quot; we didn &apos;t have any questions asked to answer any questions , &quot; he said before the members of counsel and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has held around ten to twelve million euros and has been in discussion for months .
fier@@ ce reactions under sea creatures had come into the session , the pictures and new details indicate the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sea owner and board member of the An@@ nex@@ us , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will su@@ ck@@ le a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch which over@@ turns any other b@@ la@@ zy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as well as many other project critics , that the traffic would strongly increase by the intended amount of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all bus charges are coming , so that &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is exactly on the good one hectare big area of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have been conc@@ lusive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( Google ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ don@@ ate campaign to aid the 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees , as they fled from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ ou@@ d , a Google @-@ employee , filmed with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old when she had her personal experiences .
&quot; during our trip many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis has grown in Europe , many people seek my family des@@ per@@ ate .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Team , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global donations raised up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / contributed $ 11 million to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is con@@ fron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly over@@ weight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who do not receive @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in j@@ ama &apos;s Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss @-@ loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery may use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , obes@@ ity sur@@ geri@@ es have been proved efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as well , but most studies have been carried out using a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain dimension of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that somebody is obes@@ e , and people having a BMI of 30 are considered low @-@ weight .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and gast@@ ric duct - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BMI is under@@ going this operation , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI is with those who non @-@ surgical treatment treatments received approximately equal to 29 .
among those that go through a surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes is totally reduced by 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is totally reduced to only one percent , and partly at only about two percent .
Moreover , the results were in comparison with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ line , generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by some 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , says Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
research team also compared average results with the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased dec@@ lines in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete sur@@ ization of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the New Study shows no survival advantage in surgery after five years shows that Operation leads to a longer lifetime , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was obes@@ e people who under@@ go obes@@ ity surgery to die about 29 percent less than in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conven@@ tionally tested methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone , who is soo@@ thing for persons suffering from a BMI is below 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they say that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have to wait for long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated this genetic changes , having connected their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , it is really hard to reverse . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take away all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East came . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders demanded to termin@@ ate violence in the hom@@ etown of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of permanent refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech during the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which focuses on eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity must be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
it also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria encourage efforts to close the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly by education to be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about what the killing in their countries will be decreased .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the US came a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed myself con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his mo@@ tives were good , but he put on violence , and it was called the un@@ anticipated Con@@ sequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in intake of hand disinfection products by children over the past 4 years
gyp@@ sum control centers in the United States have reported about an almost 400 per cent increase in children under 12 , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic fermentation , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , increased the cases of revenue of handic@@ raft products in children under 12 years of age , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children &apos;s disinfect@@ ants drink inten@@ tional , while some are doing their friends to im@@ press or im@@ press their friends for the social media .
watch videos on YouTube as young people disinfect@@ ant drink only because of a budget experience .
adolescents have report@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic cold water to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there is disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice that are very attractive for children .
wall disinfection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the screening centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not have a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but humans let this hand disinfect@@ ant occur within reach of children , and when children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who has recently taken four sy@@ ringe after straw@@ berry fragran@@ t craftsmen in the school , was taken into consideration .
her blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered legally prescribed by adults , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who worked out at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah reign@@ s her words and was not able to go up when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors supervised them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl fell by the alcohol , and kn@@ itted the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ h@@ ai@@ &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinfect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
beyond alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some disinfect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women under the gor@@ ges of Han@@ de@@ des@@ infection , which contained a toxic , not de@@ clear@@ ed ingredient .
employees of health authorities have susp@@ ect that the me@@ thanol contained a le@@ thal solution , rather than ethylene of alcohol , which was noted as an active agent .
in January , three students of the Fourth class in New York State , their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher , pointed to their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; by ordering the anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom . &quot; thus , it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ de@@ des@@ infection and verb@@ al them from their space .
the police kept the failed plan as &quot; F@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and proved the disciplinary action to the school .

it is because the lea@@ der@@ ers are not there .

they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
you speak both teams together and that &apos;s what interests is interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to watch these games .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it grows in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million .
the result of Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent , with 5.5 percent , just like the figures for National Statistics ( for only ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the first quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , State Secretary for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell , commented : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland who has taken the historic decision to stay in the United Kingdom .

why I &apos;m trying to be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not pass , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ a@@ p is ec@@ aired by the po@@ ison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation took place first in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I approved .
when the day closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought , it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since often more applications are available as places , a spot@@ less lot@@ tery will take place to decide , who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it emo@@ tion .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit by Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend , with which I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot if we speak .
the Pr@@ ison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ part@@ n@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
she dre@@ amed that &quot; it would have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but it still th@@ inks that I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had the problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I would write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present an international re@@ porter , in order to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work is against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ e , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made .
I will not want to enter all the details here .
I can not say with security that Richard Glos@@ a@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would succeed him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is no sufficient evidence for jus@@ tify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from this perspective .
I cannot claim , really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ porter to which you can contact for it .
what you &apos;ll get of me is what it is called to die a man without unnecessary death .

before , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , in which the crowd had tried to win his stable .
&quot; over eigh@@ teen month , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart finished in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered to him a position in my st@@ ables , to provide information about what I would like in my livestock , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
you seem to believe that I am a bed .
if that is the case , they should certainly be able to gr@@ as@@ p their n@@ oses because they have failed to stri@@ ve for me .
Robert Rou@@ ch@@ ston , Former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ unders , CEO of Route L , were aware of that time and are still conscious of today .
should this be the mind that it is personally done ?
has the Route L gu@@ arded and perhaps people out of train@@ ers responsible for what is going forward in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there &apos;s outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that I say what I say to think about it now .
now I have arrived at the point , which the matter what is no matter , and that makes me sor@@ row@@ ful .
that really makes me sad .
I will execute the pressure on it and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can .
the fru@@ str@@ ations of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt screening at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he said &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ stable master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the full @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous , &quot; after a package slu@@ dge or tone has been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against rules of racing sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers didn &apos;t im@@ itate the leg on the leg .
it would have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day so it was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy may be con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with a pack of racing day . an investigation on this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make these rules , don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy calls for ri@@ vals to handle claim@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the ack@@ ling of his player as &quot; Agenda Setting &quot; of two Premier League favourites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Robinson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring@@ kämpfe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm wins in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a sc@@ arc@@ ely hit as the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern instance &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said they were focused only on their &quot; contact &quot; at the T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree upon him , since it was concerned that they wor@@ ried about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always comes up again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ es when they hit 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed all year nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les to a real focus , and that made us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he &apos;s probably not to lose it , so it was a bit a shock to him .
it is already strange , as this always appeared again in this season .
Bell@@ amy has re@@ lied on the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and its ment@@ or is remembered that Benn@@ y St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he did his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and , as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game which you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play as they play .
I build confidence because they say these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when the Big Games went on .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster has higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are coffee breaks and do not get any points ?
for me it is the game maps .
if they mention of us , it means that we will still meet on them in one phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has released this weekend , since they won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in the final Saturday night in the final round in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts off at the next day of service .
Serbia with 200.000 € deposit after drug acc@@ use
a man , whom perhaps a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence threat@@ ens to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , was granted to Queens@@ land , but was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police arrested 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which was released by South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was ob@@ serving , as he found his co @-@ accused in the J@@ ach@@ erin and met in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial abundance of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that there was no evidence of having to own the entire amount and that it might have been a harm@@ less reason .
the Judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the floods with Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated the court on Wednesday .
in the case of pen@@ al stationary , he exercis@@ ed the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic mother and boots had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach its release .
&quot; after reading the detailed explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan .
but the alone will not suff@@ ice to stop it , not to appear , war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damage , under the conditions that he had off his Australian and his Serb passport , at the police daily and stops at an cur@@ few cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident to A5 at Karlsruhe : manag@@ erial bridge fall apart
upon a tran@@ lap with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was bad@@ ly damaged at the Tuesday evening .
two of the three participating trucks had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in direction Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked too late and attempted to retreat in the last moment , as the police went out .
the Ab@@ origin@@ ator of the U@@ tility was complete apart .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to lock ph@@ oph@@ ile hi@@ ding pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when sleeping , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ sufficient images of children , which were sent by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using reports and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police informed themselves and saw the five images , then analysed computers , found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ research describing the terms in search of un@@ de@@ cent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g said regarding the officials , that he would have done it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ est oph@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to kill them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a view@@ point that it is ad@@ dic@@ tive to help people .
he gave me that the search was performed on the computer of him , said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to create ph@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the images and asked to send them more photos .
he said that he did so to temp@@ t them .
he said that he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he would like to see images of ra@@ pe and slaugh@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was we@@ eping and we@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then saw the def@@ endants on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , declared himself to have viol@@ ated the charges of the indictment , un@@ inhib@@ ited pictures of children on June 14 last year , and not before court to be released at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g will not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , as being argu@@ ed that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; will be found in his going .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael missing the judgement until October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case but was kept in temporary detention because of hear@@ ings .
he was still admitted to the judgment of sexual off@@ ences before the date of judgment .
bad soft to small border crossing to Germany
more refugees are out of the large check@@ points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many dra@@ fts away from fear of discovery and capture the people multiply on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the boundary of the river Inn , R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn has taken up more than 1,000 refugees at the Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn .
you were walking about bridges and bu@@ ds to the German side .
from there , they are taken by Federal Police in Reception and forwarded to registration .
following the return on Wednesday the Munich central railway station , the Federal Railway Station sets again considerably more refugees .
it arrived at the capital of the country alone until 8.00 hrs . , there was a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of insp@@ ections on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
Stuttgart : short@@ cut of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest awaits
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n before stor@@ my in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a high @-@ pressure @-@ area about Western Europe , warm sea @-@ air flows into the country , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the vig@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has drawn away the Atlantic ocean over the past few days , is called &quot; Henry , &quot; which has gone over the past few days .
heavy stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are expected primarily in Baden .
according to D@@ WD is still in the Black Forest in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the ground @-@ seek@@ er with bows from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , this will definitely look back to the sun .
the mass makes it : every two years the car train at the IAA sees its new products .
2015 is particularly well used in the compact car segment , which is currently especially well for sale .
cars from the compact class are currently being asked : approx . 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registrations was accounted for by the Federal Office ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this also reflects itself at the IAA ( public for public holidays , September 17 - 27 ) .
many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept automobiles and new luxury cars this year .
one of the greatest pre @-@ premier@@ es for the German car body is the Opel Astra , who will stand in the fall of dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
the Astra model should therefore also be well @-@ sold , therefore , the new Astra is not much more expensive .
Opel represents an entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current Astra will cost 16 Euro .
the Astra is with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only one @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already on display at the IAA .
and what next to the Astra at the IAA is still going to drive on new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra not@@ orious Mé@@ gan@@ e race .
at the fair the Mé@@ d@@ gan@@ e is only one @-@ fifth of a conventional and one of its sporty GT version .
at dealers he comes to the beginning of next year , then also a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : all new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan proposal aims to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti is fitted with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the supply unit is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , a world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
maximum torque is based on the manufacturer information at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno Festival in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renovated , the compact car model DS 4 is now visible at the IAA .
the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ën @-@ Ab@@ le presented his hand on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was provided here .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touchscreen while the first Apple Car@@ Play is integrated .
in addition , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I have been added to the IAA in the compact class as a compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has held an ex @-@ in@@ mate of Justice Te@@ gel , which was then placed on a small cell in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dig@@ nity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are housed in small cells .
this decision did not decide the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can therefore even be able to hope to money if they were imprisoned only few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
he was a former det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional reform in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated .
afterwards , the man , who had once again been transferred to the foot of his administrator , has been l@@ ayed in a bigger cell .
his liability announcement charges because of the irre@@ voc@@ able detention conditions against the Federal State of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Judge took up the judgment of the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eline Berlin and rejected the case to ren@@ ew the case .
she h@@ urt the man &apos;s human dig@@ nity .
k@@ amm@@ erg@@ ents now decides on the amount of compensation
even though legal reasons reported for the compensation period only a few days of arrest for the compensation , a compensation statement is given , it was called .
otherwise it would be a witness concerning the protection of the personality . &quot;
the member must now clari@@ fy the amount of money compensation .
the constitutional judges often have strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past .
thus they only said in April one prisoner , because he was imprisoned in his cell in his prison .
human un@@ worthy is to be a decision of 2011 , even the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
Moreover , in addition to a parallel incident in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional Court , the Berlin Constitutional Court , also confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then @-@ time K@@ lä@@ ger had over three months away from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also made head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , including ag@@ gression increases , even to massac@@ res , because it should already be a sp@@ anning location .
according to the information of justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel will not be occupied due to junior staff , 19 will drop in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany following the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in accordance with Germany . according to the statement of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absor@@ b a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated clarity in the face of the extraordinary challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this , and we do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview :
we needed according to different proj@@ ections from 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Health ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically is the lack of residential space but mainly with affordable rental objects : annually 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social flats are out of the rental price , and in order to attract these especially favourable dwellings .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding , currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to emer@@ ge , and therefore the Federation would have to invest an amount of € 6,4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal secretary are involved , that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of those who are employed in Germany should be employed in the long @-@ term .
however , refugees in Germany were not in demand for their quali@@ fications to help them start to help them , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education within the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they work in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the Society in the admission capital , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ ott@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ott@@ hardt , there has been a policy turn@@ around in Germany : from working for@@ giving for refugees to their recognition .
while it was an employment for@@ b@@ ade for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society - also because of skilled workers - in majority , the view has asser@@ ted that refugees should be faster than access to the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing German .
previously there is no sufficient offer of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are communicated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore based on thr@@ iller &apos;s thr@@ iller for employer @-@ integration .
the Berlin school management has found that only few fled their children into the Kit@@ as , it is estimated to be 10 @-@ 15 percent : &quot; for the troubled parents , it is only very important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zes , Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ person for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family from the advantages of the Kit@@ a , the administration of the bal@@ lot in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly climb by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - about by employ@@ ing more technical schools .
in countries , students are prepared for teaching at welcome classes in welcome classes .
they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers , who only have one qualification in German as second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ em from Berlin &apos;s school management .
the German Student Union estimates that around 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Federal country asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ led the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside Dep@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ ands ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
studies will@@ ingly could facilitate access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or con@@ fes@@ sion do not have any achievements after the asylum seek@@ ers Act more , when they begin studying .
the latter is generally not a BA@@ fö@@ G , since they cannot fall under the parties &quot; parties .
long refugees had to have been living in Germany until now , to be eligible for BA@@ fö@@ G , from January 1 , 2016 , this span will be reduced to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get BA@@ fö@@ G .
in future , Islam will play a major role , because many refugees are Muslims ; and the religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should over@@ look the same rights in Islam and the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State Churches right to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ country relationship .
important would also be the foundation of an Islamic welfare association , which car@@ es professionally for new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights and obligations belong to the rights .
accordingly , the representatives of Islam have to be in clear contact persons and willing to establish a certain control possibilities with the state in many areas .
this also includes the read@@ iness , controls against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany on Thursday .
those who wanted to penet@@ rate these conflicts in Germany , &quot; have their right to ref@@ using here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future integration , it will be much more than today a theme of all the society .
this will also have to change the majority of the majority , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be urg@@ ent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination body for a decade and a general equality law .
but it is very slow , as the NSU Trial Series showed , in the police and authorities systematically igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders are demanding a long @-@ term international agreement like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany , must remain in the coming years if the country must remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to medi@@ cally take care of the expected refugees , the medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as concerning Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we act this , &quot; he said the daily Der Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money are included in the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls on all derivatives in the registration of any health species .
services could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and long term , it is highly question@@ able to ex@@ pe@@ eling so many people with the limited liability company , the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , doctors must first create the language barri@@ ers .
as early as before , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are diagnosed with their diseases as well as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting them must be required .
many refugees were helped many refugees , but also with more common medical devices in ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee camps , there is clearly more untreated disabilities , and in the yo@@ ungst@@ ers go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
using the partially other path@@ ologies , German doctors tend to become clear , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to reco@@ gn@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and what concerns the trouble @-@ tem@@ com@@ motion , except for refugees , even in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans have produced a highly @-@ developed educational system , many refugees , even doctors .
in order to practice , they should have their quali@@ fications and possibly canc@@ elling examinations again .
at least half of the refugees came to Germany according to estimates of the federal psycho@@ therapy chamber ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulner@@ able is a refugee community , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich showed that the fifth Syrian refugee community is coming to Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress distur@@ b@@ ance , amongst others , suff@@ ers with so @-@ called flash@@ backs with respiratory distur@@ ban@@ ces , diz@@ zin@@ ess , heart @-@ pac@@ ed and death thro@@ es .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong terror and emotional di@@ vin@@ ity .
to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
yet , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seek@@ ers can make a request for psycho@@ therapy , however the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , non @-@ governmental employees or physicians who are not trained to mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
it remained unchanged , but the video of the Falls spread rapidly through the social media .

in this year , HP will share in two listed companies and separate computer and printers store from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its services activities .
the expected job of importance leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable more competitive , more sustainable cost structure to the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused when it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of businesses looking at transition to a new business of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as stand@@ alone company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy changing the changing requirements of our customers around the world .

FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb in front of the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasi@@ zed vs. Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and if his rehabilitation continues to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means , that Wil@@ sh@@ ere won &apos;t miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer of the European Championship are certainly un@@ sure .
the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury and then back to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury not injury the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it &apos;s one bone , which healed not well .
this is not a bigger aff@@ air .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with the kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries which he had previously .
this may be true from the purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there &apos;s the associated risk from further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different types of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played 157 league players in only 65 out of Arsen@@ als in the last five times .
the wider picture of ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs , most of the po@@ is@@ ors have taken place .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ el@@ ises , but it believes that an improvement in the injuries ratio will continue during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an adul@@ ter@@ ated period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope to stabil@@ ise his body , I am confident that he will do it and he won a career of the kind , which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal k@@ icks off its Champions League Cup on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ spur on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta can start in no way .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to g@@ ön@@ kö@@ nen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal reached a clear favorite group , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the largest b@@ ays in Europe with the largest b@@ ays in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
L@@ ess is the opinion that Arsenal had drawn the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from the far hope , with his management the association to its first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never been folded for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons through men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to what the need of men to open themselves , now even du@@ bi@@ ous than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dial amongst young men will prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death amongst men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in males than for women .
taking the effort to tackle the issue , the Campaign Against The Living Mis@@ er@@ ers ( CA@@ LM - campaign against an inher@@ ent life ) 2015 was announced , with the aim of putting the culture in question , to seek help , if they need this .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to cope with this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms set that if the suff@@ erer has a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; doubled their chances to recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends is the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have a friend to work with such a friendship .
in the age of social media communication , with its focus on the substance about substance , the in@@ compar@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , li@@ bi@@ ous and successful , doubles , even when domin@@ ates the insulation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ ater@@ restrial values call ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ular values - our internal lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affect our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire announc@@ ing , money can really not buy .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality inter@@ faced by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of hum@@ idi@@ ties of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler are frequent cap@@ tions , moments when lying in cozy S@@ ack@@ les and the lon@@ ging of Ross - all that comes from knowing that men can refer back to everyone , even if they often rec@@ ap@@ t to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of phone prec@@ au@@ tions , it declared : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my as@@ yn@@ ching role for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ threat@@ ening , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term prevention mechanisms .
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective si@@ ze@@ al status above the phone likes to help people in sight of desp@@ air also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central friendship with the celebration of the day completely re@@ arranged scenery , why do not take your friends to drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you sit in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone else alone you get a smile and tell you hello .
one knows no , what difference might your friendship be doing .
friends will be broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh &apos;s Cav@@ ani after his matches against Malm@@ ö .
our debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö in Malm@@ ö .
here are the g@@ ameplay report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh &apos;s Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who put the French master on the way , but thereafter it passes a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead than Cav@@ ani during the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they do not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Ro@@ unds , but an improvement on the road to the quarter @-@ fin@@ ches in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Fab@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ zi@@ ov@@ s , missed the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . thus , it is a good start to create and relaxed back , even if there are certain things that we need to have perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I didn &apos;t re@@ gre@@ t that we have no or two further goals . &quot;
after his injury during one of three changes to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team that ended on weekends a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on our own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was cut out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing@@ ers was referred to as the man , who was taking the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the last corner of the network .
but if any one believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic converted into a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle area rises a serious opponent .
but out of a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they did not see a bit in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had sometimes on , with some troub@@ les and bad dis@@ agreements , not least of I@@ bra@@ z@@ ovic , who was l@@ apped at no less than five trials in the first half , after Cav@@ ani had taken him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he pointed out much more skill when he brought his co @-@ players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was turned into a shooting sequence which was lowered by Wil@@ low in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate happened shortly after Cav@@ ani &apos;s hours . at the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans he made his sixth part of the season after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had caught a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
it ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö had come into the game , and just an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , which was able to have seen the end result , before substitute E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification plays are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do you do in the occupation of the movie and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ult@@ ed un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the comments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Mar@@ tian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Detroit tiger &apos;s loops on Minnesota Twin@@ s pass over
the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but did not play this part on Tuesday mut@@ iny against Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s sent a chance to climb to asc@@ en@@ sion within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , but only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to gr@@ as@@ p about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon conducted its early offensive support , as Detroit three times posted on the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times to the 1 / 3 inside and made it possible for three racks .
it wasn &apos;t his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I will quite concentrate on going into the game .
the newly designated tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ elling the stro@@ us good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said good@@ bye . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( p@@ unch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and it brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the Twin@@ s had their greatest chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ er Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed b@@ la@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y over@@ ran the wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was faced with designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who put a Two @-@ Run on the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing @-@ run in the second , betra@@ y the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was the major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe won a Double Play .
after being added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth place , Wall was able to install a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed st@@ allion was S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth place .
Detroit benefited from the beginning of the game of a still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tiger &apos;s hits were achieved three times in the first two inn@@ ings against the attack@@ ing veter@@ ans &quot; veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the play of the po@@ orer list , after having fallen more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt great when I got rid of it really good pit@@ ches out of the third In@@ ning &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after placing it in the first off the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single of Second Bas@@ ner Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right hand , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was eliminated from the game as he tried to come to the third one , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers came in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double von Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single von Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not sm@@ itten very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the re@@ lie@@ ver A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter .
I arrived at Hu@@ gh@@ es three times at six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : tiger R@@ HP An@@ ib@@ al San@@ chez was eliminated because of a violation of the li@@ f@@ ters .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability point because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , is intended to be activated on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the po@@ inting list to start against the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger , since then he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has served on the right hip joint for 20 August due to a force in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and Twin@@ s will stop their series of three games at target field on Wednesday

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military operations with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think about military action options must not take place without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; collective shooting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we had been glad that the cup came to a military involvement in Germany .

Austria controls South and Eastern Lim@@ its
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern limitations .
the Austrian Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared the Austrian TV station for the Austrian TV station , which is now returned to Hungary .
also Germany , no refugees have sent to Austria for Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement , after Germany could record a specific number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that he had given meetings between the Director General of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers not called them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria over the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied together with several other EU leaders and heads a special summit for next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
so far , the EU states didn &apos;t have to agree on a common approach in crisis .
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee trade in Germany the federal government wants to support stronger countries in the first and distribution of people .
after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the ministers , the Federation will meet almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister &apos;s office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need to protect them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but whoever does not have to worry , could not stay in Germany too .
this view was divided in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor st@@ ressing that the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; massive strength . &quot;
in the meantime , thousands of du@@ b@@ ted refugees have moved to the Balkan Route .

&quot; that &apos;s hard , Rama is a rob@@ ber losing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we must re@@ think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gra@@ f , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper , overlooking the possible commitment of un@@ qualified professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain plenty of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who like to consider that his sl@@ ender line will often tre@@ ad them more often .
as man@@ g@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy , the exotic fruits still are : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. , these include man@@ g@@ os but much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ otene .
those who eat the fruits , supports se@@ at@@ ters , immune system , and metab@@ olic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ g@@ os should not be too soft or firm , and smell .
the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about how the fruit is , so also green man@@ gan@@ s can taste very delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and within less days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
it mil@@ es the slightly bitter taste man@@ holes like Chic@@ ag@@ e and radi@@ c@@ cio .

first tra@@ w@@ stur@@ m , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , the pe@@ as@@ ers leaves the night@@ mare part of the hair dryer , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z was divided into Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer partly with storm @-@ strength due to the val@@ leys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ing on Thursday morning , we crossed a distinctive cold front which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind , and a temperature back .
like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive air @-@ area coverage of the British islands in a strong south @-@ west flow .
on the side of the Alps , the val@@ leys will break through the val@@ leys in the night to Wednesday .
in the wake of the hair dryer up to Thursday morning , the fittings can be isolated from 60 to 100 km / h , and in particular , in the ur@@ ard@@ land , partly with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can advance up into the adjacent Middle and mountains , and in the mountains are even or@@ b@@ bing of more than 120 km / h .
during the north on Wednesday a mixer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides the moisture at the Alpine slope .
here , rain is running , which lasts until Thursday night .
in total , south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this is expected to drop over large ra@@ info@@ s during the last days .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino in the presence of a hi@@ ther@@ less square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , the name of the German reform was christ@@ ened .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ olog@@ ian of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Protestant Churches of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants were able to live more than a minority in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , it is visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he received the town back then than perfect sin @-@ fork .
his negative impressions shall be strengthened by hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .

hammer Artist invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works created by the Ot@@ mar Alt in his b@@ ible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which now has appeared with magnificent photos .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations bib@@ lical histor@@ ies on paper and screen .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has won his &quot; language &quot; with coloured colors and imagin@@ ative shapes - what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the particular topics can be adjusted , which cannot be quite un@@ re@@ do@@ able .
for three years , Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subj@@ ective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles created are cycles that focus on themes like crosses , p@@ ments , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
he immediately fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which deals with the evidence of painting with the respective Bible lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the texts selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus into the present &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transl@@ ating into current context &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded in a set of Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible study and one sentence by the artist who clearly formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jew@@ ish tune is golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de in 1940 and grew up in Berlin from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant man@@ n@@ ist League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already taken with the tube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds itself Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up and to bear me again with the Father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in a fast life time again to more importance : &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds is min@@ ic@@ ated today by advertisement , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being forced .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss , things to show .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in that respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to bring the viewer over the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them stand , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday during the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ lies &apos;s art : &quot; I like it with his images . &quot;
old did not have to perc@@ eive the Bible completely , but also selected for him , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some pictures were written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler &apos;s Luther company , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ lies pictures speak for both the ( Biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented at an exhibition for the first time in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation on 15 November .
construction comm@@ enc@@ ement for the BM@@ X railway
plans made to fit in place , company set up , set the ground for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - yet still before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was finished again .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration provided for se@@ duction , especially in the inhabitants who wanted not to toler@@ ate the railway .
so Hill fro@@ sted , new place - now with a formal planning and application for construction permits .
the approval will go down in October . Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ goat is now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year , I have more visible , &quot; she said .
it then should be started without a &quot; further blu@@ epr@@ int &quot; when working with the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga dis@@ uses a distinct character in the weekend .
football is respon@@ ding to the leading position in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its help in the handling of the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one cannot say , which goes nothing , I do nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every particular interest in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he intends to discuss the situation in the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the law office and meet the State Minister for Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ outs need to set politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German football covenant has therefore expanded his refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented on the outskirts of the UEFA European Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some provinces support this program .
this weekend , the 36 pro@@ s have already set a sign of significant signs when it comes to the stamp to the left in Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ är@@ mel ( Hermes ) to provide the custom@@ ised ship name &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ aring Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure all that everyone should help , wherever and as they can only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ chief manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ si@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama works every one , no , no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot use football @-@ ch@@ equ@@ ists , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been unbelie@@ v@@ ably read , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of league . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women holds 100 refugees to Halle / Saale in this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach created the support of refugees as a &quot; large communal work in German football . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ en@@ ets had launched its own projects in their locations , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent there will be living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s of great importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ chief will lose an eye for an accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has said several reports , according to the down@@ fall of July , to the left eye .
at the accident at the stairs in the house its brother in the US , it was fallen to a water glass upon midnight , which he carried away in the left hand , reports the &apos; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &apos; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , then was wo@@ oned out into the street - which he told us so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted with SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can handle his work .
&quot; in early October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 year old manager should be at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , and he will come back to Germany in October and further .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I saw the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t commonly mani@@ fol@@ ds between Germany and the United States , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wal@@ dorf .

soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all the hopes of Marco Re@@ us com@@ eback in the first group game of the Europa League was finally broken .
the national player is missing to the table leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the W@@ FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t understand it , unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high intensity of his professionals Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position .
thus he announced a change to the door@@ step .
therefore Roman femin@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; he trained as an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the World Champion .
whether female f@@ eller will be used in the future in all Europa @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open .
with a high probability it will also dispute the second game .

robots : government wants to maintain leadership for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological pioneering .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which fore@@ sees investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Autom@@ aker IAA by a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
the automated driving and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less stability , Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt said .
he also wishes to discuss the topic with his counterpart from the G7 states , which come together with representatives of the industry .
the company &apos;s strategy paper is emphasi@@ zed among other things , the significance of mobile broadband expansion and a high @-@ rise building on digital radio stations .
to testing new technology , a test track at the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by so that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional harbor risks are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , Germany wants to make sure that the permitted speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers .
Moreover , the federal government plans to implement it for a change in the Vienna Convention , which far only sees people as driver .
with automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more for passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which process the environment quickly and effectively .
following a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study by 2025 , to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic officer of S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers must clearly be clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled car is still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute , on behalf of the Fraunhofer Institute , is that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will result in the coming ten years , 32 percent are expected to believe that 31 percent is not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents to 2025 are expected to be 33 percent by 2025 .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave a car on self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
a Digital @-@ Bit@@ kom survey would only accept seven percent , while checking the whole drive on all roads .
on the highway , this could introduce 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at least 45 percent in the traffic .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of big mo@@ th@@ schau and a wax cold @-@ cat@@ chy : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which seem to look terrible to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of fashion scene - and that he put male in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer tell you that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously , it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s really , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is on the 18th of September in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ cultural foundation , it &apos;s a good luck that the fashion designers has changed at a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made during the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which hardly belie@@ vable works of the man , which he has written , without ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not rebuilt , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographed total artwork , for which much effort has been run : to fresh@@ ise the doll@@ s , for instance , a styl@@ ist was involved .
14 tons of material have landed on the makers after the beginning of the Cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to Munich .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are swal@@ low as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier told them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers alter Teddy is visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , agile @-@ like fashionable chassis of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier told them .
to play with a doll , his parents had not allowed him to play .
the design of fashion is then brought to himself .
he steel hand@@ writings and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought this , but naturally .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
previously , we went to the long pl@@ ot@@ ters in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and lace rose in great quantity for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains the Managing Director of the Mo@@ screw Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important .
in the beginning of the pl@@ au@@ ding point , fashion has played a greater role , and was discovered now through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
REIN@@ HAR@@ DT is named a few examples : jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ des .
ever , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , has increasing popularity potential .
not for anyone who supplies a niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available .
we make up half of all the contracts already with us .
mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales are taken away .
private speci@@ als and also the wholesale accounts there are almost no more .
we barely reach our products with the customer in this way .
today , the mass goods will be much cheaper in the Asian region and are distributed almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , export , up to Russia and the USA are weak .
sufficient reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we perform a quality seal , which shows that we ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
REIN@@ HAR@@ DT adds : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
Professor designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at Schnee@@ berg branch of the West Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - the Faculty of Applied Art and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
a voltage field is created between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that must consider economically in particular , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only varied to maintain a client base .

&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .

XI flash@@ es forward to opening the economy wider for the world
the economy must open broad@@ ly outw@@ ard to outw@@ ard growth to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said to a group commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should stand to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business founders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central guide @-@ group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new spin @-@ ups to promote and reform proposals will lead new moment@@ um and vit@@ ality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of check @-@ down , relaxation of border controls , including public capital , and overhau@@ l of the hab@@ itation system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that are not going to ask for investment .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , since it as@@ sures the market a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring joint business environment and open the market , said the statement .
the government will also make control of the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that businesses will decide how to perform their business .
the statement said likewise to allow China border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer , open control sectors , further areas will be opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legi@@ timate interests of foreign finance companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is sim@@ pler for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by request the requirements and facilit@@ ated the application process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and professional judges , and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part , as reported in one after the meeting published .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value into space fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large space fish and thus allowing a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is responsible for the EU targeted working document , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects are missing industrial and environmental policy , with full force of sw@@ elling and infants , &quot; commented : Matthias Wolf sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of nerve gas for large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish had to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly bur@@ gl@@ ected today that on the basis of the force limit values around 50 per cent of the length cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.5 percent would be dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous .
in return for this sl@@ ack@@ ing , the EU hopes to fin@@ alize the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this however as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; for smaller peace @-@ fish , such as car@@ p is usually extremely low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ fl@@ ection man@@ eu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ highly toxic heavy metal which has enriched itself over the food chain in space @-@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities of the nervous system could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause im@@ bur@@ ns to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explained on its website with regard to the applicable limit values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the General Population &quot; is not expected .
mercury is especially available through coal burning in the environment .
according to a written agreement by the German Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck submitted more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , issued two thir@@ ds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around the river Elbe , Rhine and Danube should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited in the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish already included the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
