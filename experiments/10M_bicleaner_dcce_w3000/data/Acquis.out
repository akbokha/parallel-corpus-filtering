&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a t@@ iter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is to be dissolved in parallel to the previous year , but un@@ diluted international standard anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) serum or an appropriate comparison rate compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen D , the serum can be used with blood cells , do not react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of lenses according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ per cent in@@ flow of c@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells with a visible volume of 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .

under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS to depend on its extension the existence and living standard of millions families , which are fully dependent on the measures aimed at maintaining and extending the consumption of olive products in the producers themselves and in the non @-@ generating consumer countries .
in mind that olive oil and table oli@@ ves represent essential foundations in the areas in which the olive structure is common ;
with regard to the essential characteristic of the olive production , the ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ness of the harvest@@ ing and market supply is and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations in production , prices and revenues , as well as to very different producers ;
with regard to these things , these are special difficulties causing the interests of producers and consumers seriously , and the general policy of economic growth in the countries that lie in zones , where the olive structure is common ;
