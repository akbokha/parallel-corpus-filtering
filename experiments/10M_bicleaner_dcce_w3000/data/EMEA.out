it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. The thinking of thinking and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ma@@ dness . • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disease , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods an@@ or@@ mal@@ er high tuning ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy will be applied to the treatment of severe to severe episodes and for a preventive episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the drugs .
the injection solution is applied for quick control of increased in@@ corruption or behaviour of behaviour if the oral in@@ gest@@ ation of the medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can be used to use or used the melting tablets in patients , where the swal@@ low of tablets have been used .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose should be dismant@@ led in the same way as Ab@@ ili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of in@@ ili@@ fy .
this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; Neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells together .
Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole probably works as &quot; partial Ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ o is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but with a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ itter appears to activate the recept@@ ors .
da d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin to play a role in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , the activity of the brain is to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize the psych@@ otic or lack of symptoms .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , which rest@@ art the symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a placebo period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy were over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo which were re @-@ evident in 160 patients , in which the lack of symptoms were already stabil@@ ized with ili@@ ating fy .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which were compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ikum ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and the solution for inser@@ tion ( receive ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received in@@ ili@@ ent in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly greater reduction of symptoms of sympt@@ om than patients who received a placebo .
in the application for treatment of bi@@ polar disorder in four of the five short @-@ term investig@@ ational symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition , down to 74 weeks more effective than placebo had been treated more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and if there was additionally given to an existing treatment .
in@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo perceived symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy for inser@@ tion ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ cur@@ ous dist@@ urban@@ ces ( nau@@ gh@@ ty ) , vom@@ iting ( nau@@ gh@@ ty ) , vom@@ iting ( nau@@ ght@@ iness ) , fatigue and vom@@ iting ( increased sal@@ i@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ness , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep problems ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and serious inci@@ dents in patients who had mainly lack of episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted an approval to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a licence for placing on demand in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used to treat high @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar in@@ disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly German@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ o z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherap@@ or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar in@@ disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has been proven .
with retrospective view of the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered to be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors are just@@ ify ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing is derived from combination therapy , the arith@@ met@@ ic@@ yl@@ dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icides reported to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ection@@ aries and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased risk of su@@ icides have been compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ mir@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care of patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( my@@ cot@@ ine attacks , cardi@@ ovascular diseases ) , shred@@ ding disorders ( de@@ hydr@@ ation treatment , h@@ yp@@ ovol@@ t , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ er ) or hypertension ( including jack@@ ets and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

when using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients were signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ gest@@ ion , should be applied to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has been signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without having an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be depos@@ ed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ o z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ans in the am@@ bush , or at stands that are used with cor@@ nets in the context of being used with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene in patients with p@@ sy@@ com@@ ers associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable fla@@ as@@ cul@@ ous events with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extrem@@ ly and associated with k@@ eto@@ ed or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related un@@ desirable events that were treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .

a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is well known , or a healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , cau@@ tion if Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole is combined with alcohol or other centr@@ alised drugs with over@@ l@@ apping side effects as sedi@@ ment ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , but this effect will not be regarded as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased its AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects have to be made , and that &apos;s why the similar dose can be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma con@@ cre@@ ations compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you want to consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , can have similar effects and therefore , similar dose can be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dose before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ p@@ yl@@ benzene per day did not show any significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ color ) , and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ wel ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they become pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data for the security of humans and due to the concerns in the reproduction of the animal , this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the possible benefit just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
as well as other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including force vehicles to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or have been classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the number of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ina , D@@ yst@@ ation and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ con@@ ia therapy .
man@@ ical episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ error - In a controlled study on 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ zol@@ amide treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS affects 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ time period of over 26 weeks during a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ zol@@ amide treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically clinical changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally or deliber@@ ations have been observed with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
indeed , there are no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ b@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that check @-@ in in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of benefits , because Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ error about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ver@@ gen and the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ och demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study conducted in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of the response of the Respon@@ se @-@ patients who held a response to the study medi@@ ation in both groups ( Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values made from Meas@@ ure@@ ments which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly greater improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene Group and 57 % among placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ con@@ ed in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patient interest rate ) showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ co@@ trials involving more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ error , Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo compared to placebo in 3 weeks of reduction .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy research over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I error , Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole showed no exc@@ essive effectiveness across placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar or mixed efficacy in week 3 and an increase effect that was comparable to placebo or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol per week 12 .
in week Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the Man@@ ie as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with man@@ ic or mixed @-@ related episode , which was partially reflected on lithium batteries or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy over a few weeks , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficiency when reduction in lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over a period of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over a period of 74 weeks before Rand@@ om@@ isation during a stabil@@ ization phase , Ari@@ pi@@ o z@@ ole showed placebo in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ie .

the average elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene in extensive met@@ abolic rollers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ oning via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ gen@@ etics , between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination , sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific analysis to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics returned no indication to clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic cleansing or the impact of smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ gen@@ etics of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ benzene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure , compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose of study with subjects with different tomb of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect as regards the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function at the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw s@@ me@@ ats on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ sh@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reprodu@@ ci@@ zed elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to the can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data had no special haz@@ ards for men .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only for dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects recorded a dos@@ ages supplem@@ enting tox@@ icity after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds with the recommended maximum dose when people ) and an increase in female rats ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ times the average steak state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for quick control of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al problems with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not attached .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ o injection solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ mir@@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
in order to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection will be recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ id , or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into consideration the drug or acute therapy to be given ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further leading treatment with Ari@@ och is inde@@ xed , see the summary of characteristics of the medicine using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y enam@@ eled or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inser@@ tion .
there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ ingual injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems which were different from sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in case of a fixed therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the arith@@ met@@ ic@@ idal injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedi@@ ment or a blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
examinations for safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ ingual injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or medication ( by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ mir@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care of patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( my@@ cot@@ ine attacks , cardi@@ ovascular diseases ) , shred@@ ding disorders ( de@@ hydr@@ ation treatment , h@@ yp@@ ovol@@ t , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ er ) or hypertension ( including jack@@ ets and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is well known or a healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , among which 460 women have participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used a Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a few gift or as a mono@@ co@@ ax@@ el ) was compared with a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated in the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
only one considers the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicine and the survival of disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane has been used as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
it may also be applied to patients who are silent or before the onset of treatment low Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ is in the blood .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane accounted for the first treatment not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ drugs and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained the medication not to be given to any other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission for the Automotive xis Bio@@ Science Limited issued a permit for the launch of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sen@@ sor@@ ption N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in case of sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 the treatment is to be interrupted by a rise to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments for patients with mild to moderate awareness of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies in patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to in@@ compatibility and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ amide formation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be cancelled immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no longer Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , up to the neut@@ ron number again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cycles has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
during a plain with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ovascular disease are not unusual , especially in patients with former Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , they can be treated with the usual Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ika and con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ing means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant or in women who do not practi@@ cing an effective conception of contra@@ c@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be enriched , whereas , and up to six months after the treatment no child can bear .
male patients should be advised before the treatment over a sperm con@@ fer , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects as ti@@ re@@ dness ( very often ) and Schwin@@ n ( often ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
in the following are the most common and most important events of adverse events performed in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important po@@ ison@@ ous tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ ic ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized phase III study study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion in about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ central study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ as@@ ax@@ el , which received a 3 @-@ hour inter@@ fusion with a drug treatment of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
during inclusion in the study 64 % of the patients had an adverse general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ est@@ amps .
14 % of the patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time up to the progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity across P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy to a periodi@@ c N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie level 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y at Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ul@@ ative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and continues to be unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total value P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ids took up in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cul@@ ous distribution and / or sof@@ tw@@ ater to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane when compared with a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ related P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) as a solvent @-@ related P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el inj@@ ector , and also the distribution volume was higher by Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abolic in the first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller met@@ abolic rollers ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma amounted to 4 % of the total dose of less than 1 % of the total par@@ abolic 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to an organic drug , that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it contains the same active ingre@@ dient ( also called &quot; Reference Practi@@ ces . &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron comp@@ lications , in which a blood circulation of blood is not possible before the procedure and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
treatment with deriv@@ ative must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , experience in treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the drugs .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ ject to a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or his coun@@ sel@@ or , if they have received an appropriate manual .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
iron concentrations of all patients are to be treated before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is made , and ice @-@ dietary supplement should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or when patients with kidney problems may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or so that the body is not sufficient to meet the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a loss of blood losses .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with a v@@ ein in a v@@ ein in the context of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference agency .
all patients with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been injected at least eight weeks before returning to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
in addition , the company also investig@@ ating the results of a study in which the effects of patients were evaluated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentrations of patients suffering from se@@ amed patients were maintained in the same measure , as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse event of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , ste@@ am@@ using heada@@ ches and per@@ vert@@ eb@@ rates .
se@@ duc@@ ers may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because other studies are necessary to ensure that this by no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) at the conclusion that the medicine has been produced in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and safety profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

alle@@ g@@ iti@@ oning symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ts may vary depending on the age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , some patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values above or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
given that hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability should be tried on a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , in order to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust @-@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded during maintenance therapy , under section 4.2 , the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
according to present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ em@@ y with ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa with kidney failure , which are not subject to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the risk of kidney failure .
in tumor patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients who need to be trans@@ f@@ ated ) .
if the h@@ b increases greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a half @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical @-@ related an@@ em@@ y - dose adjustments with the goal to keep the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a profit risk reduction under involvement of the respective patients , which should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for an overall elec@@ tive emergency procedure , if possible , in front of the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ em@@ y are examined and correspon@@ d@@ ingly treated .
patients suffering from an enlarged a@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , since they have increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic diseases and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an output em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be increased risk for postoperative pain / vas@@ cul@@ ous events .
in several controlled studies , studies have not been proven for ep@@ et@@ ine that they could improve the total survival in patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduced the risk of tumor om@@ ies .

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can come to a slight dos@@ dependent increase in blood @-@ dependent increase in the normal treatment area that forms itself again with further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests to control the number of blood pl@@ ets in the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron man@@ gel , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fol@@ lic acid , should be taken into account and treated before the start of therapy .
very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ Atlantic ery@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ia after months and for years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin detected ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in .
in case you suffer from ery@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ia , he will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and define how your com@@ modities is treated best .
therefore , se@@ amed through injection has to be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated due to kidney disease due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value reduces the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
if increased or increasing pot@@ assi@@ um , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ duc@@ er , until the pot@@ assi@@ um are back in the standard range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin level does not exceed a certain value .
according to present knowledge , the treatment of blood arms with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al suff@@ iciency ) , which are not subject to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the risk of kidney failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the evaluation of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will periodi@@ cally determine your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and change your se@@ amed dose according to the risk of a blo@@ od@@ rop@@ ic event ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as possible .
this risk should be very carefully wav@@ ed from the treatment with ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa , in particular if you have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have already bl@@ am@@ big@@ uous vas@@ cular events , e.g. a deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or lung bu@@ lie ) .
if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances may affect the tumor negative .
if you have an important orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of treatment with se@@ amed the cause should be examined and correspon@@ d@@ ingly treated .
if your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not receive dis@@ sem@@ amed because an increased risk of blood gra@@ ft after surgery is made .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines / apply or applied recently , even if it is not covered by sp@@ elling medicines .
if you use Cic@@ ar por@@ in ( mean to supp@@ ression the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ ar .

Ac@@ last@@ a is applied for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones ) both in women after the exchange years as well as men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ grant risk ( bone fra@@ c@@ tures ) , including patients who have suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hil@@ ation as in patients . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a sickness , which changes the normal extent of the bone weak@@ ening .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get received at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) just after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ ps similar symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ che .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
because the active ingre@@ dient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ om@@ eta was attracted by Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and it was examined by the number of vert@@ eb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis for over 50 years , who had suffered a boun@@ ty structure ; it was investigated the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( a enzyme that builds bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood again and decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ ine was reduced by 70 % for patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ akers ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ akers ) with those among placebo the risk of stro@@ kes was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a questionn@@ aire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the adverse events of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days of the infusion and are less often less frequently .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ orus or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the infusion of kidney disease and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ zeb@@ ox ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides a clari@@ fication material for doctors , the Ac@@ cum@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who are explained and referred to the effects of the medicine in which the drug may apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a European Commission for Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ poor Limited granted approval to the European Union of Ac@@ last@@ a in the entire European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men is recommended an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg Ac@@ last@@ a once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic stro@@ kes , the appointment of the In@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip is recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get you should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of murder with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long rate of prolonged period was observed in patients who have observed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently determined low @-@ traum@@ atic stro@@ kes , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ infusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by a gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended , as limited clinical experience of these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) An dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents Ac@@ cum@@ a is not recommended for use in children and yo@@ ung@@ sters under 18 years of age , because data are missing to in@@ compatibility and effectiveness .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because these patient &apos;s population is limited to limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ thesis is before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a due to adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid deduc@@ ting of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary sl@@ ender may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

ren@@ al @-@ irrit@@ ation Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as a ren@@ al ren@@ al , expressed in connection .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney disease as well as a restricted ren@@ al function was similar to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis for three years compared between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory round , the temporary m@@ n@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic values indicated below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip and in the mur@@ al @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D mirrors have not been measured as rout@@ in@@ ely , however , the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the appointment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to the infusion of the infusion , such as Romans , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .

treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ last@@ a reduced BS@@ AP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value for 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors have not been measured as rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .

11 . efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the dose of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain flow compared to the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at was observed after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sibility of the age of six months ( on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 in patients who were treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be treated at 141 of patients treated with ac@@ ron@@ a compared to 71 patients with a mean duration of a follow @-@ up period of 18 months after applying .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independently .
thereafter , the plasma pillar rapidly increased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

the early distribution phases ( α and let , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and views over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose administered in urine , while the rest is bound to bone tissues .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of caused by cy@@ to@@ g@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme , is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic in humans and because it is a weak or even a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

a summary of the EP@@ AR to the public this document is a summary of the European Public Development Report ( EP@@ AR ) which describes the work carried out in the field of human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to reach recommendations concerning the use of medication .
Ac@@ tos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic medication ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with a different diab@@ etic medication ( du@@ al therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , that cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ yl / insulin or insulin , the previous dose of sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ s or insulin may be retained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ s or insulin delivery .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be recycled and sin@@ king blood sugar levels , so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos were examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy and patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ material , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows blood glucose levels in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy studies , the effect of additional charge of Ac@@ tos in an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ ative material showed a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional charge of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin have been examined , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients who took in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual imp@@ air@@ ments , infections of the upper respiratory passages ( cold reviews ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ an@@ aesth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to z@@ zen ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , yet in patients with liver problems , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or diab@@ etic c@@ eto@@ ed ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission issued an approval to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited issued a approval for the account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ compatible with the met@@ form@@ ations due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) .
there is no data available for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. prior heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure could begin to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
the patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or ec@@ de@@ cks , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserves .
the patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and ec@@ de@@ cks , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing genetic disease was carried out .
in this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver values are as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that point to a conventional dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , appet@@ ite , fatigue , appet@@ ite , appet@@ ite , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to check the liver values .
the decision to determine whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is expected to be conducted by the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be so@@ iling of fat deposits and linked to some cases with a liquid .
as a result of a ham@@ bur@@ dening under the therapy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a slightly reduction of the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and at lower extent also in patients with sulph@@ ur@@ ism and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin content , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale two or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur@@ ylic acid or as a two @-@ combination therapy with insulin delivery , the risk of dos@@ dependent mort@@ ar .
after the market launch , under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular de@@ cks , but dis@@ ord@@ n@@ ating doctors should be aware of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , when patients may report on dis@@ ruption of visual acuity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ologic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events of randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated pre@@ fix incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardi@@ ovascular events , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients ) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes or leave a pregnancy or def@@ ends the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the inter@@ actions shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical production of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines prescribed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium Carbon@@ ara and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ kt@@ as@@ eh@@ em@@ mer are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ mine ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ Indu@@ ctor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ast@@ ero@@ on and increased insulin resistance of the matern@@ ity is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the f@@ ond growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ctive index of the lens as well as in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the three times the upper limit of the standard range is often equal to less than placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups of met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ material .
in an out@@ come study with patients with advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular condition , the frequency of a heavy heart failure was reduced by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was less than placebo .
since the market launch , rarely has been reported on con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure .
it became a summary analysis of messages irre@@ plac@@ ements from randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparable medical groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of the PRO@@ active trial , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment .
during taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days stood no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to work on an activ@@ ating specific receptor ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ation by Rec@@ ep@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive stability of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton mus@@ cular cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ de versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to assess the period up to the subsequent therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years of therapy , blood glucose control could be defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ized with insulin , in spite of three immune phase , to pi@@ an@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced the value of 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who have continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ ation compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy of 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , limited examination of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ de the total plasma gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to placebo , a statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ de was observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de mirror , this is also reflected on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as to the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ active study , a cardi@@ ovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , in addition to existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardi@@ ovascular therapy for either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ded , with the top concentration on the un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &apos;s plasma is usually taken 2 hours after application .
this basis corresponds to the post of M @-@ IV for efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical production of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin effective .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els , pointing out that the blood sugar level has been lowered as much as with other human@@ kind .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be sensitive to human @-@ quality ( allergic ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be derived from blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes exceeds the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a grant for Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S and granted approval from Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to the entire European Union .
Pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily if a rapid initi@@ ating effect is required together with a longer persistent effect .
the injection needle must be used under the skin at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the whole dose was injected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by a more intense insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type , long lab@@ eling ( ins@@ ist insulin , human insulin or insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in animal origin ) can lead to that a change in the dosage is required .
in case of changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , a dose adaptation can be required during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions emerged after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travel , which are over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to catch the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken in meals at other times .
therefore , the physician must therefore take into account possible inter@@ actions on therapy and tested his patients to others adopted by them .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients who may be sensitive to human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a grant for Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S and granted approval from Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin have to be mixed , first the amount of insulin have to be drawn up , then the amount of insulin delivery .
3 In case of switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , a dose adaptation is required for the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or months after the conversion .
before travel , which are over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to catch the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken in meals at other times .

Aden@@ au ic is applied for patients who have already been signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or poison marks ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . large pri@@ mor@@ ation deposits , which can lead to joints and bone damage ) .
if the ure@@ acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to a dose of 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , patients can still occur . therefore , it is recommended that patients have to treat at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for the prevention of plaster .
the drug is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three types of Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( placebo @-@ medic@@ ations ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ y ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ au ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg per day .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary level of blood was under 6 mg / d@@ L in the last three measurements .
in the first clinical study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received Aden@@ au in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily amount to 120 mg , whereas the last three measurements had a acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / d@@ L .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ au ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ ches , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( N@@ au@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart failure in the history , possibly a increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in the blood of blood acid as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hypertension in diseases which have already been led to urine ( including one of the health history , or present , present , and / or plaster ) .
if the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid level after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ Mol / l ) , a dose increase may be considered as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( one disease in which the bones incub@@ ate ) are used for women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , drink or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplem@@ entary agents ) .
to avoid a stimul@@ ating power supply , the patient may not go up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published in the published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in order to reflect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D sp@@ asm .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D intensity was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at revenues ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that the algae content contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is equivalent to the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ ches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( digest@@ ive problems ) , con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ vin@@ ity ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ ity ) , tor@@ mented abdom@@ en ( bon@@ net ) , tor@@ mented abdom@@ en ( bon@@ ed abdom@@ en ) , as well as su@@ sten@@ ance .
in patients with et@@ ric sensitivity ( aller@@ gy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied for ill@@ nesses of the feed , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ em@@ y ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can not stand upright in at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . granted approval for the announcement of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
capsule shaped capsule white to broken white tablets , lab@@ elled with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only covered with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin add supplem@@ entary food ) to the day .
the following information are to be precise to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ite irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swallowed up after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , since there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patient should not take place ahead of the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

ec@@ es@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as ec@@ es@@ ha@@ g@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms that point out on possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain when swal@@ low or retro@@ spec@@ tion pain or new or deteri@@ or@@ ative so@@ d@@ burn the drugs or to take care of medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant effects seems to be increased in patients who are not appropri@@ ately and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point out on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing assign@@ ments to be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ used clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , an increased risk of risk were rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ nets and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ a , among them some serious and comp@@ lications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the deriv@@ ative of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate surgery is reduced , the risk of an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor is author@@ itative for the therap@@ ies of every patient on basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should have taken the pill on the next morning before taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their se@@ al@@ um@@ ber .
they should not take two tablets a day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases which imp@@ lies the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ re@@ oi@@ etic ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale drugs can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medication , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy nor by nurs@@ ing women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not allow an indication of directly to the disease that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports were reported by cancer patients but also reported on oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ ants .

res@@ or@@ ption related to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after an empty stomach and two hours before recording of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ udi@@ en , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day was taken .
in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) resulted in no clinical change of oral bio@@ availability of the oral bio@@ availability ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is temporarily distributed according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily in sof@@ tie @-@ particles , but then rapidly disp@@ ers@@ ed into the bones or cre@@ ted with the urine .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is given adult patients to whom a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted in order to prevent the transplan@@ t of transplan@@ t through the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company submitted the results of the study conducted by Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transplan@@ tation where the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ ar por@@ in .
main Indi@@ cator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was delayed after a period of treatment of a year ( example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis required ) .
in addition , shorter studies of 119 patients were performed with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .
Tre@@ ign@@ y , heada@@ che , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood glucose level ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) as well as ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) .
in patients with et@@ ric sensitivity ( aller@@ gy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , Mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components should not be used .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs can be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication may be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated yellow @-@ orange gels printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule with &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immune system and treatment of transplan@@ ts should be attributed to this medicine or make changes in the immune system .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposition of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including lower or su@@ peri@@ ority .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the appropriate daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tight control of one in the corne@@ al transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposition of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Adv@@ agra@@ f dosage should be based on the clinical evaluation of deriv@@ ative and toler@@ ability in the case and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations )
after upgra@@ ding from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel should be controlled over two weeks before conversion and over two weeks .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposition was measured as valley mirror , with both formulation as well as with kidney transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
because T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f file schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the condition of the patient is not permitted in the first postoperative phase of oral medication , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of a infusion solution ) is initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application for the supp@@ ression of the gra@@ fts need to be maintained and the immune application must not be specified . consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations for transplan@@ t transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation Pre@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
additional dose adjustments may later be necessary , because the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of patients can be changing after the transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft therapy The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dos@@ siers recommended - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f . this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ o@@ si@@ va on C@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t will begin .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed to C@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t receivers though there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f at lun@@ ch@@ as@@ - and dar@@ ed transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ w@@ aged patients at a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with col@@ later@@ alized transplan@@ ts at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintaining blood skills in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver problems .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function as the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ases potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum incre@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ spiegel , calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ) and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume is recommended .
change@@ over of Cic@@ ar por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f at the change@@ over of a Cic@@ ar por@@ ter on a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is not offered ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ mud mirror in full bl@@ ut The dose should be based on clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in the case of in@@ fertil@@ isation of full @-@ blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley level controls .
it is recommended frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after upgra@@ ding from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustments , changes in immune @-@ intensive therapy or at the same use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood concentrate ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is an drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ am@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mud mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range from 5 to 20 ng / ml and in hing@@ es - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t changes or other side effects , which can occur in a row of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Unter@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the appropriate daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tight control of one in the corne@@ al transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ fts , which has been proved by other Immun@@ og@@ ha@@ va as a therap@@ ist , no clinical data for the rescue formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f are still present .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t transplan@@ t at adult &apos;s transplan@@ t help and transplan@@ t changes in childhood there are yet no clinical data for the rescue formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interaction that can lead to a reduction of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level in blood and to a atten@@ u@@ ation of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) is contained , or other vegetable consumption during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood , as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y was described as a carto@@ onist , or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ ic to observe , which can therefore occur under the agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ rup@@ tions are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ci@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid loads and oil .
like with other Immun@@ og@@ res@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection factor with a high protection factor .
if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us symptoms , symptoms such as heada@@ ches , change consciousness and visual imp@@ air@@ ment should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ ert , A@@ act@@ ose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary type act@@ ose tolerance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ m@@ act@@ ose .
the simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable medic@@ ations are known as inhibit@@ or or induction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood pressure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose towards maintaining equivalent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction with anti @-@ boy@@ cot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , flight con@@ du@@ b@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ os@@ ol as well as with the M@@ acro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ esters ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal contamination , resulting from the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal metabolism .
highly efficient pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute dis@@ abling actions , can increase or decrease the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .

as T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a , in order to increase the hormone exposure , is especially careful in decisions of the contra@@ c@@ ous measures .
the results of animal experim@@ entation have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ral and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a low number of investigations into gra@@ fts of transplan@@ ts do not provide evidence that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other Immun@@ og@@ ha@@ va an increased risk for adverse events in terms of course and the result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to potential harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ fo@@ e of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the epi@@ thel@@ ial profile of immun@@ o@@ si@@ va is often found because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
following their frequency , adverse events are listed below : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≤ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on basis of available data ) .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high level of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma cutting can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sing .
mode of action and pharmac@@ ological effects on the molecular layer should be conve@@ yed to the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the contact of the connection of the cell@@ ul@@ ers .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal production in the T cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain set of Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin g@@ enen .

L@@ ung@@ o transplan@@ tation In a interim analysis over a recent study conducted , multi @-@ central trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported about 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ ar por@@ in .
in the first year after the transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ tation , a chronic transplan@@ t syndrome , was often observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in Cic@@ ar por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in cases of patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it came in 2@@ 1.7 % of cases related to bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where Cic@@ ar was converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on Cic@@ ar ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute corne@@ al transplan@@ t was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) of the l@@ acro@@ lim@@ us group exceeds ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart Disease F@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was significantly lower than the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .

the initial initi@@ al@@ dose ( by minutes ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently transferred to the targeted valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml .
gut transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ co@@ sive study of cancer transplan@@ tations showed 155 patients ( 65 only int@@ m , 75 liver and Dar@@ m and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one showed a survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the testing of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and C@@ MV infections , bone mark@@ edly , lower initial doses of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , lead to Tal@@ ers from 10 to 15 ng / ml and nowadays as far as transplan@@ tation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ rite value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or are responsible for treatment of met@@ abolic ster@@ oids in relation to the higher Clear@@ ance rat .
this makes it possible that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , whereby the distinction is mainly performed via the g@@ all .
in a stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposition of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was almost 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital ble@@ aching ) .
the dosage and frequency of application are to be addressed to whether Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding in surgical procedure .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ deficiency , which causes blood @-@ related problems such as blood vessels in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa will not extract from ordinary plasma , but according to a method described as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell which was introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different medicines approved by the European Union called recur@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the medication of the medicine was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the pre@@ valence of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood cells was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ance ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , heada@@ che , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval from the European Commission of Ba@@ x@@ ter AG , issued an approval for Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage intake and duration of the sub@@ sidy therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of a factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the place and the degree of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
at the following domestic events , the factor VIII activity will not drop under the specified plasma bricks ( in % of the norm or in i.e. i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until the pain and the acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is past .
during the treatment course it is enriched to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma tiles .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different se@@ wer@@ age times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis In patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected value of VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ activities are not achieved or if ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary , if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective such that other therapeutic measures need to be determined .
the average speed is to be applied after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immigrants in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing the inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of the exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk of the risk of genetic and other factors depends on the largest and genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 wells and an@@ am@@ stically @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after upgra@@ ding from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re @-@ appear ( lowest ) In@@ hibit@@ ors .
due to the rare re@@ iter@@ ation of H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A in women over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still no experiences before .
the A@@ DR@@ s inhibit@@ ors were enrolled against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were treated with previously un@@ treated patients who have increased risk of inhibit@@ ors , heada@@ ches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on basis of available data is not in@@ valuable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decrease of blood @-@ sp@@ inning factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els came to surgery ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E In@@ fusion .
the ble@@ eding within the whole period was exciting and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diag@@ nose heavier hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to a factor of 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low In@@ hibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was no one of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diag@@ nose severe to moderate h@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrate ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII In@@ hibit@@ or .
patients non @-@ treated patients were treated with retinal clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on tracks of contamination prot@@ esters was analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies of antibodies against this proteins , lab parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , otherwise no indication of any signs or symptoms were referred to in an allergic reaction or sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ ti@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ople in several repeated product positions within the framework of the study .

based on the initial author@@ ization data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be considered a positive rating , but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of safety filter from A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the marketing activity may apply for further extensions in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee of Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will take his application upon approval for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , the brain , or the sof@@ ten parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) it is affected .
this is a type of virus , gen@@ etically modified so that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body .
when the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; which was so altered , that there is no copies of itself , and thus no infections can trigger in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been injected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of non @-@ defective in the human body @-@ p@@ 53 gene , is normally made to restore deleted DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share themselves .
the company recorded data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , in the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP has tested the answers to the questions that had already been checked , some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the test of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP covers a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has been advantages for the patient .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of appo@@ intments and the security of the medication .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ance can be established in reliable mode and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful to the patient .
the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP , whether the Imp@@ act consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ o Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; the drug release means that the tablets have so assembled so that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly will be released slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( Heu@@ ck@@ le , caused by an aller@@ gy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ( blocked nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the major contribut@@ ors were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ le n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome , which were reported from the patient before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients presented their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering the post@@ ing of all the Heu@@ le n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome , the patients reported a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % of patients suffering from the P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dron alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common adverse events of the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ o , psych@@ osis ( appet@@ ite disease ) , an@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , heada@@ ches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( stro@@ kes ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( stro@@ kes ) , sleep problems and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ k or one of the other components , against ad@@ missible ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( other medicines for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) , are not applied .
A@@ im@@ a@@ ze should also not be applied in patients who suffer from a risk factor ( high blood pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ th@@ och@@ re ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( over@@ l@@ ation of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a hem@@ isp@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge surgery ) or have a risk for a hem@@ at@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in whole to swal@@ low it ( i.e. without it to break , to break or to ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data to in@@ fertil@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long as long @-@ term application can take off the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ w in time .
after the decrease of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be continued as mon@@ otherap@@ y@@ sis .
since A@@ si@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ k contains , the drug is also contam@@ inated in patients who will be treated with a mono@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors like Bro@@ mo@@ ckery , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ er@@ go@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ er@@ go@@ amine , c@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ er@@ go@@ amine , phen@@ ols or nas@@ al phr@@ ases ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , ep@@ he@@ ers , Ox@@ y@@ er@@ az@@ za , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy have not been checked for this patient &apos;s disease and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
the patients must be informed about that treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a t@@ ach@@ ometer , cardi@@ ovascular problems , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or ampli@@ fication of heada@@ ches ) .

at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ologic tests , an anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic tests can otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent .
in the context of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
there were no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those treated with placebo , ir@@ respective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the met@@ abolic disorders of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not have , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies but no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and should not be used on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ oral properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ w should not be used in the pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to interference or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a standard depression ( sedi@@ ment , Ap@@ no@@ e , low spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ aesth@@ esia ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ads , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially important for children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ ga@@ ze , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ ic acid as well as the expression of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg , no increased frequency of stro@@ king in comparison to placebo was determined .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ w in the recommended dosage may request a further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the total amount for symptoms of symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ffs ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ ist in the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effects , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ffs , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ ial with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic state groups .
within a single dose study of pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ within 30 minutes is det@@ ectable within the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the floating weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ k was achieved in day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic surplus study , which was performed using the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , the four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in po@@ or@@ ly modified .

for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or w .
A@@ eri@@ us was tested in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials for seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the change of symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ les , number and size of quad@@ rup@@ eds , ins@@ ist of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
other studies have been presented to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tab@@ let@@ ins have been recycled as the tablets and use of children un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
for aller@@ g@@ inal Rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies of urine , the acceptance of symptoms came after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval by SP Europe to grant approval from A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ zu@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current level of disease and may be stopped after the symptoms of symptoms and resum@@ ed in their return .
during persistent rhin@@ itis ( the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during aller@@ gy periods .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in the clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , at the same time taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , alcohol has not increased the effective effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to interference or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , 3 % more adverse reactions were reported in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that was more common than when compared to placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ che ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event of heada@@ ches was treated with 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and at 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple @-@ dose study , which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ ids / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ ic as well as the expression of the expression of the P @-@ selection of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of clinical study with multiple doses , given in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was given no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effect .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ sier study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the case of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ les of nose , ju@@ ck@@ les , tr@@ ench and co@@ aching of the eyes and it@@ chy on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into dependence between the duration of the symptoms and also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ tin@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as is shown on the overall size of cargo to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ St@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine was investigated , as the underlying path@@ ophy@@ si@@ ology was investigated , because the underlying path@@ ology was similar to the alle@@ g@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the history of contamination with all ur@@ inary diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ anium is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , A@@ eri@@ us became effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the position of quad@@ rup@@ eds at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , the minority was the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic studies .
improvement in the ju@@ ck@@ les by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to the evaluation of these variables .
in an pharmaceutical in@@ gen@@ etics study , which were comparable to patients with general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved at 4 % of patients .
there are no occasion for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ vivo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( low @-@ fat , cal@@ ory breakfast ) is not available to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical trials carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of the tox@@ icity of deser@@ ts by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reprodu@@ ci@@ zing elast@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be seen in no special haz@@ ards for men .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ zu@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescribed physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections , anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies ought to play a role in diagnosis , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 ab@@ oli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and find out a higher sub@@ sidy load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of as@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup with children between 2 and 11 years , fully met@@ abolic , is identical to that of children who are met@@ abolic .

in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , at the same time taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , alcohol has not increased the effective effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total hardness of adverse events at children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup @-@ group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse reactions when patients were treated with placebo .
in a multiple @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who arrived for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily disaster dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ism and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , can be extra@@ pol@@ ated the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults to the children &apos;s population extra@@ pol@@ ated .
in the framework of clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .

in adult and young patients with aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective for the symptoms of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion , and ju@@ ck@@ les of nose , ju@@ ck@@ les , pal@@ sy , and co@@ aching of eyes and ju@@ ck@@ les on the pal@@ ate .
as is shown on the overall size of cargo to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ St@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively effectively transp@@ osed the allergic rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , A@@ eri@@ us became effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the position of quad@@ rup@@ eds at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully met@@ abolic phen@@ olic was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ des ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , fully met@@ abolic .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6 to 6 hours about 6 times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a half @-@ time period of approximately 120 hours .
there are no occasion for a clinical @-@ relevant active ingre@@ dient once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different individual daily dose studies showed that AU@@ D and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ Sir@@ up in a dose of 5 mg .

effectiveness and imm@@ unity of as@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets at the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the total hardness of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was immediately and did not turn significantly from the safety profile in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet @-@ tablet than bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to the trans@@ forming formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
within the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically grown .
during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard - measurement values of the curse , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity or tasks that are connected to the flies .
the spread of this bad met@@ abolic syndrome were comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients aged between 2 and 11 ( 6 % , children 16 % ) , and the safety profile of these patients , however , was not devi@@ ating from the general population .
in a single dose crossover crossover of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion were the formulation of bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , however , in connection with the dose studies of children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data for as@@ eri@@ us melting tab@@ let@@ ins have the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

a A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting tablet once daily put into the mouth for ruler of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ zu@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg used melting tablet than bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to the trans@@ forming formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
in the framework of clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
with an adult dose of 30 mg , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard - measurement values of the curse , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with aller@@ gen@@ ic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective for the symptoms of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion , and ju@@ ck@@ les of nose , ju@@ ck@@ les , pal@@ sy , and co@@ aching of the eyes and ju@@ ck@@ les on the pal@@ ate .
at a single dose crossover crossover of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion were the formulation of bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of the pre@@ clinical and clinical study tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in children between 2 and 11 years , fully met@@ abolic , is identical to that of children who are met@@ abolic .
this medication contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a Fru@@ ct@@ os@@ e- tolerance , glucose @-@ type absorption or a suc@@ rose @-@ ins@@ om@@ ase in@@ suff@@ ic@@ ation of this medicine is not given .
the total hardness of adverse events with children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group similar to the placebo group .
infants ( 2,3 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) were reported in infants of infants and infants ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution were observed in one single dose and have observed no side effects in patients at the age between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable to the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials suggested at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of stro@@ king in comparison to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be used depending on the duration of the symptoms and also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and
as based on the total length of cargo to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ St@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the load caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the spread of this fully met@@ abolic phen@@ olic was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ des ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution gives the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , it was no bio@@ equi@@ valence study , and it is expected that they are equal to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in different individual dose studies , the AU@@ D and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was comparable to the recommended doses compared to adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ Sir@@ up in a dose of 5 mg .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of influ@@ enza virus which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ de@@ mic breaks off when a new tribe of influ@@ enza virus is absorbed , which can easily spread to human beings because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) .
after the end of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; physical seed &quot; and is antibody against it .
this is the result of the immune system to form a contact with influ@@ enza virus .
subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a physical sense ) , are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
in this way , the scope of clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the provisions of the EMEA for pre@@ hen@@ ish vaccine .
should you take part in a clinical study and require more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules as a solution is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of these combination has not been examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should then be classified , if the doctor has checked , which has previously taken anti@@ viral medicines of the patient before , and the probability is that the virus is an@@ gled to the drugs .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children from four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase according to body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase decreases with in@@ gest@@ ion in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to heal the disease , however , the cran@@ ks of the immune system and so also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without ne@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had not been treated with protest .
the A@@ gen@@ ase medicines with low @-@ based R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , compared with other prot@@ esters .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us last ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ last according to the treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously taken no protest @-@ inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in the case of children , A@@ gen@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ us@@ last , but of the children who had been treated with Prot@@ ected bodies , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ esters , the drug A@@ gen@@ ase increased the vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other proteins as well :
in patients with HIV that was resistant against four other prot@@ esters , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger refuse of the viral load of Vir@@ us@@ last for four weeks than in patients receiving their previous proteins .
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are heada@@ ches , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ vin@@ ity ) , N@@ au@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and barrels ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is we@@ eds ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are the same as A@@ gen@@ ase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , in patients who take A@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the allocation of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ zeb@@ ox ( symptoms of a bone tissue ) or an immun@@ ological activation ( symptoms of infection which are caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in application in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a Prot@@ ected inhibit@@ or is not detected .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; unusual circumstances , &quot; because of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited issued a approval for the launch of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years of age .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should usually be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ avi@@ r by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of ra@@ is@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be performed under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore as@@ or@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable to form a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily , together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the stronger addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ kings ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral treatments up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ampl@@ itude which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of as@@ os@@ ase in combination with low doses of rats or other prot@@ esters have not been investigated in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to in@@ compatibility and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily , and in patients with severe liver problems to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should occur in patients with mild or dis@@ rup@@ ted liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder in patients ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates des Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ acy ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they can also develop opportun@@ ist infections , or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment of A@@ gen@@ ase did not prevent the risk of transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated in chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have an increased risk of serious liver failure with potentially fatal dose .
in case of case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this drugs .
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including a chronic active hepatitis , showed an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ c@@ ason or other Glu@@ co@@ qu@@ o@@ idal metast@@ asis is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment in the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ oid arthritis , including mor@@ dial infar@@ ction and supp@@ ression of the epi@@ thel@@ ial function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the prevention of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous appointment of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ it@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ev@@ al , phen@@ ic@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards ratios ) , are available methods for determining the concentration concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma tiles ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a may be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ at@@ ric symptoms , in particular if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity after the high prop@@ yl@@ ating content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is made with children under an age of four years and should be applied with cau@@ tion at certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ esters , has been reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , or an ex@@ az@@ ure of existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy , which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B . higher age , and with pharmaceutical - dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
at ug@@ ing@@ op@@ hil@@ ic patients ( type A and B ) , reports were treated with prot@@ on@@ ists , reports on an increase of blood vessels including a spont@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflamm@@ atory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ functional etching is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ ci@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ o@@ intments , higher body @-@ mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines that are mainly used primarily via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and to increased plasma tiles with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma bricks by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed .
cur@@ acy ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) The ser@@ en@@ spiegel from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be matched by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ acy ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) .
if a patient already takes by Johann@@ is , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ est mirror and , if possible , add the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ vy .
a dose adaptation for any of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which indicate the effectiveness and imm@@ unity of this treatment schem@@ es .
52 % lower if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to use a tight monitoring , as the effectiveness and imm@@ unity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study to use A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ a@@ dem component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , for a gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer and existing limited data can be susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , cau@@ tion , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or sub@@ therapeutic plasma bricks .
when these medicines are applied together , cau@@ tion ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring will be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ control ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ control ut@@ in by 193 % , thereby resulting in an increase in the associated side effects .
if clinical reasons is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ control ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is necessary , at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies in combination with ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma tiles of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneously appo@@ intments .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg of fossils , and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily led to an increase in C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily with a value of 2.@@ 69@@ mm compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without con@@ current use of fossils with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or , induction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , may lead to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions , which are monitored by these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ an , Phen@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction in plasma tiles of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ig@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , hair@@ pin pin , cro@@ codi@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ b pin , N@@ ite pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase activity and tox@@ icity of this drugs .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ li@@ ma , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluid cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma is significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous C@@ ort@@ is@@ ol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment in the risk of system@@ ic con@@ cor@@ oid arthritis ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose failure is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to be expected to expect A@@ gen@@ ase .
because plasma pressure increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including one R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ization of the mirrors is recommended since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by the same gift ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral @-@ adopted mi@@ dd@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is commanded by A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ections indicate an possible increase in plasma tiles of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3- up to 4 times .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ at@@ ric symptoms , in particular if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of its low reliability of historical clubs , no recommendation can be given , like the am@@ on@@ avi@@ or dose when am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
for the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards ratios ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional appointment of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore an alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Northern tr@@ yp@@ ical ) is recommended for the same gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful weak@@ ening of the possible uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been demonstrated , however , it is not known if am@@ on@@ avi@@ r passes away in breast milk .
a reproduction study on dre@@ aming rats , which was administered by the penet@@ rate in the uter@@ us up to the end of the nurs@@ ing time Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight .
the further development of descendants including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ acted by the appointment of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the imp@@ ur@@ ity of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and with children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were easy to uni@@ form@@ ly expressed , came early on and led rarely to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time for the HIV treatment of applied medicines , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the mentioned side effects come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients do not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) were evaluated by the test doctors in connection with the study medi@@ ation and were listed below 1 % of the patients as well below the treatment of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) , including a loss of peripher@@ y and covered fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ ic of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ cal fat content ( stem ) .
with 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated people who had been treated with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( pins ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ME was treated with 245 patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin @-@ set@@ backs are usually easily identified , ery@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ cul@@ ous nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ les , as a rule , during the second treatment of treatment , and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without having to be demolished with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ zeb@@ ra cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the cases of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ation effect , an anti @-@ inflamm@@ ation therapy ( ART ) can develop a anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily together with low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception to increases the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ sized R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary actions are required .
Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the pro@@ c@@ essi@@ an viral disease and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins , not infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ bic bacteria lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ors ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 μ@@ m in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication of people is not defined yet .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved fossils / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ es - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
in the case of sixteen from 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of fossils with 100@@ mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ arith@@ met@@ ic could be examined until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ical could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 included , showed resistance patterns that were similar to adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) were treated with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ arith@@ met@@ ic patients over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer mut@@ ations on :
according to gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used to assess the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer @-@ resistant insulation .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I / V / S / EC , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance to fossils with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logy ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ ists are subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
according to phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , clin@@ ically valid@@ ated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer @-@ resistant insulation .
companies to distribute diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically developing clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to evaluate results of resistance tests .
each of these four , with a reduced sensitivity against am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and associated genetic patterns , a certain Crus@@ aders against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity of in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ esters for all 4 fossil fuels , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , bab@@ o@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other protest @-@ resistant insul@@ ators ; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the insulation .
the early demol@@ ition of a different treatment is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on PRO@@ F@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to as@@ os@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ per@@ ple@@ xity of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last period ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ lining wave of 0,4 @-@ 10 copies / ml .
it is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gen@@ ase solution was given in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
the majority of patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients had been given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the patients with A@@ gen@@ ase administered together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml when the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered as expected for treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children of un@@ le@@ ath@@ ing &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
the average duration ( max. ) up to maximum serum concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for each capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the appointment of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the magn@@ itude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed on a large distribution volume , as well as a un@@ hin@@ dered pend@@ ulum by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of free active components during the dosing intervals of C@@ max , ss , up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that are induc@@ ing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be delivered with cau@@ tion if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure , such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ds than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable to a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al impact on the elimination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatments schem@@ es lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma pressure similar to those who are generated from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous appointment of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on mice with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats joined forces with male animals or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the part@@ iti@@ ves Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for the human being is un@@ clear .
this report on the people , both clinical trials and the therapeutic use , however , showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core test on rats and chromosome test , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r was neither presum@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
up to date , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the appointment of A@@ gen@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies of tox@@ icity in young people who were treated with an age of 4 days showed , both in the control and with the Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated animals showed a high mortality .
in an system@@ ic plasma exposition which was significantly less than ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of minor changes , including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ on@@ ally and slight sk@@ el@@ etal changes , which point to a delayed development .
24 When A@@ war@@ ase capsules are applied without the stronger addition of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ kings ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral treatments up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ampl@@ itude which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should occur in patients with weak or lighter liver disorder with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver disorder in patients ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ev@@ al , phen@@ ic@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards ratios ) , are available methods for determining the concentration concentration .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with pharmaceutical - dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to use a tight monitoring , as the effectiveness and imm@@ unity of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
when these medicines are applied together , cau@@ tion ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring will be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ control ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is necessary , at least half of the recommended dose may be 31 , although no clinical data are available .

in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluid cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma is significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous C@@ ort@@ is@@ ol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
for the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards ratios ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous appointment of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
this medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful weak@@ ening of the possible uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study on dre@@ aming rats , which was given by the penet@@ rate in the uter@@ us up to the end of the nurs@@ ing time Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the stand@@ still time .
the imp@@ ur@@ ity of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and with children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary actions are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ bic bacteria lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ors ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 μ@@ m in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other protest @-@ resistant insul@@ ators ; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the insulation .
based on these data , treatment optimization should be considered to be considered as expected for the expected value of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase with PI pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of free active components during the dosing intervals of C@@ max , ss , up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that are induc@@ ing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be delivered with cau@@ tion if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al impact on the elimination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .

the application of application and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dara is spread three times a week in the genital area . • In case of small bas@@ al cell cancer , the cream is spread over six weeks twice a week , with four weeks break between treatment cycles , three times a week .
cream spreads in front of the sleeping corner to the affected skin surfaces , so that it remains sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with placebo ( same cream but without the active ingre@@ dient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested for 16 weeks in four main studies in the genital area 16 weeks .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete healing tissue . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , in which patients treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dara or placebo was either treated daily or five times a week .
main Indi@@ cator for the efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ors according to twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies at a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ula .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • In case of treatment of arms in genital cardi@@ ac patients , the results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dara ( observed more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or ju@@ ck@@ les ) .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long for@@ aging , until all the visible barrels are disappeared in the genital or peri@@ o@@ zone region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment should be calculated if intensive local inflamm@@ atory actions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the mean follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been left , the patient apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy schedule .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream spreads out in thin coating and rub in a thin layer of rub , rub until the cream is completely shut down .
it should be necessary to reduce the risk of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible swelling of their auto@@ immune disease .
the risk of treatment should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with an event@@ ual organ shock or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ auth@@ ausen were carried out , two cases of severe P@@ lei@@ osis and one case were observed with one of the circumcision by the circumcision .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation have been observed , which have a treatment necessary and / or have led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women have difficulty in the water , which had an emergency cath@@ eter and a treatment of the affected area necessary .
for application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , directly in connection to a treatment with other cut@@ out means for the treatment of external tra@@ ine@@ apples in the genital and periodi@@ c range yet there are no clinical experience .
limited data suggest an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ pes reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the shar@@ k principle was not examined .
local skin reactions are often , but the intensity of these reactions are generally taken during therapy , or the reactions form themselves after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
when it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment period can be made by several days .
the clinical results of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generation of treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
currently no data on long term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma should be drawn into consideration with other appropriate therapy forms .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are no clinical experience , so the use of already pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study point out that at large Tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) , a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists of .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or at the lift area within the pitch range .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ i@@ ants at anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in the under@@ poor and hands will not support the effectiveness in this case for use , hence a der@@ ision application is not recommended .
local skin actions often occur , but these reactions normally take time during therapy to intensity , or after putting together the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if local skin actions cause big dis@@ comfort , or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ les@@ ions have a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with cau@@ tion of patients who receive a immune motion ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , the integration or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

according to test results of the clinical signs , this clinical signs showed that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often too heavy ery@@ thema mig@@ rate ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and serious mud formation and o@@ rest@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was found Alo@@ pe@@ zie with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the position of treatment or in the surrounding area .
the unusual one @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , heada@@ ches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects that occurred after several or@@ oral doses of &gt; 200 mg occurred in h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony that normal@@ ized on oral or intraven@@ ous containers .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ o@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines were detected .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies have been shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete cur@@ ing of the tra@@ cker at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior for 16 weeks of placebo .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the patients suffering from placebo treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) .
a complete healing process could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five @-@ time application for 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target range had been hist@@ ologically with individual primary super@@ vis@@ iti@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this also remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ c les@@ ions within a combined 25 cm2 of large treatment rooms than on the un@@ hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the year @-@ old data from two combined monitoring studies show patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of extern@@ ally , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ cial cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dara cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies involving children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic recording of 5 % in@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applying in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half times was about 10 times higher than the second half @-@ time period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; that shows an extended retention of medicine in the skin .
the data regarding the system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od showed low application of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 and comparable to healthy adult and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ vis@@ aged bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of tox@@ icity in the rat @-@ rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg was significantly reduced to significantly reduced weight and elevated Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months , resulting in the mouse there is no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at the time of three days per week induc@@ ted no tum@@ ors at the scope of the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ ually due , is a risk of human exposure as very small .
the tum@@ ors represented in the group of mice that has been treated with the real time cream , earlier and in larger number , as in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can hurt other people as well as these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the effects listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ acted or you notice any side effects that are not given in this instruction leaf@@ let , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied for the enzy@@ mes of patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ fication ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ co@@ ach@@ og@@ l@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) will not be dismant@@ led and therefore in most organs in the body and fo@@ aming .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of MP@@ S I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , mot@@ ile , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the appointment of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or a hospital with re @-@ recovery devices , and the patients require adequate medicines in order to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured as well as its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine of approximately 60 % , and half of the children treated had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ ches , nau@@ seas , abdom@@ inal pain , pain @-@ pain ( joint pain ) , pain pain , pain in limb@@ s , pain , fever and reactions at the infusion point .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sha@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ ct@@ ic reaction ) , not applied .
the European Medi@@ c@@ eption Agency ( EMEA ) will be able to test all new information which may be well @-@ known , and that the summary is required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received patients who observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as regards the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued an approval to the G@@ enzyme Europe Company B.@@ V. issued a approval for the per@@ verse of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the hum@@ ane α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ ical cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ uter , E@@ ier@@ z of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ time enzy@@ mes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ fication I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial infusion rate can be increased from 2 E / kg / h if the patient has to be increased every 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fu@@ elling reactions , which are defined as any adverse effect as any related effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the In@@ fu@@ sion Day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored constantly , and the infusion of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in which revi@@ ve facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibody or symptoms of in@@ fu@@ cking response must be treated with cau@@ tion by al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me using cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as a little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , risk pro@@ vision@@ ing must be careful due to theo@@ reti@@ cally increased risk @-@ reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ y and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence process @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ related response , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be used and / or a reduction in the increase in response rate to half of the response rate .
in case of a single , heavy duty @-@ related reaction , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to a decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ y and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
the infusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists of .
experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ elled against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , is recommended , not to feed during the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were classified predominantly in clinical trials , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse reactions related to Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often performed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history , there was severe reactions like bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and fac@@ ial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable medicines effects in connection with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a phase of phase 2 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe loss form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , there occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it usually occurred in the patients at the age of 5 , compared to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radio@@ active op@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say det@@ ectable antibody , among them 3 patients who never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with a lack of a low @-@ antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the day mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to indicate a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal effect to the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies could not be found in connection with the incidence of adverse pharmaceutical activities , even if the occurrence of adverse reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accum@@ ul@@ ative sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accum@@ ulation of en@@ cum@@ ulation .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed from the cycle and recorded by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely to be the most likely than man @-@ 6 phosph@@ orus .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recruited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was raised from the median of phen@@ otype and only one patient rejected the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ tion@@ ated volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute enclosure in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the content that is represented in the following table .
in the open extension study , there was an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the anticipated pro@@ cent@@ u@@ als FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical and absolute lung capacity increased significantly to the height of growing children .
out of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ oma ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel was detected in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , who remained constant up to the study .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous path@@ ation between the patients suffering from a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant change in a 6 @-@ minute test has been summar@@ ised ( compared to expected percentage of patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical in@@ gen@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients , at the time of its inclusion in the study below 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy processing form and 4 with the medium @-@ running form ) .
in four patients the dosage for increased GA@@ G@@ - mirrors have been increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was diagnosed with the mean age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ running form shows a normal mental develop@@ mental rate , whereas in the older patients were limited limited or even a progress in cogn@@ itive performance .
in a phase 4 study investigation , a dynamic effects of various Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me fe@@ eder schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute salary test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a represented alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inspec@@ tions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent to the same .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar , like that in older and fewer patients affected .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ sh@@ ology , tox@@ icity at one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift and reprodu@@ ci@@ zing elast@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data will not recognize any special haz@@ ards for men .
since there were no imp@@ air@@ ment studies , this medication may not be mixed with other medicines except for the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .

the European Medi@@ c@@ eption Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not kept longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the di@@ lution in controlled and valid@@ ated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions took place .
preparation of the Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me In@@ fusion ( by as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e according to body weight of the single patient must first determine the number of rub@@ bing cylinders .
A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ plat@@ in ( any other medicines that could not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( such as an operation alone can not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( such as an operation alone can be removed ) and probably spread themselves slightly to other parts of the body . • more advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ sense &quot; lung cancer , which affects not the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who were previously not treated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used to have other chem@@ otherap@@ ists , used as a couple of therapy .
to decrease side effects , patients should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and folic acid of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition , or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent the fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s thus the formation of DNA and RNA , preventing the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re in its active shape is easier to out@@ fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the medication by means of longer effic@@ ien@@ cies in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy .
in the treatment of non @-@ binding lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study found 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had been treated with chemotherapy , compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy in lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy alone was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients , in which cancer cells were not the record @-@ epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the appointment of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medical care .
in September 2004 , the European Commission told the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. issued a approval for the traffic on A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , except with vast plate epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after graduation of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - infusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ binding bronze car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days of treatment .
the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ gift as well as the day after the treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ oid .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re must be taken for at least 5 doses and intake must be continued during the whole period of therapy as well as for a further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to maintain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ dose as well as after each third reference action .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re should be created before each gift a complete blood pattern is created , including the differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose should be held under Ber@@ ri@@ y@@ - and the N@@ adi@@ c of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity of the previous treatment cycles .
according to the recovery , the patients need to be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherap@@ or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C @-@ 2 ble@@ eding .
patients non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity could develop ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be interrupted by the patient in front of the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients with 2 dos@@ siers and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ aking at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies did not give notice that in the age of 65 years of age or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 an elevated @-@ scale an@@ thro@@ es exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to in@@ compatibility and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , there are no dose adjustments required for all of the dose recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or Trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( for the occurrence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( with presence of liver metast@@ ases ) did not apply especially in studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of the Kno@@ wing market , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ bo@@ - cycles once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for other cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ ron number , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ancy and maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity , such as it were observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ug@@ ly mat@@ ologic tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , feb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed , if a previous treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treated patients must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic treatment to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be treated according to I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ i@@ - c@@ yl@@ actic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ ating ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have been used for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ f will need to avoid intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long @-@ time period for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection , a drainage collection in the trans@@ cellular space will be a drainage of the effect before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treatment .
5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including my@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , and shred@@ ding events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re occasionally , if the active ingre@@ dient was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application is not recommended ( except yel@@ or@@ fever , these vaccine is contra@@ cted ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ks@@ ation of re@@ productive capacity , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - G@@ tin should be advised to obtain advice in respect to the sperm .
patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) may lead high doses non@@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ actic acid in a high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ selection with the consequence of a increased impact of side effects .
therefore , be careful if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ actic acid in high doses are applied .

since there is no data regarding the potential potential of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long @-@ time period such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the con@@ current application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the Ger@@ inner status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ opla@@ stic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Standards ratios ) , when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are currently no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to fluctu@@ ations , but as with an@@ de@@ mic anti @-@ met@@ abolic defects are expected to be serious in pregnancy in the pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re must not be applied during pregnancy but if necessarily , and after careful weak@@ ening of the use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive of re@@ productive forces should be noted before the start of the treatment , men should be advised before the treatment of the lock @-@ service .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re is surviving in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects on the gest@@ ion infant cannot be excluded .

patients who use All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should turn on their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they cannot remove some fats in the food , thereby causing approximately a quarter of the fat related to the food un@@ digest@@ ible to the int@@ estine .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the all@@ i 60 mg used to list an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , a common weight loss could be observed in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
the most common adverse events of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are small spots at after , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) with chair feed , chair , fat / ö@@ sive chair , low @-@ term secre@@ tion . ( drums ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with Cic@@ ar ( for transplan@@ t transplan@@ t for transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients who are accepted to a long @-@ term painter absorption syndrome ( which do not have enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or with breast mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a Gla@@ xo Group Limited for approval from Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is suitable for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ crit@@ eri@@ ed diet .
all@@ i can not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there are not sufficient data regarding effectiveness and security .
since Or@@ list@@ at however is only minimal res@@ or@@ ating , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .

the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of securing gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or low @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes prior to onset of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etics must be adjusted .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adapted .
it is recommended to make additional fluctu@@ ations of fluctu@@ ate measures in order to prevent any of severe di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö potential failure of the oral contra@@ sts ( see section 4.5 ) .
in both a study on the effects of medicines as well as in several cases with the same use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ ar por@@ in was observed a reduction of the Cic@@ ar por@@ in plasma plasma .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values might be influenced ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years were treated with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ otene in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepar@@ es to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of volunteers , which received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a slight decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ia .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal nature and hang along with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of recorded fat is avoided .
the gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporarily .
the few things are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rarely ( frequency on basis of available data ) .
the frequency of those known side effects , which were detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntary by a population of un@@ certain size .
† Es is pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel , that the treatment with all@@ i to convert to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal side effects can lead .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings .
during the majority of reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ Sur@@ do@@ ation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigation on human and animal , it may be out of a fast back @-@ formation of any system@@ ic effects , which are attributed to the li@@ fe@@ eh@@ em@@ atic properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic efficacy is set in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small int@@ estine by kov@@ al@@ ente Bin@@ ding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ic .
in clinical trials , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fats are blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , plac@@ eb@@ ocular studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrated the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which has been taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ crit@@ eri@@ ed diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared with the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) has been rated as follows : as the change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies , weight reduction over 12 months has been observed , the greatest weight loss in the first 6 months was observed .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( such as Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ists who are a trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ et@@ ric ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not sufficient .
this means that the drug of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , preventing the recept@@ ors in the int@@ estine .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ists who are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ ysi@@ us , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ ysi@@ us , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 by 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ ysi@@ et@@ ron ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued an approval from Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. issued a approval for the on @-@ traffic of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in heavily damaged chemotherapy due to cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting on moderate chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting that is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding one before the m@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thick@@ n@@ age , patients should be monitored by an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ fication or signs of an sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or those that tend to be an extension .
except in connection with a further Chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift mag@@ i is supposed to be used in the days after the chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ treated the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a jet@@ ty concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ spir@@ i , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , do@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , ox@@ et@@ on@@ avi@@ r , C@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in , had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures are not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied to fluctu@@ ations , unless it is necessary to be considered to be treated by the doctor .
clinical trials were the most frequently observed effects of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive actions and reactions to the concert venue ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reviews .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar houses showed un@@ desirable events as in other dosing groups ; no dose @-@ effective relations were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume . however , a di@@ aly@@ sis may probably not have effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams , or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to Day 1 without D@@ ut@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with heavily em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials investig@@ ating chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameter , including the Q@@ T@@ c interval and the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ onic and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ onic channels and extend the duration of the potential potential .
the objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ M. , in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 , and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After an intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ cre@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tion@@ ately in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3 - 90 m g / kg .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations emerged that at a time of a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached a total of 0.75 mg measured by one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max is 0.75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % of the kidneys will be eliminated and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic ties , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved .
elimination of an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , as un@@ changeable effect , made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a unique intraven@@ ous bolt , the overall physical activity of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in the eyes of patients with severe liver disorder the terminal Eli@@ mination period and the average system@@ ic exposition with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is however non@@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 of pre@@ clinical trials showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose dischar@@ ged in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given every day over two years , led to a multiplied frequency of liver tum@@ ors ( in thy@@ ro@@ sis , hem@@ isp@@ ru@@ pe@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known but due to the used doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be smaller than for the human being .
the author@@ ization of this approval to the bank account will have to bring about the plans for placing the policy of the medicine in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative result in which the approval of the approval of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to an organic medicines called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same arz@@ az@@ i @-@ effective ingre@@ dient that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Det@@ er@@ ant &quot; ) .
alp@@ ac@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue has damage caused , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ y@@ amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast which was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) that stimul@@ ates the effect of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data in front of the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active component structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effective mode , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference value to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients were treated after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 32 E @-@ mail ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document . what were the greatest concerns that have caused the CH@@ MP recommendation to the recommendation for the account ?
in addition , concerns that the data on the stability of the active substance and the medication were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjustment of treatment with alp@@ habet , the disease occurs in more patients than with the reference phar@@ ma @-@ agent ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used in the study to investigate the question that is how long the medication forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) dis@@ solves , not sufficiently valid@@ ated .
it may be used to treat imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cruci@@ fy in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) , poor and gen@@ etically modified wounds are applied .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because the alarm against this kind of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient had not responded to the treatment after two to three days , the physician should examine and pull out alternative treatments to the treatment .
it acts with block@@ ade of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of the bacteria .
the main Indi@@ cator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection had failed by the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated in placebo .
during the treatment of infected skin results , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were combined with skin dogs , about 90 % of patients were treated in both groups on the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed that Al@@ tar@@ go on the treatment of abor@@ tions ( out@@ filled hollow spaces in the body tissue ) or from infections , which were proven or probably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common adverse event with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order of the order .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go on a short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections across the risks are : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small la@@ in@@ ations , poor or gen@@ om@@ itted wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval from the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . granted approval for the In@@ verse of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients , in which no improvements could occur within two to three days , should be considered once more and an alternative @-@ alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensiti@@ zation or severe local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment was canc@@ eled , the sal@@ ine is carefully sealed and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin shall not be applied for the treatment of infections , which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials , secondary wounds was the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant forkli@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvements or deteri@@ oration of infected places .
the impact of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma con@@ spir@@ als that were reached after the top@@ ical application on slo@@ ping skin or identified super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically important in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous use of 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments will not be held for necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ produce elast@@ icity after oral taking and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able by the use of a system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / ended , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be completed , between the benefit of the nurs@@ ing infant treatment and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most frequently reported adverse event of Ir@@ rit@@ ation on the booking site , which was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic D@@ eri@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of bacterial protein synthesis due to interaction on a specific binding point of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from binding other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding point of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 is involved and transferred in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ary centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ market centre .
by connecting to this binding point , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine block the pep@@ tide , block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent regular formation of active 50s @-@ bos@@ ses .
if the use of the local pre@@ valence of the resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may appear , a consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to the treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and placed on slo@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma map@@ le were obtained .
the sampling procedure took place in the days 3 or 4 in adult patients and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be applied to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ D ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxide in human liver micro@@ som@@ ed was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro verification in gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma test or into cultures of human @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes cells as well as in the rats test test for the in @-@ vivo study chromos@@ om@@ aler effects .
there were neither male fertil@@ ity for oral fertil@@ ity at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day so that one up to 5 times higher exposure has been achieved as the highest exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application at 200 cm2 ) :

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affects the liver ) in children between the ages of 15 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
am@@ bi@@ rix will be used within one of two doses existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation has a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and is ensured that the vaccination will be able to end up from two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose against hepatitis A or B is required , am@@ bi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or -@@ b vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines may affect the immune system ( the natural death of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
am@@ bi@@ rix contain the same components as the vacc@@ inated vaccine of Twin@@ rix Children since 1996 and the vaccine of Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same disease , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Children are administered within the framework of one out of three doses .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ rix , also used as cover for use of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Am@@ bi@@ rix carried out a month after the last injection between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated antibodies to hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was in a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections were similar .
the most common adverse events of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are heada@@ ches , pain on the injection of the injection , Roman , matter ( fatigue ) as well as maturity .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not be sensitive to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals S.@@ A. issued a approval for the return of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic mun@@ itions with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
in case of hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated for hepatitis B as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C surface anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) of anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same range as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vaccine .
it is not yet secured , whether immune @-@ competent people who have spoken to an hepatitis A@@ - vaccine will need to be a refresh@@ er than protection , as they may be protected by the immune memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ s@@ ctic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always be available immediately .
if a qu@@ icker protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended to combine the 360 ELISA units for the in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
with her@@ b@@ aly@@ sis and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are achieved , so in these cases the gift of another vaccine will be necessary .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ous administration can lead to an optimal impedance to be avoided , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
for Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood od@@ inn@@ ate disorders , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be injected , as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ation gift .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ th@@ rem , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ king M@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immune therapy or patients with immune effects , no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation of adults was the frequency of pain , Roman , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , heada@@ ches and fever similar with the incidence that observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ate and preser@@ v@@ atives vaccine was observed .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered by a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
only exceptions were the higher doses of pain and matter on a calculation basis per vacc@@ inated Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a 3 @-@ dose combination impedance .
according to the complete vaccination cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Am@@ bi@@ rix over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % with the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable to difference ( i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received Am@@ bi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects which received 3 @-@ doses of combination . ) .
the frequency of pre@@ emin@@ ent pain and matter was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccination , the appearance of local inter@@ actions and general actions in the Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ group is comparable to that with the 3 @-@ doses Com@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed .
however , between the 6- and 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Am@@ bi@@ rix a little bit of pain ( at the injection rate ) per dose , not reported per rate .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that have severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination @-@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen , was statistically significant differently .
in clinical trials that were performed in vaccination at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 , administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 , administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study conducted at 12@@ - up to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
for the 289 people , their imm@@ unity were evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ator rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 .
the immune response shown in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vaccination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination with Am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination @-@ impedance with 360 ELISA units ( in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for individuals who were at the time of basic mun@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that of 3 doses with a combination @-@ impedance , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was detected in a dose of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .
when the first dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time using a combined slide mechanism , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ th@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ ans ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ cul@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation of adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ation@@ - and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion rates such as the former formulation .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in the water contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark roots , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowed ) and other symptoms that may need to do a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect Am@@ bi@@ rix from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are already infected by hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus if you are already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although she / her child can &apos;t feel un@@ likely or ill , it may not prevent any vaccination .
a protection against other infections , which are causing liver refuse or symptoms which are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be conve@@ yed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any component of the vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can pers@@ ist through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin irrit@@ ation , respiratory or irrit@@ ating face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually the second vaccine dose ) .
for a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the physician will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of more effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine will be administered once a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination .
sometimes Am@@ bi@@ rix is injected under the skin and not injected under the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened by the skin and not into the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened by a condition or treatment in your body &apos;s own body , or if you are subject to a ham@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Make your doctor if you are taking for any further medicine or if you have been vacc@@ inated if you have been vacc@@ inated if your child has been vacc@@ inated or Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) was given or she is planned for the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough , and the person is not being protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time by Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limb@@ s .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women are not given , except it is ur@@ gently necessary to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , please talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the dates that have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the launch , the CH@@ MP has noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix has been positive .
since Am@@ bi@@ rix but only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medic@@ ations are limited to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium @-@ ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzy@@ mes or with hyper@@ combustion en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( Hir@@ n@@ bsp ) as a result of a high level of ammon@@ ium concentration .
the ammon@@ ium of ammon@@ ium is divided into several single doses to meals - swallowed or mixed with a gast@@ ro@@ ckets ( through the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket in the stomach of leading hose ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( by the nose in the stomach of the hose ) .
it was not a comparable study , since ammon@@ ite children could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ite children may also cause appet@@ ite loss , a ab@@ normal acid content in the blood , depression , heada@@ che , stimul@@ us , liquid pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , rash , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ ite the ammon@@ ium of ammon@@ ium , in patients with dist@@ urban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle .
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; unusual circumstances , &quot; because of the rarity of the illness at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with an all @-@ time enzy@@ mes already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a delayed form ( in@@ complete enzyme , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself according to the first life of life ) then consists of an indication for the use when in the am@@ ity of hyper@@ fla@@ vor@@ ous en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , children who are not able to swal@@ low as tablets or for patients with si@@ zing dysfunction , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated based on account of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manipul@@ ated lack of car@@ nit@@ yl@@ actic acid or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ fs , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cino synth@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with o@@ ck@@ et@@ dysfunction , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ g@@ us@@ ul@@ a consists of if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g of sodium yl@@ hex@@ ad@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium , and eyel@@ et formation can only be applied with cau@@ tion .
since metabolism and differentiation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ aca , young rats ate to a high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of crushed syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nervous damage in the brain and thus a disability in the brain death .
it could not be detected , whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ aca is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is generated during a stand@@ still time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS reached at least 56 % of patients at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not in connection with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ acid tin , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ ia , ar@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
one case of an over@@ dosage occurred with an acci@@ dental one dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) during a 5 month old small child .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ aca , which showed an intraven@@ ous rate of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ sh@@ ined ne@@ ural elast@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ abolic connection , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amin is seen comparable to phenol ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for removal of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dist@@ urban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for every gram of bias of phen@@ yl@@ lab@@ yr@@ ite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen , can be assumed for each gram .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival of survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early sl@@ ated form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ der@@ age was almost always infectious , and the disease caused by treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their stu@@ c@@ ages within the first year of life .
by her@@ b@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ite , sodium ben@@ zo@@ at , and perhaps subst@@ itution of essential amino acids , it was possible to raise the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and patients were treated with hyper@@ ast@@ er@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y before the first appearance of a hyper@@ sensitive en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y . the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients with many too mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logic deficit .
patients with a delayed form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ sensitive en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and followed permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet showed the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic deficit are hardly reversible with treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is well known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney and glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ anium used to an empty dose of 5 g of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at on an empty healthy adult and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual provisions and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to an intraven@@ ous gift by sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ aca .
after an oral single dose of 5 g of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ ted concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lei@@ c acid or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin gene , it was det@@ ectable in various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after pressing a phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ce@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations appear in the plasma brick on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
differentiation The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is taken as oral for infants ( infants and children , who can &apos;t swal@@ low no tablets or patients with si@@ ck@@ le problems ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ ckets or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manipul@@ ated lack of car@@ nit@@ yl@@ actic acid or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ fs , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g of sodium yl@@ hex@@ ad@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rap@@ atten@@ ed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ aca ( active met@@ abol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the stag @-@ house .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ acid tin , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ ia , ar@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for removal of excess joints .
on the basis of resear@@ ches of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dist@@ urban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle , it can be assumed for each gram of bias of phen@@ yl@@ lab@@ yr@@ ite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logic deficit are hardly reversible with treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
according to an oral single dose of 5 g of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ ted concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the great measuring sco@@ op of 8.6 g of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to get the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , that they cannot be able to put a waste in the body by consumption of proteins in the body .
if there are laboratory experiments performed , you need to inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ HP , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
for taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not a sp@@ elling medication .
during the stand@@ still time you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the drug may survive in breast milk and could harm your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ences , heada@@ ches , flav@@ ours disorders , reproduction of Geh@@ ör@@ s , Des@@ ti@@ bility , memory , and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ log@@ ically states were observed .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar ( a form of pain in breast grain ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a ab@@ normal measured value of the electro@@ retin@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to patients in patients that undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue to be continued for up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac disease in order to contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the sole offering or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) , compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - at the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart fail@@ ures or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except with severe ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other stags , or one of the other components .
furthermore , it may not be applied to patients who had a blood circulation , as well as with a strong high blood pressure or a severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human Use agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in at the treatment of ACS and one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd to provide a licence for placing the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dic@@ ation ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ lever ) ) with an emergency access or when early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI was conducted in other sequence one PCI , an additional bolts of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after clinical requirements , the reduced infusion dose can be taken up from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolts of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a single intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and efficacy of an all@@ u@@ ci@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , should be charged a second bol@@ dness of 0.3 mg / kg / kg body weight .
to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used with a lower accuracy rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose .
in patients with moderate kidney disease , which led to approval in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also on di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is inde@@ xed ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tioned le@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• A well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity against the active ingre@@ dient or the risk of blood cells or an elevated blood risk of blood cells . • heavy un@@ controlled hypertension . • heavy kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and on di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients have been carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blo@@ od@@ ation , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in case of PCI @-@ patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ dings occur in most ble@@ eding an arter@@ ial point , in patients who are subjected to a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle .
in patients who are treated waiting in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a surveillance of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards ratio ) should be drawn to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding in return is achieved prior to the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge about the impact mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant units ) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ valent in combination with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant aggre@@ gate or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ at@@ ric parameters are regularly to control regularly .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate for the impacts of the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see below Section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated women as well as in patients over 65 years are more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe hem@@ or@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measure for severe ble@@ eding as shown in Table 2 .

the following data on adverse events are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ations in 6000 patients receiving one PCI .
both the bi@@ valent in group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated women as well as in patients over 65 years are more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .

A@@ pi@@ dra is applied for the treatment of adults , teenagers and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , injected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm , or as continuous as an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ l@@ is@@ in differs very slight from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter effic@@ ien@@ cies are more than a short @-@ effective human@@ kind .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been examined in combination with a long @-@ term insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body could not produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
at type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first clinical study with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was reported compared to a reduction of 0.14 % when insulin l@@ is@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % involving human normal standard .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin delivery or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Germany GmbH to grant approval from A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , the th@@ igh or of the delta angle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal cutting .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin inst@@ ability , the insulin need can be decreased in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
each change of the effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - actor ) , the insulin int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ elt delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or the onset of a treatment , especially in patients with a insulin fee , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a diab@@ etic c@@ eto@@ er . these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient on the other insulin type or an insulin or any other manufacturer should be under str@@ ingent medical supervision , and can make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the effective profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change at changing the treatment schem@@ as .
increase the substances that can boost blood glucose concentrations , en@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Dis@@ eases , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ation , fi@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ lin , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , Sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ in and Reser@@ pin , can be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of ad@@ ver@@ ted counter@@ acts .
animal experiments on reprodu@@ ci@@ zing elast@@ icity showed no differences between intra@@ - solid and human @-@ insulin regarding the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin l@@ ul@@ l@@ ent occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin doesn &apos;t occur in the breast milk above , yet it will be res@@ or@@ ded according to oral application .
below are the clinical trials listed under which adverse reactions are listed ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available ) .

li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is ref@@ using to continuously change the injection of the injection area within the injection area as a result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de with consciousness can be treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately given person , or as an intraven@@ ous gift of Glu@@ k@@ osis by a physician .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine case for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating glucose levels ( especially through sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as through the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ et@@ be of insulin delivery , the mode of resistance is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em standard .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes - T@@ US showed insulin delivery effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a propor@@ tioned increase of glu@@ ing effect , just like human@@ kind .
insulin is@@ l@@ ul@@ l@@ in has a double as fast action entry like normal human@@ ities and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ities .
the data was evident that during an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ l@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ eness that will be given 30 minutes before meal .
in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ l@@ is@@ omy was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ ial control was achieved as with a human@@ eness that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin delivery is checked in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control will be given as in normal normal conditions that will be given 2 - gro@@ oves before meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery at a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : before beginning of meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin delivery ) , which was given 30 minutes ( normal - 30 minutes ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin delivery that was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ l@@ in at a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : after onset of a meal in comparison to human nor@@ ms ) that was 2 minutes ( normal - before beginning of meal ( Figure 1C ) .
