<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Development Report (EPAR) which will be evaluated as the Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP), in order to reach recommendations concerning the medication by means of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your disease or treatment, please read the package application (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. The thinking of thinking and speaking, Hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness. • bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disease, in which patients have manic episodes (periods anormaler high tuning) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify will be applied to the treatment of severe to severe episodes and for a preventive episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied for quick control of increased incorruption or behaviour of behaviour if the oral ingestation of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can be used to use or used the melting tablets in patients, where the swallow of tablets have been used.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose should be dismantled in the same way as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of inilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "Neurotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells together.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiazzole probably works as "partial Agist" for the receptors for the neurotransitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripio is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but with a lesser degree than the neurotransitter appears to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the activity of the brain is to normalize the activity of the brain to normalize the psychotic or lack of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, which restart the symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a placebo period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify were over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo which were re-evident in 160 patients, in which the lack of symptoms were already stabilized with iliating fy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which were compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotikum) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and the solution for insertion (receive).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received inilient in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly greater reduction of symptoms of symptom than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for treatment of bipolar disorder in four of the five short-term investigational symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, down to 74 weeks more effective than placebo had been treated more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and if there was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Inilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo perceived symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify for insertion (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extracurous disturbances (naughty), vomiting (naughty), vomiting (naughtiness), fatigue and vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep problems) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and serious incidents in patients who had mainly lack of episodes, and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Arimirrozole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes with bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted an approval to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for placing on demand in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used to treat high-severe episodes of bipolar indisorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly Germanic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripio zole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapor combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar indisorder in patients ≥ 65 years has been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With retrospective view of the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered to be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors are justify (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inducing is derived from combination therapy, the arithmeticyldose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides reported to psychotic diseases and affectionaries and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Arimirrozole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased risk of suicides have been compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Arimirprazole should be used with care of patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (mycotine attacks, cardiovascular diseases), shredding disorders (dehydration treatment, hypovolt, treatment with blood pressure reducer) or hypertension (including jackets and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: clinical trials, which a year or less, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Arimirrozantithesis Dyskinese.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using ABILIFY, patients were signs and symptoms of a late dyskingestion, should be applied to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has been signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear high fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripio zole should be used in patients with crampans in the ambush, or at stands that are used with cornets in the context of being used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Arimirrobenzene in patients with psycomers associated with Alzheimer's disease had treated patients who were treated with Arimirrozole, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable flaasculous events with Arimirrozole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremly and associated with ketoed or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drug, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related undesirable events that were treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, and with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Manie due to comorbidity, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is well known, or a healthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Arimirrozole on the central nervous system, caution if Arimirrozole is combined with alcohol or other centralised drugs with overlapping side effects as sediment (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonis Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Arimirrozole, but this effect will not be regarded as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased its AUC by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and paroxetin, similar effects have to be made, and that's why the similar dose can be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'Poor') Metabolizing the common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concreations compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you want to consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protector inhibitors, can have similar effects and therefore, similar dose can be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripylbenzene per day did not show any significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warcolor), and 3A4 (Dextrowel).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they become pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Arimirrozole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data for the security of humans and due to the concerns in the reproduction of the animal, this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">As well as other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including force vehicles to operate, until they are certain that Arimirrozole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or have been classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The number of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Arimirrozole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathina, Dystation and dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients with Arimirrobenzene treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Arimirrozole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanconia therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manical episodes with bipolar-I-error - In a controlled study on 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiazzolamide treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS affects 26.6% in patients with Arimirrobenzene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-time period of over 26 weeks during a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Arimagizolamide treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Arimirrobenzene and placebo, in which potentially clinically clinical changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (Kreatin-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of the patients treated with Arimirrozole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptical syndrome, late dyskinesis and crampires, adverse events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentionally or deliberations have been observed with Arimirrobenzene in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Indeed, there are no information on the effectiveness of a herbalysis in the treatment of an overdosage with Arimirrozole; however, it is unlikely that check-in in the treatment of an overdosage of benefits, because Arimirrozole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Arimirrobenzene in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-error about the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Arimirrozole showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and 5HT7- and 5HT7- to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-advergen and the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Arimirrobenzene in dosages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dosdependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caucus and by the Putname.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 patients with positive or negative symptoms, Arioch demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled study conducted in a half-controlled study, 52 percent of the response of the Response-patients who held a response to the study mediation in both groups (Arimirrozole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values made from Measurements which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly greater improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, more than 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Arimirrobenzene Group and 57% among placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanconed in-controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the most valuable patient interest rate) showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monocotrials involving more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-error, Arimirrozole showed a placebo compared to placebo in 3 weeks of reduction.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monootherapy research over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I error, Aripiazzole showed no excessive effectiveness across placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active-controlled monootherapy over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar or mixed efficacy in week 3 and an increase effect that was comparable to placebo or Haloperidol per week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week Arimirrozole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with manic or mixed-related episode, which was partially reflected on lithium batteries or Valproat-Monotherapy over a few weeks, the accompanying therapy with Arimirrozole revealed a superior efficiency when reduction in lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over a period of 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase over a period of 74 weeks before Randomisation during a stabilization phase, Aripio zole showed placebo in terms of the prevention of a bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the elongation and hydroxystole, the N-deadline is catalyzed through CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Arimirrobenzene in extensive metabolic rollers over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'Poor') Metabolisoning via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Arimirrozole there are no differences in pharmacokingenetics, between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination, schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific analysis to pharmacokinetics returned no indication to clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic cleansing or the impact of smoking at the pharmacokingenetics of Arimirrozole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Arimirrobenzene and Dehydro-Arimirrobenzene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure, compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of study with subjects with different tomb of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect as regards the impairment of the liver function at the pharmacokinetics of Arimirrozole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw smeats on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harshology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproducized elasticity, genotoxicity and to the canogens, the preclinical data had no special hazards for men.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects recorded a dosages supplementing toxicity after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds with the recommended maximum dose when people) and an increase in female rats (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the average steak state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelioration of sulfate conjugate of the hydroxycyclist in the gall of monkeys to be repeated from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1-3 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in human genes were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Arimirrozole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) in vitro solvents.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed with dosages that led to expositions in 3- and 11fold the average steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitive activities is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no serious connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubar active ingredient, which stimulates the cohaul of the microtors from the tube-indigenous and stabilizes the microtors through inhibition of its depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubal network that is essential to the vital interphase and the exotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well known that Albumni has medically conveyed in the transforming cells of Plasmathelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of Albumaxel promotes the production of Paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelift transport through the gp-60-Albuminous receptor is conveyed to a Paclitaxel accumulation in cysteine in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-blind studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion in about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-central study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mamasaxel, which received a 3-hour interfusion with a drug treatment of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">During inclusion in the study 64% of the patients had an adverse general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastestamps.</seg>

<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide-reaching extravasculous distribution and / or softwater to Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane when compared with a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-related Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-gift (43%) as a solvent-related Paclitaxel injector, and also the distribution volume was higher by Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolic in the first line to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and for two smaller metabolic rollers (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma amounted to 4% of the total dose of less than 1% of the total parabolic 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to an organic drug, that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and it contains the same active ingredient (also called "Reference Practices.").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron complications, in which a blood circulation of blood is not possible before the procedure and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with derivative must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, experience in treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own bleeding, Abseamed is inject to a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be made by the patient or his counselor, if they have received an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure and in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">Iron concentrations of all patients are to be treated before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is made, and ice-dietary supplement should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or when patients with kidney problems may be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency, or so that the body is not sufficient to meet the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a loss of blood losses.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable the formation of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with a vein in a vein in the context of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, compared with the reference agency.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients with Eprex / Erypo had been injected at least eight weeks before returning to Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main Indicator for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company also investigating the results of a study in which the effects of patients were evaluated by Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who were caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin concentrations of patients suffering from seamed patients were maintained in the same measure, as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients still received Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse event of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems), such as sudden, steamusing headaches and pervertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seducers may not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against epetalfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because other studies are necessary to ensure that this by no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) at the conclusion that the medicine has been produced in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and safety profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Allegitioning symptoms and follicts may vary depending on the age, gender and total disease load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin is by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients, some patients can occasionally be observed with individual hemoglobin values above or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given that hemoglobin variability should be tried on a corresponding dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value is increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">The patients should be monitored in order to ensure that epetin alfa in the lowest approved dose, which is required for controlling the anemy and Annoisymptome is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initial hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients where the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initial hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients where the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that is attributable to the gift of epetines if the hemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration of incentiful ympans and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidonary heart disease or dust-sufficiency should not be exceeded during maintenance therapy, under section 4.2, the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to present knowledge, the treatment of anemy with epetalfa with kidney failure, which are not subject to dialysis, will not accelerate the risk of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumor patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epetin-alfa gift and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who need to be transfated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increases greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a half-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical-related anemy - dose adjustments with the goal to keep the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR to the public this document is a summary of the European Public Development Report (EPAR) which describes the work carried out in the field of human medicine (CHMP), in order to reach recommendations concerning the use of medication.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), where metformin (a diabetic medication) is not shown. • It can be applied together with a different diabetic medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), that cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulyl / insulin or insulin, the previous dose of sulphuryls or insulin may be retained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphuryls or insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be recycled and sinking blood sugar levels, so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the effectiveness of Actos were examined in tripletherapy and patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphurylmaterial, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glycoylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured as the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease of the HbA1c value, which allows blood glucose levels in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy studies, the effect of additional charge of Actos in an existing treatment with metformin and a sulphurylative material showed a decrease of the HbA1c-values by 0.94%, while the additional charge of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin have been examined, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin, a reduction of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual impairments, infections of the upper respiratory passages (cold reviews), weight gain, and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to zzen).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, yet in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic cetoed (high Ketonlevel - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission issued an approval to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited issued a approval for the account of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and incompatible with the metformations due to contraindications or incompatibilities (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There is no data available for use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. prior heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decompensated heart failure could begin to develop a decompensated heart failure, should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">The patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain or ecdecks, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain and ecdecks, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing genetic disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that point to a conventional dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, appetite, fatigue, appetite, appetite, and / or darker Harn, are to check the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to determine whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon is expected to be conducted by the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials involving Pioglitazone, a dosdependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be soiling of fat deposits and linked to some cases with a liquid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hamburdening under the therapy of Pioglitazon, a slightly reduction of the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and at lower extent also in patients with sulphurism and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin content, patients who receive Pioglitazone as orale two or triple-combination therapy with a sulphurylic acid or as a two-combination therapy with insulin delivery, the risk of dosdependent mortar.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment of ThiazolidIndians, including Pioglitazone, about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema was reported with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of macular decks, but disordnating doctors should be aware of a macular edema, when patients may report on disruption of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events of randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated prefix incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures were treated with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes or leave a pregnancy or defends the treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions shown that Pioglitazon showed no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical production of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptiva, Cyclosporin, calcium Carbonara and HMGCoA Rektasehemmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibromine (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperasteroon and increased insulin resistance of the maternity is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fond growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turgor and refractive index of the lens as well as in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon the three times the upper limit of the standard range is often equal to less than placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups of metformin or sulphurylmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study with patients with advanced macrovascular condition, the frequency of a heavy heart failure was reduced by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone was less than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely has been reported on congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summary analysis of messages irreplacements from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparable medical groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of the PROactive trial, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days stood no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to work on an activating specific receptor (Peroxisome proliferation by Recepor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitive stability of liver, fat and skeleton muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclade versus Gliclade as Monotherapy was continued over two years in order to assess the period up to the subsequent therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years of therapy, blood glucose control could be defined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study on 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was randomized with insulin, in spite of three immune phase, to pianlitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c reduced the value of 0.45% compared to patients who have continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotation compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy of 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited examination of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone was compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide the total plasma glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, a statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected while under Metformin and Gliclacide was observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postdendial triglyceride mirror, this is also reflected on the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorded, with the top concentration on the unchangeable Pioglitazon's plasma is usually taken 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This basis corresponds to the post of M-IV for efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical production of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibromine (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 Incensored) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-induction) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After a radioactive application of radioactive Pioglitazone on humans, the marker was found mainly in barrels (55%) and at a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours at humans 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolic rollers is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concreations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy volunteers and resemble itself.</seg>
<seg id="818">In the toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree to the repetitive administration of Plasmaification with hages, anemy and reversible eccentric cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperasteroon and increased insulin resistance of the maternity is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fond growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased tendencies of hyperplasia (male and female rats) were induces in male rats (male rats) and tumours (male rats).</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-like polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other ThiazolidIndians led to an increased frequency of Kolontumres.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated prefix incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures were treated with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study on two years, the effects of combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Gliclacide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials, more than 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotation compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but improved the postdendial triglyceride mirror, this is a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption, as well as to the multi-triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study demonstrated its goal in terms of its primary mortal, non-deadly myyocardial syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, lay the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not related to cardiovascular risk risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages adverse events, randomised, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon and showed an increased incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparable medical treatment.</seg>

<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c-Spiegels, pointing out that the blood sugar level has been lowered as much as with other humankind.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may be sensitive to human-quality (allergic) or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by a more intense insulin therapy, the hypoglycemic warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type, long labeling (insist insulin, human insulin or insulin delivery) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA in animal origin) can lead to that a change in the dosage is required.</seg>

<seg id="876">Some patients in which hypoglycemic reactions emerged after a change of animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travel, which are over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to catch the advice of his doctor, as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken in meals at other times.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft has already been used in the EU, the company submitted the results of the study conducted by Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study was presented to 668 patients with renal transplantation where the application was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Cicar porin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Main Indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplantation was delayed after a period of treatment of a year (example, how often a renewed organ transplant or a recovery of dialysis required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies of 119 patients were performed with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraf is included in comparison to Prograf / Prograft from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with etric sensitivity (allergy) against Tacrolimus, Macroid antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or one of the other components should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful if others (especially some herbal) drugs can be taken at the same time with Advagraf as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the medication may be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immune system and treatment of transplants should be attributed to this medicine or make changes in the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects, including lower or superiority.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain the appropriate daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tight control of one in the corneal transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic medication monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The Advagraf dosage should be based on the clinical evaluation of derivative and tolerability in the case and on blood-level provisions (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After upgrading from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus-Talspiegel should be controlled over two weeks before conversion and over two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposition was measured as valley mirror, with both formulation as well as with kidney transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks of transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf file schemas can take several days until the steady State reaches.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations for transplant transplant prophylaxis of transplantation Preagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Additional dose adjustments may later be necessary, because the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus in the course of stabilisation of patients can be changing after the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft therapy The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dossiers recommended - conversion from prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a daily dose of prograf capsules to a daily intake of Advagraf. this changeover in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the whole daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a changeover of other immunosiva on Cagraf once a day, treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the prophylaxis of transplant will begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are encircled to Cagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers though there are no clinical experience with Advagraf at lunchas- and dared transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancrewaged patients at a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with collateralized transplants at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosisadaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintaining blood skills in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver problems.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function as the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrases potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum increinininspiegel, calculation of creatinin) and a monitoring of urinary volume is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover of Cicar porin to Advagraf at the changeover of a Cicar porter on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is not offered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the Talmud mirror in full blut The dose should be based on clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in the case of infertilisation of full-blood-Tacrolimus-valley level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talmud mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley level of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after upgrading from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adjustments, changes in immune-intensive therapy or at the same use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus blood concentrate (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is an drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the steamady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the Talmud mirror of Tacrolimus are usually in the first time according to liver transplantations usually in the range from 5 to 20 ng / ml and in hinges - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant, blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplant changes or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus Unter- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain the appropriate daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tight control of one in the corneal transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with grafts, which has been proved by other Immunoghava as a therapist, no clinical data for the rescue formulation Advagraf are still present.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of transplant transplant at adult's transplant help and transplant changes in childhood there are yet no clinical data for the rescue formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interaction that can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus level in blood and to a attenuation of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable preparations (hypericum perforated date) is contained, or other vegetable consumption during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a diomyopathy was described as a cartoonist, or septum hypertropic to observe, which can therefore occur under the agraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disruptions are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticioids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid loads and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other Immunogressiva, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection factor with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus symptoms, symptoms such as headaches, change consciousness and visual impairment should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Because Advagraf Hartkapert, Aactose is contained in patients with the rare hereditary type actose tolerance, Lactase-deficiency or glucose-galactose-mactose.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable medications are known as inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing the blood pressure of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to set the Tacrolimus dose towards maintaining equivalent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction with anti-boycotics such as Ketoconazol, flight condubol, Itraconazol and Vorosol as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV-protesters (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetical studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of the gastrointestinal contamination, resulting from the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly efficient prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute disabling actions, can increase or decrease the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect from Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabated by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus, the Clearance of steroid contraceptiva, in order to increase the hormone exposure, is especially careful in decisions of the contracous measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experimentation have shown that Tacrolimus potentially decrease Clearance of Pentobarbitral and phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations into grafts of transplants do not provide evidence that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other Immunoghava an increased risk for adverse events in terms of course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of newborns is recommended to potential harmful effects of Tacrolimus (in particular with its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on non-malignant or malignant Neoplasm including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high level of erythrocytes and plasma cutting can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysing.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacological effects on the molecular layer should be conveyed to the effects of Tacrolimus by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the contact of the connection of the cellulers.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal production in the T cell and prevents the transcription of a certain set of Lymphokin genen.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application are to be addressed to whether Advance is applied to the treatment of bleeding in surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII-deficiency, which causes blood-related problems such as blood vessels in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa will not extract from ordinary plasma, but according to a method described as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which was introduced into a gene (DNA) that it is capable of formation of the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different medicines approved by the European Union called recurombinate, similar, but it does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate Hämophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the medication of the medicine was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advances in the prevalence of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood cells was awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advance (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against human scent factor VIII, mouse or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a approval from the European Commission of Baxter AG, issued an approval for Advance in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage intake and duration of the subsidy therapy are based on the severity of a factor VIII-deficiency, according to the place and the degree of blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following domestic events, the factor VIII activity will not drop under the specified plasma bricks (in% of the norm or in i.e. i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and the acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is past.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course it is enriched to control the dose and frequency of injections a reasonable determination of the factor VIII-plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different sewerage times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis In patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40, i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected value of VIII-Plasmaactivities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if necessary, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective such that other therapeutic measures need to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The average speed is to be applied after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII and IgG immigrants in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing the inhibitors is correlated with the extent of the exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk of the risk of genetic and other factors depends on the largest and genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 wells and anamstically-known inhibitors, after upgrading from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, re-appear (lowest) Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare reiteration of Hämophilia A in women over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still no experiences before.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs inhibitors were enrolled against factor VIII (5 patients), which were treated with previously untreated patients who have increased risk of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (frequency on basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of blood-spinning factor VIII-Spiegels came to surgery (10 - 14 postoperative day) in one patient under continuous ADVATE Infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The bleeding within the whole period was exciting and both the factor VIII- mirror in plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial authorization data, the CHMP has continued to be considered a positive rating, but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">The CHMP is based on the basis of safety filter from ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the marketing activity may apply for further extensions in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee of Human Use agent (CHMP) that the company will take his application upon approval for the treatment of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, the breast, the brain, the brain, or the soften parts (tissues that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and support) it is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, genetically modified so that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When the virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which was so altered, that there is no copies of itself, and thus no infections can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of non-defective in the human body-p53 gene, is normally made to restore deleted DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company recorded data from a study with a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the undermining, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has tested the answers to the questions that had already been checked, some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the test of the initially submitted documents the CHMP covers a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, the injection of Advance in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has been advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of appointments and the security of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advance can be established in reliable mode and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, harmful to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't know the CHMP, whether the Impact consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassio Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the drug release means that the tablets have so assembled so that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly will be released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (Heuckle, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal muctival swelling (blocked nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The major contributors were the changes in the severity of the Heule nymptome, which were reported from the patient before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients presented their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering the posting of all the Heule nymptome, the patients reported a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9%, compared with 35.9% of patients suffering from the Pseudoephedron alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of the Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tacho, psychosis (appetite disease), anstipation, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (strokes), somnolenz (strokes), sleep problems and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephek or one of the other components, against admissible ingredients or Loratadin (other medicines for the treatment of allergies), are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aimaze should also not be applied in patients who suffer from a risk factor (high blood pressure), cardiac disease (hyperthochre), hyperthyroose (overlation of thyroid) or have a hemisprhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhage surgery) or have a risk for a hematrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a approval from Aerinaze to the European Union by Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is in whole to swallow it (i.e. without it to break, to break or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data to infertility and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long as long-term application can take off the activity of pseudoephew in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decrease of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment with Desloratadin can be continued as monotherapysis.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Asiaze Pseudoephek contains, the drug is also contaminated in patients who will be treated with a monooxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors like Bromockery, Dihydroergoamin, Dihydroergoamine, cihydroergoamine, phenols or nasal phrases (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrin, epheers, Oxyerazza, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy have not been checked for this patient's disease and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed about that treatment in case of hypertonia or a tachometer, cardiovascular problems, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups: patients under digital patients • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myyocardial infarction in the anamity, diabetes mellitus, bladder instruction or bronze Erasmus in the anamity.</seg>
<seg id="1678">At least 48 hours before performing dermatologic tests, an antihistopathic tests can otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical tests with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition, no clinical relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">There were no significant differences between those treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo, irrespective of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The metabolic disorders of Desloratadin responsible enzyme was not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin-vivo CYP3A4 does not have, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The infertility of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies but no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and should not be used on the basis of vasoconstrictoral properties of pseudoephew should not be used in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it can come to a dizziness which can lead to interference or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a standard depression (sediment, Apnoe, low spiritual attention, cyanaesthesia) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treads, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, fear, frightening, musculosis and increased muscle tension, Euphoria, arousal, nausea, naughtiness, nausea, vomiting, dicular pain, dicular pain, tondicular pain, hypotonia or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially important for children, as well as Atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupgaze, skin irritation, hyperthermia, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastine / basophilic acid as well as the expression of the expression of the P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">During a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight, including the amplification of subjectivity or tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg, no increased frequency of stroking in comparison to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephew in the recommended dosage may request a further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer, or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergenic rhinitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonist efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined on the basis of the total amount for symptoms of symptoms (except nasal mucuffs), significantly higher than under a monotherapist in the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effects, determined by the nasal mucuffs, was significantly higher than under a monotherapial with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic state groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose study of pharmacokinetics from Aerinaze, Desloratadwithin 30 minutes is detectable within the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the floating weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephek was achieved in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic surplus study, which was performed using the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, the four subjects of Desloratadin poorly modified.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components Interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephew exploded according to the sole gift of pseudoepheet bioequivalent was the exposure to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harshology, toxicity at recurring gift, for genotoxicity and reproducizing elasticity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can not recognize any special hazards for men.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed were generally in connection with the table Pseudoephew inside.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducible studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephew was given in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the approval of the pharmaceutical handvigilanzas system is established and works before and during the product on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged 6 to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or w.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was tested in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergenic rhinitis (including four trials for seasonal rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the change of symptoms (juckles, number and size of quadrupeds, insist of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Other studies have been presented to verify that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take and the melting tabletins have been recycled as the tablets and use of children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">For allerginal Rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to a decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of urine, the acceptance of symptoms came after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius should not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted approval by SP Europe to grant approval from Aerius to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent rhinitis) and Urzuaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of Desloratadin for young people from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current level of disease and may be stopped after the symptoms of symptoms and resumed in their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During persistent rhinitis (the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during allergy periods.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in the clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythroromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, at the same time taking Aerius and alcohol, alcohol has not increased the effective effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it can come to dizziness which can lead to interference or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergenic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urine, 3% more adverse reactions were reported in patients with aserius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that was more common than when compared to placebo was fatigue (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event of headaches was treated with 5.9% of the patients who were treated with Desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple-dose study, which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were given, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human maids / Basophilic as well as the expression of the expression of the P-selection of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of clinical study with multiple doses, given in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, was given no statistically significant or clinically important cardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin at a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth dose) was given over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dossier study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of the flight, including the amplification of subjectivity or tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergenic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the case of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and juckles of nose, juckles, trench and coaching of the eyes and itchy on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into dependence between the duration of the symptoms and also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Pertinent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As is shown on the overall size of cargo to life quality at Rhino-Sttivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden of seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urine was investigated, as the underlying pathophysiology was investigated, because the underlying pathology was similar to the allegology in the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of contamination with all urinary diseases is expected that Desloratadin except for chronic idiopathic uranium is expected to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urine, Aerius became effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the position of quadrupeds at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistopathic uria, the minority was the minority of patients who did not react to antihistopathic studies.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement in the juckles by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to the evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In an pharmaceutical ingenetics study, which were comparable to patients with general seasonal rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of Desloratadine was achieved at 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no occasion for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme was not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (low-fat, calory breakfast) is not available to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out by Desloratadin and Loratadin conducted by Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of the toxicity of deserts by Desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and reproducizing elasticity, the preclinical data of Desloratadin can be seen in no special hazards for men.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains Lactose-Monohydrate, Hyaeccable, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colouring film (includes hythats, Macrogol 400), carcases baited, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent rhinitis) and Urzuaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribed physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections, anatomical anomalies ought to play a role in diagnosis, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 abolize Desloratadin and find out a higher subsidy load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of aserius syrup with children between 2 and 11 years, fully metabolic, is identical to that of children who are metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medication contains Saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-type absorbing or a sucrose-insom- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythroromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, at the same time taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, alcohol has not increased the effective effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total hardness of adverse events at children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup-group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergenic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more adverse reactions when patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multiple-dose study of adults and adolescents, given up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinical effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11, who arrived for an antihistamine therapy, received a daily disaster dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urism and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children can be similar, can be extrapolated the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults to the children's population extrapolated.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the framework of clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically important cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin at a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials suggested at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of stroking in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets carried out in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for no impairment of psychic motor.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which could cause a trunk of influenza virus which could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemic breaks off when a new tribe of influenza virus is absorbed, which can easily spread to human beings because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the end of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus as "physical seed" and is antibody against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This is the result of the immune system to form a contact with influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a physical sense), are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">In this way, the scope of clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the provisions of the EMEA for prehenish vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules as a solution is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of these combination has not been examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should then be classified, if the doctor has checked, which has previously taken antiviral medicines of the patient before, and the probability is that the virus is angled to the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, together with 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children from four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase according to body weight.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been examined in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without neitonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults, which had not been treated with protest.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenase medicines with low-based Ritonavir reinforced drug Agenase was compared with 206 adults, compared with other protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (Virus last) or the change of viruslast according to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had previously taken no protest-inhibitor, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In the case of children, Agenase also decreased the viruslast, but of the children who had been treated with Protected bodies, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protesters, the drug Agenase increased the viruslast after 16-week treatment as well as other proteins as well:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV that was resistant against four other protesters, it came under Agenase with Ritonavir to a stronger refuse of the viral load of Viruslast for four weeks than in patients receiving their previous proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (divinity), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and barrels (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to amonavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may not be applied in patients, the Johannis weeds (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are the same as Agenase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, in patients who take Agenase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the allocation of body fat), an osteonekeezebox (symptoms of a bone tissue) or an immunological activation (symptoms of infection which are caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in application in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the use of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have a Protected inhibitor is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "unusual circumstances," because of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Limited issued a approval for the launch of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protonehemmer (PI) pre-treated adults and children over 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules should usually be administered for pharmacokavir by Amonavir together with low doses of raisonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amonavir should be performed under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amonavir as a solution for insertion is 14% less than a capsule; therefore asorase capsules and solution are not interchangeable to form a milligrams per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Amonavir twice daily, together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the stronger addition of Ritonavir (Bookings), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral treatments up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amplitude which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asosase in combination with low doses of rats or other protesters have not been investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to incompatibility and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily, and in patients with severe liver problems to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should occur in patients with mild or disrupted liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder in patients (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates substrates des Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the curacy (hypericum perforated date) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of amonavir during the intake of amonavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they can also develop opportunist infections, or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment of Agenase did not prevent the risk of transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are treated in chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy, have an increased risk of serious liver failure with potentially fatal dose.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting liver function including a chronic active hepatitis, showed an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glucoquoidal metastasis is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of treatment in the risk of systemic coroid arthritis, including mordial infarction and suppression of the epithelial function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the prevention of HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous appointment of Agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of elevated risk of myopathies, including Rhabityolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbiteval, phenictoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards ratios), are available methods for determining the concentration concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Agenase may be less effective because of reduced plasma tiles (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva may be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If Methadon is given at the same time by Amonavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for opiatric symptoms, in particular if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity after the high propylating content of the Agenase solution, this formulation is made with children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protesters, has been reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exazure of existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy, which are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical - dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">At ugingophilic patients (type A and B), reports were treated with protonists, reports on an increase of blood vessels including a spontaneous hematome and hematthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-inflammatory combination therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual infections, which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifunctional etching is assumed (including use of corticioids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunointments, higher body-mass index), cases of osteoneksis have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV-infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates substrates the P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenase with Ritonavir must not be combined with medicines that are mainly used primarily via CYP2D6 and to increased plasma tiles with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC by Amonavir, which can lead to a virology and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lowest plasma bricks by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Curacy (hypericum perforated date) The serenspiegel from Amonavir can be matched by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with curacy (hypericum perforated date).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes by Johannis, the amonaviest mirror and, if possible, add the virusload and add the curvy.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for any of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amonavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased for Cmax by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amonavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg Amonavir have been applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which indicate the effectiveness and immunity of this treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amonavir (750 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amonavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), is approximately 40 to 50% lower than Amonavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous appointment of Amonavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended to use a tight monitoring, as the effectiveness and immunity of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use Agenase in combination with didanosin, but due to the antadem component of Didanosin, it is recommended that the income of Didanosin and Agenase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, for a gift of Efavirenz in combination with Amonavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amonavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, since the exposure of both proteins would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protonehemmer and existing limited data can be suspect that Nevirapin lowers the serum concentration of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution, because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or subtherapeutic plasma bricks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are applied together, caution; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring will be made, as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Amonavir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amonavir and Ricontrol utin led to an increase in Plasmaconation (AUC) by Ricontrol utin by 193%, thereby resulting in an increase in the associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If clinical reasons is required for clinical reasons, Ricontrol utin together with Agenase is necessary, at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies in combination with erythroromycin were not performed, but the plasma tiles of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneously appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg of fossils, and 100 mg Ritonavir once daily led to an increase in Cmax of Ketoconazol once daily with a value of 2.69mm compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazol once daily without concurrent use of fossils with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor, induction of CYP3A4, can be used together with Agenase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions, which are monitored by these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protonehemmer, it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenase as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulsiva, which are known as enzymes (phenobarbitan, Phenbamazepin), with Amonavir can lead to a reduction in plasma tiles of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calciumkanalblocks such as Amlodipin, Diligazem, Felodipin, hairpin pin, crocodipin, Nimodipin, nib pin, Nite pin and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by amonavir, which may increase activity and toxicity of this drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Agenase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in connection with side effects including hypotlima, vision disorders and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times a day), the fluid casonpropionate plasma is significantly increased, while the endogenous Cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% -account interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous application of Agenase with Ritonavir is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of treatment in the risk of systemic concoroid arthritis (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose failure is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to be expected to expect Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma pressure increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy, including one Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by amonavir by the same gift (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be applied together with oral-adopted middzolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same time it is commanded by Agenase with parental Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parental Midazolam with other protections indicate an possible increase in plasma tiles of Midazolam around the 3- up to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If Methadon is administered together with Amonavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for opiatric symptoms, in particular if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical clubs, no recommendation can be given, like the amonavior dose when amonavir is administered with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For the same gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, an increased control of the INR (International Standards ratios) is recommended because of the possibility of a dethrombal effect or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional appointment of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptiva is not predictable, therefore an alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Northern trypical) is recommended for the same gift of Agenase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful weakening of the possible uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk, Amonavir-related substances have been demonstrated, however, it is not known if amonavir passes away in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on dreaming rats, which was administered by the penetrate in the uterus up to the end of the nursing time Amonavir, showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impacted by the appointment of Amonavir to the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The impurity of Agenase was investigated in adults and with children from 4 years in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects associated with the Agenase treatment were easy to uniformly expressed, came early on and led rarely to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenase or another at the same time for the HIV treatment of applied medicines, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the mentioned side effects come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients do not pre-treated patients 1200 mg of Agenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) were evaluated by the test doctors in connection with the study mediation and were listed below 1% of the patients as well below the treatment of laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral therapy therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy), including a loss of periphery and covered fat tissues, hypertropic of the breasts and dorsovical fat content (stem).</seg>
<seg id="2009">With 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated people who had been treated with amortavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (pins) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTIME was treated with 245 patients (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin-setbacks are usually easily identified, eryatous or maculous nature, with or without juckles, as a rule, during the second treatment of treatment, and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without having to be demolished with amonavir treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonekeezebra cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-infection or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the cases of HIV-infected patients with severe immunation effect, an anti-inflammation therapy (ART) can develop a anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residuous membranes (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients treated with PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenase twice daily together with low dosed Ritonavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception to increases the triglyceride and CPK values, which received Agenase together with low-sized Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose the patient is on signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, necessary actions are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amonavir is binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processian viral disease and Gag-pol- polyproteins, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amonavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphobic bacteria lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitors (IC50) of Amonavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 μm in acute cells and amounts to 0,41 µm for chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amonavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication of people is not defined yet.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral patients with the currently approved fossils / Ritonavir doses - as with other Ritonavir-ooed treatment schemes - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the case of sixteen from 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of fossils with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virologarithmetic could be examined until week 48, whereby 14 isolate genotypical could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of Isolate of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included, showed resistance patterns that were similar to adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11V, K20S, I33E, M46I / L, I4V, I4V, I7V, I71V, I72A / I, I82A / I, I82A / I, I84V, I90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamonavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) were treated with virologarithmetic patients over 96 weeks, the following protonehemmer mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">According to genotypical resistance tests, Genotypical interpretations can be used to assess the activity of Amonavir / Ritonavir or Fosamonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protonehemmer-resistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamonavir / Ritonavir, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I / V / S / EC, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypical resistance to fossils with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virology (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutationists are subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to attract the current interpretations for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">According to phenotypical resistance tests, clinically validated phenotypical interpretations can be used in combination with genotypic data to assess the activity of Amonavir / Ritonavir or Fosamonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protonehemmer-resistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to distribute diagnostic resistance tests, clinically developing clinically-phenotypic Cut-off (dividing points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to evaluate results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four, with a reduced sensitivity against amonavir and associated genetic patterns, a certain Crusaders against Ritonavir, the sensitivity of indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between Amonavir and other protesters for all 4 fossil fuels, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), baboavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates) and Tidenonavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amonavir retains its activity against some other protest-resistant insulators; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations to the insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early demolition of a different treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily based on PROFonavir (600 mg twice daily) and a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to asosase, at least one another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-perplexity of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group (HIV-1 RNA) in the Viruslast period (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underlining wave of 0,4-10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">It is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenase solution was given in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of patients treated with PI pretreated patients had been given at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the patients with Agenase administered together with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml when the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered as expected for treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children of unleathing "Agenase."</seg>
<seg id="2043">The average duration (max.) up to maximum serum concentration of Amonavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for each capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amonavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The appointment of Amonavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady State state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the magnitude and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approx. 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed on a large distribution volume, as well as a unhindered pendulum by amonavir from the blood circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma, whereby the amount of unbundling amonavir, which represents the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbundling Amonavir remains constant, the percentage share of free active components during the dosing intervals of Cmax, ss, up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that are inducing the CYP3A4 inducing or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4 can be delivered with caution if they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amonavir exposure, such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amonavir is made from the solution 14% less bids than from the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable to a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a renal impact on the elimination of Amonavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatments schemes lead to amonavir plasma pressure similar to those who are generated from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amonavir twice daily without simultaneous appointment of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on mice with Amonavir on mice and rats joined forces with male animals or 3.8- fold (rat) of the exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the partitives Adenomas and Karzinome was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observed effects for the human being is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">This report on the people, both clinical trials and the therapeutic use, however, showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial lymphoma test, micro-core test on rats and chromosome test, Amonavir was neither presumed nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Up to date, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the appointment of Agenase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies of toxicity in young people who were treated with an age of 4 days showed, both in the control and with the Amonavir treated animals showed a high mortality.</seg>

<seg id="2291">Althirazyme treated patients can develop infuelling reactions, which are defined as any adverse effect as any related effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the Infusion Day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored constantly, and the infusion of Althirazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, in which revive facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase form, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibody or symptoms of infucking response must be treated with caution by aldurazyme using caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As a little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, risk provisioning must be careful due to theoretically increased risk-reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data of newborns, which were expelled against laronidase about breast milk, is recommended, not to feed during the treatment with Althirazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were classified predominantly in clinical trials, which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse reactions related to Althirazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often performed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history, there was severe reactions like bronchospasmus, breathing and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most patients, there occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a serokonversion, whereby it usually occurred in the patients at the age of 5, compared to a serokonversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to an early retirement from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radioactive opitation (RIP) assay detectable antibody, among them 3 patients who never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of a low-antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the day mirror in the harn, while in patients with high antibodies to indicate a variable reduction of gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal effect to the enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies could not be found in connection with the incidence of adverse pharmaceutical activities, even if the occurrence of adverse reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of encumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is removed from the cycle and recorded by cells into the Lysosomes, the most likely to be the most likely than man-6 phosphorus.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Althirazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebokcontrolled phase-3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the entire disease spectrum was raised from the median of phenotype and only one patient rejected the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forctionated volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute enclosure in the 6-minute test.</seg>

<seg id="2324">Out of the 26 patients with a hepatoma (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the Gag-Spiegel was detected in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine), who remained constant up to the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous pathation between the patients suffering from a combined end point, the clinically significant change in a 6-minute test has been summarised (compared to expected percentage of patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year-old open phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical ingenetics of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients, at the time of its inclusion in the study below 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy processing form and 4 with the medium-running form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage for increased GAG- mirrors have been increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was diagnosed with the mean age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium-running form shows a normal mental developmental rate, whereas in the older patients were limited limited or even a progress in cognitive performance.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic and fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang along with the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of recorded fat is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The few things are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rarely (frequency on basis of available data).</seg>

<seg id="2531">† Es is plausibel, that the treatment with alli to convert to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects can lead.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">During the majority of reported cases reported by orlistat-Surdoation, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigation on human and animal, it may be out of a fast back-formation of any systemic effects, which are attributed to the lifeehematic properties of orlistat.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied for chemotherapists, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapists who are a trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dioxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by an additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetric).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, since the effects in this age group is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug of chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), preventing the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies involving 1 842 adults who received chemotherapists who are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapists, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients who were treated with Aloysius, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapists, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are 81% of patients who were treated with Aloysius, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 by 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloysietron (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued an approval from Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. issued a approval for the on-traffic of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily damaged chemotherapy due to cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting on moderate chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting that is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding one before the mticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can prolong the thicknage, patients should be monitored by anamnesty Obstification or signs of an subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or those that tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further Chemotherapeutics gift magi is supposed to be used in the days after the chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron intreated the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a jetty concentration of Metoclopramids, one CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based on CYP2D6 Inspiri, Celecoxib, chloroxetubicin, dooxetubicin, oxetonavir, Citonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin, had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to application of Palonosetron in human gestures are not available, so Palonosetron should not be applied to fluctuations, unless it is necessary to be considered to be treated by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most frequently observed effects of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitive actions and reactions to the concert venue (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reviews.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar houses showed undesirable events as in other dosing groups; no dose-effective relations were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume. however, a dialysis may probably not have effective therapy for a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 coxorubicin and 250 micrograms, or 100 mg dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously to Day 1 without Dutethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with heavily emetoed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials investigating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameter, including the QTc interval and the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionic and Repolarisation of the Ionic channels and extend the duration of the potential potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the ECG effects of I.M., in single doses of 0.25, 0.75, and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After an intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of Plasmaconcreations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionately in the total dose range of 0.3 - 90 m g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations emerged that at a time of a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) reached a total of 0.75 mg measured by one-time intravenous administration; however, the Cmax is 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% of the kidneys will be eliminated and roughly 50% are converted into two primary metabolic ties, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at Metabolism of Palonosetron are involved.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron, as unchangeable effect, made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous bolt, the overall physical activity of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In the eyes of patients with severe liver disorder the terminal Elimination period and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is however nonjustified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of preclinical trials showed evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can be involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose discharged in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which have been given every day over two years, led to a multiplied frequency of liver tumors (in thyrosis, hemisprupemark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) adopted a negative result in which the approval of the approval of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injector solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to an organic medicines called Roferon-A with the same arzazi-effective ingredient that has already been approved in the EU (also called "Reference Deterant").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpacon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (one by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue has damage caused, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanyaminotransferase (ALT) increases the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast which was introduced to a gene (DNA) that stimulates the effect of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data in front of the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active component structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effective mode, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference value to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients were treated after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns that the data on the stability of the active substance and the medication were not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjustment of treatment with alphabet, the disease occurs in more patients than with the reference pharma-agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was used in the study to investigate the question that is how long the medication forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) dissolves, not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used to treat impetigo (one with crucify intoxication) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or chipping), poor and genetically modified wounds are applied.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, proven or probably caused by methicillinicccus aureus (MRSA) because the alarm against this kind of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient had not responded to the treatment after two to three days, the physician should examine and pull out alternative treatments to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts with blockade of bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection had failed by the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">During the treatment of infected skin results, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were combined with skin dogs, about 90% of patients were treated in both groups on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo has been observed that Altargo on the treatment of abortions (outfilled hollow spaces in the body tissue) or from infections, which were proven or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse event with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo on a short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections across the risks are: • Impetigo, • infected small lainations, poor or genomitted wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued an approval from the Glaxo Group Ltd. granted approval for the Inverse of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, in which no improvements could occur within two to three days, should be considered once more and an alternative-alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment was canceled, the saline is carefully sealed and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin shall not be applied for the treatment of infections, which MRSA is known as pathogen or is assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials, secondary wounds was the efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections, which caused by a methicillin-resistant forklilococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvements or deterioration of infected places.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma conspirals that were reached after the topical application on sloping skin or identified superficial wounds, a clinically important inhibition in vivo is not expected to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous use of 2 times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazol, the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased to the skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments will not be held for necessary if topical retinapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduce elasticity after oral taking and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of Retapamulin is preferable by the use of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / ended, or the therapy with Altargo continues to be completed, between the benefit of the nursing infant treatment and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo applied, the most frequently reported adverse event of Irritation on the booking site, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Deriromutilin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis due to interaction on a specific binding point of the bacterial Ribosomes, which differs from binding other ribosomal interagating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding point of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and transferred in the region of the ribosomal P-Binary centre and the Peptidylmarket centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binding point, Pleuromutiline block the peptide, block some P-binding interactions and prevent regular formation of active 50s-bosses.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the use of the local prevalence of the resistance to the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms may appear, a consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to the treatment in S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion and placed on sloped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma maple were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure took place in the days 3 or 4 in adult patients and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording on humans after topical application of 1% Salbe applied to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUD (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxide in human liver microsomed was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out more than 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro verification in gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or into cultures of human-ymphocytes cells as well as in the rats test test for the in-vivo study chromosomaler effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male fertility for oral fertility at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day so that one up to 5 times higher exposure has been achieved as the highest exposure in humans (topical application at 200 cm2):</seg>

<seg id="2715">The holder of approval is obliged to perform detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilanzable activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation procedure, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Ginal products' for human use, the updated RMP has to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Stimulating or other signs and symptoms in the treated spot are to end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface that is treated with Altargo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips or in the female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affects the liver) in children between the ages of 15 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be used within one of two doses existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunisation has a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and is ensured that the vaccination will be able to end up from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is required, ambirix or another hepatitis B or -b vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may affect the immune system (the natural death of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contain the same components as the vaccinated vaccine of Twinrix Children since 1996 and the vaccine of Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same disease, but Twinrix Adrix and Twinrix Children are administered within the framework of one out of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix Adrix, also used as cover for use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indebator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix carried out a month after the last injection between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated antibodies to hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was in a six-month distance between the injections were similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, pain on the injection of the injection, Roman, matter (fatigue) as well as maturity.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (a antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. issued a approval for the return of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic munitions with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">In case of hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated for hepatitis B as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalant vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C surface anti-hepatitis C (anti-HBsAg) of anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same range as after vaccination with the respective monovalant vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet secured, whether immune-competent people who have spoken to an hepatitis A- vaccine will need to be a refresher than protection, as they may be protected by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections, for the rare case of an anaphysctic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quicker protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended to combine the 360 ELISA units for the inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With herbalysis and persons with disruptions the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are achieved, so in these cases the gift of another vaccine will be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramusculous administration can lead to an optimal impedance to be avoided, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">For Thrombozytopenia or blood odinnate disorders, Ambirix can be injected, as an exception subcutaneous formulation, as it can occur in these cases after intramusculation gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellulthrem, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined masking Mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immune therapy or patients with immune effects, no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation of adults was the frequency of pain, Roman, swelling, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever similar with the incidence that observed in earlier Thiomerate and preservatives vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix was administered by a total of 1027 vaccine at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher doses of pain and matter on a calculation basis per vaccinated Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a 3-dose combination impedance.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle reported 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix over pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable to difference (i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix compared with 36.2% of the subjects which received 3-doses of combination.).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of preeminent pain and matter was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old vaccination, the appearance of local interactions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup is comparable to that with the 3-doses Cominactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, between the 6- and 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a little bit of pain (at the injection rate) per dose, not reported per rate.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that have severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with a combination-activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B- surface antigen, was statistically significant differently.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were performed in vaccination at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6, administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6, administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study conducted at 12- up to and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people, their immunity were evaluated, the seroprotator rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response shown in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after the completion of the full vaccination (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination-impedance with 360 ELISA units (inactivated hepatitis C virus and 10µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of basic munisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to that of 3 doses with a combination-impedance, consisting of 360 ELISA units forminactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-old, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time using a combined slide mechanism, Tetanus-, azellulthrem Pertussisans (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined masculps vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation of adults showed similar seroprotation- and serokonversion rates such as the former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is inspect both before and after respaying, to inspect documents and / or physical alterations.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark roots, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellowed) and other symptoms that may need to do a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not protect Ambirix from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are already infected by hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus if you are already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus (although she / her child can't feel unlikely or ill, it may not prevent any vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections, which are causing liver refuse or symptoms which are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of the vaccine, including Neomycin (a antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can persist through juckling skin irritation, respiratory or irritating face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and usually the second vaccine dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">For a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of more effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micrograms of a recombined hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine will be administered once a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected under the skin and not injected under the muscle. if you are weakened by the skin and not into the muscle. if you are weakened by a condition or treatment in your body's own body, or if you are subject to a hamdialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Make your doctor if you are taking for any further medicine or if you have been vaccinated if you have been vaccinated if your child has been vaccinated or Immortlobuline (antibodies) was given or she is planned for the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough, and the person is not being protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time by Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the dates that have become known since the issuance of the first approval for the launch, the CHMP has noted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix has been positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix but only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medications are limited to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium-ammonium can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymes or with hypercombustion encephalopathy (Hirnbsp) as a result of a high level of ammonium concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2808">The ammonium of ammonium is divided into several single doses to meals - swallowed or mixed with a gastrockets (through the abdominal blanket in the stomach of leading hose) or a Nasensonde (by the nose in the stomach of the hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparable study, since ammonite children could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite children may also cause appetite loss, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, headache, stimulus, liquid pain, vomiting, nausea, rash, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonite the ammonium of ammonium, in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved under "unusual circumstances," because of the rarity of the illness at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with an all-time enzymes already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delayed form (incomplete enzyme, which manifests itself according to the first life of life) then consists of an indication for the use when in the amity of hyperflavorous encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, children who are not able to swallow as tablets or for patients with sizing dysfunction, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated based on account of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manipulated lack of carnitylactic acid or ornithintranscarfs, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginosuccino synthetase deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with ocketdysfunction, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusula consists of if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium ylhexadyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with a congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium, and eyelet formation can only be applied with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and differentiation of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contracted (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacaca, young rats ate to a high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) to a slowdown of neurons and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of crushed synapses and a reduced number of functioning nervous damage in the brain and thus a disability in the brain death.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected, whether phenylacaca is excreted by humans in breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is generated during a standstill time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS reached at least 56% of patients at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not in connection with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anovic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatacid tin, heavy hypokalia, arytopenia, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdosage occurred with an accidental one dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) during a 5 month old small child.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacaca, which showed an intravenous rate of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosshined neural elasticity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic connection, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine in phenylacetylamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylamin is seen comparable to phenol (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for removal of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for every gram of bias of phenyllabyrite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine nitrogen, can be assumed for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival of survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early slated form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborderage was almost always infectious, and the disease caused by treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stucages within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By herbalysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrous oxide (sodium phenylbutyrite, sodium benzoat, and perhaps substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to raise the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and patients were treated with hyperastercephalopathy before the first appearance of a hypersensitive encephalopathy. the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients with many too mental disabilities or other neurologic deficit.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a delayed form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic deficiency), which were treated by a hypersensitive encephalopathy and followed permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet showed the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficit are hardly reversible with treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is well known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney and glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and uranium used to an empty dose of 5 g of phenylbutyrat on an empty healthy adult and in patients with liver cirrhosis according to individual provisions and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to an intravenous gift by sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacaca.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g of phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurted concentrations of phenylbutyrat have been detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycleic acid or hemoglobin gene, it was detectable in various doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after pressing a phenylacceate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations appear in the plasma brick on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80% in the form of the conjugated phenylacetylamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had been treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat is taken as oral for infants (infants and children, who can't swallow no tablets or patients with sickle problems) or via a gastrockets or a Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arinine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manipulated lack of carnitylactic acid or ornithintranscarfs, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granulat contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium ylhexadyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rapattened before the birth of phenylacaca (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the stag-house.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anovic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatacid tin, heavy hypokalia, arytopenia, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for removal of excess joints.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of researches of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle, it can be assumed for each gram of bias of phenyllabyrite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurologic deficit are hardly reversible with treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">According to an oral single dose of 5 g of phenylbutyrat in granular form, 15 minutes after taking measurted concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the great measuring scoop of 8.6 g of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to get the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, that they cannot be able to put a waste in the body by consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If there are laboratory experiments performed, you need to inform the doctor that you can take AMMONAHP, as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">For taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not a spelling medication.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the standstill time you may not take AMMONAPS since the drug may survive in breast milk and could harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, turbulences, headaches, flavours disorders, reproduction of Gehörs, Destibility, memory, and worsening of existing neurologically states were observed.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar (a form of pain in breast grain) or myocardial infarction (heart failure) without "ST- Hebung" (a abnormal measured value of the electroretinogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to patients in patients that undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue to be continued for up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or cardiac disease in order to contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the sole offering or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots), compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - at the prevention of new events (deaths, heart failures or Revascularisation) after 30 days or one year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected to a PCI, Angiox was as effective in all indicators as heparin, except with severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other stags, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Furthermore, it may not be applied to patients who had a blood circulation, as well as with a strong high blood pressure or a severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use agent (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin at the treatment of ACS and one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to provide a licence for placing the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndication (unstable angina / non - ST-lever)) with an emergency access or when early intervention is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI was conducted in other sequence one PCI, an additional bolts of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolts of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a single intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and efficacy of an allucius gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, should be charged a second boldness of 0.3 mg / kg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be used with a lower accuracy rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second Bolusdose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdose.</seg>

<seg id="2907">In case of PCI-patients with bivaliruddings occur in most bleeding an arterial point, in patients who are subjected to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment in principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated waiting in and treated with Bivalirudin, a surveillance of the INR value (International Standards ratio) should be drawn to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudding in return is achieved prior to the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the impact mechanism of anti-agulancia (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytenant units) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is applied for the treatment of adults, teenagers and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the upper thighs or upper arm, or as continuous as an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the blood or process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lullisin differs very slight from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter efficiencies are more than a short-effective humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been examined in combination with a long-term insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body could not produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">At type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indebator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first clinical study with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was reported compared to a reduction of 0.14% when insulin lislisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% involving human normal standard.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against insulin delivery or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to grant approval from Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, the thigh or of the delta angle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cutting.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin instability, the insulin need can be decreased in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change of the effectiveness, the brand (Her- actor), the insulin intyps (normal, NPH, zelt delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin delivery) and / or manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the onset of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin fee, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic cetoer. these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on the other insulin type or an insulin or any other manufacturer should be under stringent medical supervision, and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycemia depends on the effective profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change at changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Increase the substances that can boost blood glucose concentrations, engiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, Diseases, Fluoxetine, Monoamin-oxidation, fioxifyllin, Propoxyphen, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathies, Clonidin, Guanethin and Reserpin, can be weakened or missing the symptoms of adverted counteracts.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproducizing elasticity showed no differences between intra- solid and human-insulin regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic and fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin lullent occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin doesn't occur in the breast milk above, yet it will be resorded according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trials listed under which adverse reactions are listed (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency on the basis of available).</seg>

<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglyceride with consciousness can be treated with an intramuscularly or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately given person, or as an intravenous gift of Glukosis by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine case for the heavy hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating glucose levels (especially through skeleton muscles and fat) as well as through the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in case of subcutaneous Gaetbe of insulin delivery, the mode of resistance is shorter than with hu- manem standard.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes - TUS showed insulin delivery effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportioned increase of gluing effect, just like humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin islullin has a double as fast action entry like normal humanities and achieves the complete gluing effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than Humanities.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that during an application of insulin lullisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable postdenial glycemic control is achieved as with humaneness that will be given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before the meal, insulin lullisomy was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postdenial control was achieved as with a humaneness that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin delivery is checked in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control will be given as in normal normal conditions that will be given 2 - grooves before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery at a gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN: before beginning of meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin delivery), which was given 30 minutes (normal - 30 minutes) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin delivery that was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lullin at a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN: after onset of a meal in comparison to human norms) that was 2 minutes (normal - before beginning of meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
