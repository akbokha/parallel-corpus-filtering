the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by which these easier available .
further information about the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
in order to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings to set up your settings .... Open the card box tools and select the required modules .
this is a list of standard entry modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that if you have any more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , compiled &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; if you comp@@ ile this package before you comp@@ ile it .
in order to use the crash module , click at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of stor@@ ms , if available , delete .
you can edit the file filter ( also folder ) in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras view filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory on different types .
to use the DO@@ M building view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; this is a new window with the DO@@ M which has just displayed page . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ate , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type I@@ ode / directory by local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; fs@@ wald ; is it , the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sting structures . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of the sub @-@ sub objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ wald ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in this way . according to that , you can easily be detected in the folder hier@@ archy . according to that , &amp; fs@@ view can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ wald ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation , have the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaning@@ fully color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle that is switched over colour mode can either display depth for the slight detection of the casing pipe or the picture of a different file size such as name , owners , group or MI@@ ME @-@ type .
a rectangle can be used with the various features of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can define it , only if enough space is present on display or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and therefore , there may be the relative position of the label in the rectangle below ) .
at Dar@@ em@@ ap algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be kept proportional to the size of the entry . during the tre@@ ach@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always adher@@ ed to , and that frames must be no longer available . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square .
how to split the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate text , the implementation is left unt@@ rue . here it is more advant@@ ageous to make sure that rec@@ tan@@ gles is created so that rec@@ tan@@ gles whether the best methods are square . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or recru@@ itment problems .
you can design@@ ate the minimum cover area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the or@@ derly entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an opposing entry .
originally &amp; fs@@ wald was originally intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . of course every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . includes a fast image processing with basic training equipment . you can use them to copy and correct your photos . processing capacities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC @-@ color wounded - work@@ flow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of En@@ dan@@ wen@@ s . they should therefore notify problems and improvement .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver was trying to make sense of problems as possible for them . if you are in the program , the help menu contains one entry problems or wishes . if you are using this link , your web browser opens a page in the error report . all required information are already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; is a project which is supported by a community . so if you come to join a regular user from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you are interested to answer any other users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; and hop@@ efully you would like to answer any other user questions . however , in this ma@@ iling list , however , you should be powerful .
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ ver ; homepage to get news about free versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; registration is in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions to log in the developer @-@ mail list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
when you start &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , you will be asked where you want to specify your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folders . specify a file name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data sheet is stored . this path remains the same for all image files .
later you can add a lot of folders like you want to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ve library . settings of di@@ gi@@ on to set up collections .
if you already have a photo collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images provided as base folder . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; viewed every sub @-@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search for the folder you will receive a progress indicator like this :
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; dur@@ ations come out to the libr@@ arian in its whole depth . you can choose no sub@@ folders , unless it is hidden in hidden files . you can then finish in an outside folder and add a point in front of the name of the ch@@ ord .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in my Al@@ um@@ ber will not have photos as symbols . you can change it by using a popular photo from the album and that it will be used as an album symbol . more details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder you can set up in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; you should learn your digital camera . after that you should learn how to manage my albums and my key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera so you can find out . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you need to figure out what a special camera is supported , you &apos;ll find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw materials .
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . of course every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . uses the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has an constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transfers through serial port is slow . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 . you will find a complete list of supported cameras below this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be read with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , the precau@@ tion can be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera channels , if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you could see any look , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ va , is how easy the functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Project Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to put up the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . by writing a small module to complement one function , when the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; even to carry out .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page models with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and cover images works everywhere : you can install a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another use window . the only limitation is this one image not contained in key@@ words , file list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movi@@ es and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields , which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so the fil@@ tering on the fil@@ en@@ ames only works if this ind view can be displayed . which fields will be displayed in the dialog for the Al@@ ben@@ ign .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . these albums were stored in a single Alb@@ umb@@ nail . these albums were stored in a single album , according to the name of their collection , in which the album was created first , in which the album can be changed first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .

what is a digital state administration - apart from the fashion view ? as part of the process , after the image has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos receive , sc@@ aled or digital photographs run a form of digital stock administration . however , most of us do not make this in systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips such as you can back , protecting and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photograph@@ ers which you can find , remove , convert , evaluate , backup , sti@@ ve , waiting , wait , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , search@@ able , con@@ ected , con@@ ferred , and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is in accordance with your definition data that are information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I can claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not know &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you do not know how many pictures you have , then you do not use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . so , the approach to store met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed very fast search and secure archive on which you can freely connect with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you need to maintain any thing into your system . your image files must be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether others want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network operator &amp; etc . note that you have to change it sometime to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found via your location . if you have enough photos , you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of the archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files do together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acks easier . separate new files of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or an initiated picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option on the site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC @-@ data can be found in the file . if you forget it , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to select the corresponding item in the menu album .
you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? for this purpose a met@@ ad@@ ata editor is available for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , since you should now select every photo key@@ words , labelling and assessment . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute . they start the best with the evaluation or the ranking . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now take key@@ words , key@@ words , as you are often called on other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with embedded key@@ words , then the tree will insert the images to the right spot . the changed key@@ words inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified key@@ words are being pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; updated while the sub@@ trees pursu@@ es .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the words - the next section refers to PA or comments , the third major tool to cat@@ ize your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to see most ni@@ em@@ y your photos simply only , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are safe interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . when you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing station of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed their perception of this panoramic position .
for other those pictures , the title is possibly more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you are showing images , it &apos;s the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help him about the motif that you can understand what you understand .
it is OK . if a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only with one label for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , you can also expos@@ e a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can use it for a selection of images . if you want to export your images in web galleries , you will need to tell you the story so for the opening of a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find in a different city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth Earth ? good , because with pictures , the train is driving the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can be extended already in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily exp@@ orting your travel with ge@@ o Earth . you can also export the pictures at the recording place . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also applicable in any modified versions , thus also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information on the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; information should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photograph@@ ers , for example , if it is not desired to protect the identity of photograph@@ ers , then the name of a company or organisation can &apos;t be changed . after that , it should not be changed once . this field does not support Com@@ mas or Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a divi@@ ding character .
Aut@@ oc@@ ation ( Syn@@ onym for Dis@@ asser@@ tion ) : is associated with the author . this field contains the work drawing of photograph@@ ers . examples of this study can be title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the car field , this also must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify the picture . this must not necessarily be the author . if the picture is working here as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / Agency will be given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse , or change it . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important against it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in the near future we will present such a module for forkli@@ fts .
topics : plate errors , turn@@ outs , electric power , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same as you can also happen at traditional paper photos or Neg@@ ative . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery in the world , has some interesting statistics what causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs that you need to fight it more than a few years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . of course you can also download CDs and DVDs . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you think this is in your measurement space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be dis@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording applications and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . therefore it turns to the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able to protect themselves , even if you just have just been written . therefore , they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we require for the form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they need them by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but also similar applications are not available for Mac@@ s . there is also similar applications that read the damaged data of damaged disk drives , hard drives , flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs are also applied to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device in a non @-@ quality media . read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then place on a clean , dark dry and protected site protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of media or software to read this media or software .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . your manufacturer has guaranteed a new disk , but not the data . Google is available to this topic a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
in brief , Dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature differences , the most common troub@@ les@@ ho@@ ists are dis@@ able . these are especially reading errors and deposits . these are especially reading errors and deposits . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
here is the complete loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also handle data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses are usually again made without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electrical equipment , these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious loss of data loss , hardware fail@@ ures , destro@@ ying mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the inev@@ itable time to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy storage absor@@ bs and the rest . it is normally made in the form of a wall bar . remember , however , it is not an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning and thereby protects the properly connected devices .
since a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also consider that even all peripher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage supplies which can also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
when you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the road .
while an over@@ voltage protection of your system can be used for smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will help you to result in a complete loss . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting pre@@ st@@ resses , these devices can provide automatic battery energy when a power failure . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and automatically work up to the current . if you have a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current problems with costs for avoi@@ ding these . a high quality voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you are aware of your computer . at the end , you should always remember all cables to connect before you drive to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as the drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any quantity of data .
compared to the hard drives , it is very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore only suited as solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will provide online memory services on photos stored on photos . your free variant is available to you for more than $ 25 per year . you will receive unlimited storage in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r . for $ 25 a year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large firms in the offer a backup and a partial memory . so they are Des@@ ired .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transmis@@ sions are due to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integral between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when it happened in your hardware . all these dis@@ rup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought to have thought . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission ratio as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not concerned about transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates to be able to handle and scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the workplace systems . in case of not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks it is already the proportion of theft .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most chis@@ els . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; so far no longer have been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file system . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems avoid corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during a surgery is higher and a non @-@ defined status is avoided before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 @-@ stop settings of fundamental physical borders . there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution already has to deteri@@ or@@ ated . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apixel and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive provides you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not get any other data loss for data loss . so you get your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing the exchange of records or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you have to make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you have happiness when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster strike locally , and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ els are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ a always means a local store . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a loss of data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , which is not available immediately , you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generate a full snap@@ shot at two points : to the complete assurance and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . generate several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only handled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily copied to your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that really have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure an important pictures directly after you &apos;ve saved them on your computer on a DVD or a different visual media .
this approach will give you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional lesson should be done manually after which you have made a complete verification .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , associated X@@ MP files , original store , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet .
this valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be looked at :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature it is said to be careful and re @-@ rate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to use as the current system back@@ wards . the less variants are in the past , the more easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explan@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your image , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you want your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and you need to convert your library if necessary , please stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional printing process for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually a bit larger .
let us assume that you have already planning the scal@@ ability with a dedicated disk or partition . in * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record :
verify the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollars ; dd / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of the plate in MB@@ O ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there &apos;s no software any software you can read it , then you can create these themselves . this task becomes easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it &apos;s fun free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC @-@ data for an improved color instruction for h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous platforms , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs and does not have a slow compression . this format will we recommend to store your images .
T@@ IFF was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed format or stored in a container with a fun free compression compression . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted for many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope that the competitors can use Canon and Nikon also sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why to replace Adobe his XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a blend of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers pull it off the original of your recording , mostly in the raw file format . but it can come to problems when linking the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and as above mentioned above , you should remember whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ met@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI co @-@ communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ figured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera ri@@ dium , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your Roh@@ an@@ v . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata back . these were cut off under circumstances among other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in section adding a photos to an album you can add a description , as you can already add to your hard drive . but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ Bank .
in order to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; simply connect this with the machine , switch the camera on the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , the fil@@ en@@ ames will appear at the bottom and the preview photos of all photos on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for any file , photos , movies , music , etc on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need camera information on each entry . you can see the features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single entry or the met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information are available .
the Rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar in the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then choose the selection from all . this invites all the pictures from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . when downloading , pictures are not deleted , before you delete pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; if you have chosen the photos , please use the button to download and then select the chosen button . the button has chosen as long as you have chosen some photos .
when your camera supports this , a new option is available . these pictures have not yet been selected by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the buttons all download or chosen ones , a dialog will appear in which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will be shown in section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; invites the pictures from the camera to the album .
as soon as you have downloaded the required photos , you can er@@ ase them from the camera . you can delete all on once , then you need to delete the button , then you need to select it first and delete the delete chosen .
please note that there are no possibility to restore the photos taken from the camera . you should fully verify that the photos were successfully extingu@@ ished in one &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you want to delete them completely in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you want to delete it from camera , you should make it more about the camera stream because this is much faster .
cameras do not use a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently . the fil@@ en@@ ames will normally be recycled after the photos taken from the camera . therefore it can be useful when you need photos of various adv@@ ancements in the same album . therefore it can be useful , the date and the time that the picture was made to in@@ corporate the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the picture and for data @-@ based sub@@ woo@@ fers . if you use this latter option , automatically create a folder per day .
the options on the transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the pictures are stored on the plate . if you choose this , the corresponding entries are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another file format as the standard format format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M + % . turn the option date &amp; time add . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the option to modify the file names in small letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ame name , den &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; for a photo using it will display the camera in the preview window . your settings are stored and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to do so . not all cameras put this information ready . in the section side@@ bar you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the picture in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button and choose the automatic turning in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been downloaded from the date at which the picture has been made available , you can use it . all the pictures are loaded in the same album . not all cameras set this information available . in section Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off and in this case you save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to switch this option on and choose the option date based on the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . then choose the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; you , where the pictures are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera is out . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . it is a position that can be shown in long@@ itude and latitude . the determination of the data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to combine an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane in order to carto@@ graphi@@ cally an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten us where the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . users wish to document the site of the photos , or simply select this aspect , it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is how the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exotic 2 many GPS data fields are available ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ o assignment ( manual ) and last@@ ly on the manual input of known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
you can download the GPS data from one device with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you need to store these data in the GP@@ X format since this is the only format which is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the express tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ fix coordinates to be created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in french , german and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; trying to give you much control of his work processes as possible . there are many settings that enter the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . to set up on these settings , you must select between these settings . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
you can select the embedded preview or image processing can be started on the embedded preview . set the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard di@@ cul@@ acy and ur@@ ber@@ ation data . these data will be automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option has been selected when downloading from the camera interface . this data is also written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Auto@@ ort@@ results is a syn@@ onym for the author of Dis@@ asser@@ tion : this field should contain the professional drawing of photograph@@ ers . this can be drawings such as employed photographer , freelance photographer , or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author box , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate the photo . this must not be the author , then these organizations should be registered here since this picture is a storage picture , then the group or Agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions run the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the picture , and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; . these met@@ ad@@ ata have also available other programs and can be imported and can be imported without lost .
image labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you can add to your photos , which can also be read from other illustrated pictures . attention : in images that are already pre @-@ contained , they will be over@@ written by those of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants .
the page settings contains all options for the information that rests on the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is indicated or not .
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ver ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; you may want to add the file extensions to this list ; Alb@@ um@@ my Fol@@ ders , which has no such extensions , are ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
you can re @-@ press the default settings , press the button on your right from any category .
the settings of the lumin@@ osity of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; if you can open the light table , these settings can be switched on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode then you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better performance results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color you can select it here . you can use the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over and over@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or light colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Ch@@ ro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images will be coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , because P@@ NG requires more time to trigger and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can bet this value to a high compression , meaning 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
using the T@@ IFF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no effect on image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free .
with the adjustment free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can choose fun freely . even if you wrote the loss of loss of quality , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , the met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it &apos;s very fast to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ ti@@ ce pattern with V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white is equal to the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic ink balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not placed . default , it is a fixed color balance which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras , with the effect of the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors has the effect to get more detail in four steps more detail in the top speed . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your camera can begin to consider as transparent white in the settings . at least , use the att@@ itudes within several ro@@ ub@@ es . at last , you can try some parts of missing information from the top speed .
this is possible because the blue pixels generally does not satisfy so fast as green and red . and d@@ oping are therefore trying to construct the missing green and red proportions of the still not saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , select the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually to each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you will probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . to keep the time for the demo version , you should be conservative .
a demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub@@ tra@@ verse image sensor which have many cameras and which provide a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; and D@@ cra@@ w will provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it looks so as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm of the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result .
if you know the colour deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour conversion , as you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these are to be given . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . information like the color information from a colour space to survive in the other means that colors are as accurate as possible .
if a picture in image processing is opened / color scheme module with raw files .
color Profile folder S@@ connect to the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / color / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . then these folders are examined during the start .
settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility to deposit &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can change later when opening the shell file later .
the photographs of the color view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your images and are not the full screen .
the input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you do not fit . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain d@@ m@@ apping or gam@@ ma@@ correct correction . currently , the cra@@ w@@ m@@ apping is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bits depth . this means that you have to carry out the color @-@ m@@ apping himself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be given by a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer .
it is quite evident for most cameras it is quite evident which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , there is not a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon Profile expansion can be seen the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the Standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing methods ; many modules support , which have been written to work with each program which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you can see a list of available modules . if you want to use it , and these will then be loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ f . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . see also in the context menu of the lecture menu .
short @-@ commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short @-@ commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project on h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org , or in the manual books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image cro@@ s@@ sings , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other turn@@ out fields switch to the met@@ ad@@ ata or that ends at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left . on the right side , a button Autom@@ atically detect a camera which is tried to identify the camera correctly . if you are using this , make sure that the camera is properly connected to the computer screen . currently , serial port , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are supported .
at the bottom of the end you can use the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have an USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or so , when you hang up your camera .
in order to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , you need to connect the camera with your computer , set it in the display mode and switch on .
try out whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver comes ; the camera automatically recogn@@ ises the camera . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will appear in the menu &apos;s cameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here .
using the option dialog for shifting of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can adjust the talk of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; when del@@ etion of a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ etion of an album you will find more details .
editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ it by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the modifications .
you can also read the display of the welcome screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ on ; starting with start@@ up . this accelerates from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver under circumstances .
the setting should look for new photos when searching for new photos taken to look after new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if something from the base folder was deleted , you ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver if it is supposed to delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; used to select the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to the correction and improving . image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of a picture or by the menu item menu / Edit menu / Edit menu .
the photo editing includes a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . so you are under certain circumstances . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the image processing .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the processing functions of photo editing are changing your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo , before you use the store , save the button from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should make a copy of your image before you can change it . you can store it with Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the picture , you can restore the original picture to restore deleted from the File menu . you lose any change in the tool@@ bar you will lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last promotion can be revers@@ ed by clicking on the reverse and to restore deleted from the menu .
if you are often using this , you should make the short@@ cut short , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ Alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a context menu in the tool@@ bar at a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also made , or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between pictures in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , image high , image low or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will ask if you want to save it .
you can in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . they come to the normal view , where you do not want to use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to change this in the creation dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ver . you can call it out of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; to view this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print it in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer . if you follow the assist@@ ants you need to make your choice only .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , the important information and actions available for the selected images . the same page bar is available without navigation use , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders are attached :
multiple Click on the same rider &apos;s side@@ bar will appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the label view , you can insert a label with unlimited size or insert it . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ s fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and are converted to special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ label in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you comment on , you can either use the button or switch to the next picture , the labelling will then be saved .
besides the user knob there is a button . with this you can read other met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setup , which is always written in the pictures .
the section evaluation shows a assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and sor@@ rows . it can always be applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for the words of key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; session @-@ made key@@ words .
the Key@@ word tree is adapted to the entered search word . you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering in a photo series . if you have entered different key@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
key@@ words can also be set by selecting the respective check boxes in the tree . all key@@ words of one image will be stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the higher image and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ words and su@@ chan@@ ts . if additionally one or more key@@ word filter from the right side will be used , only the cut quantity of these two are available .
you can also pull key@@ words and cover them . if the key@@ word exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put them on the selection . as a result , you will ask if you want to make the key@@ word .
in the example above , the main window shows the pictures at one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is based on a calendar day . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right voice tree was drawn up and put there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . you can also be switched on settings .
if you have a rule with and created a rule and notice that it should be one or his , you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is looking for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
you can select a Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . see the options as follows :
why does Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r have not been listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly changed &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; s more concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ administered work@@ flow , you can reach a predic@@ table deviation from the different camera or scanner . with a color @-@ administered work@@ flow you can reach that colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that represent the colors you publish or in the web with them from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme is coming on color , then everyone wants to express what buttons it must express for the results that he would like to ask for the results of image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information and make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions .
if your picture work@@ flow meets all six criteria listed below , you must not care for colour management .
you can work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other topics are per e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy why you should then use another colour space and make sure that thoughts do not have to do more about colour .
a visual example of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors we can see below will be presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ b @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lind@@ sey this page and click on info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ R@@ GB color space or not , you must work your monitor k@@ alli@@ on , because s@@ R@@ GB is based on the monitor . if you work as in colour space of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve an image in most cases . use it before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , final , automatic and contrast from the menu of Cor@@ rig@@ ate automatic correction , try automatically to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see what acts at your photo .
norm@@ alize the method : this method sc@@ aled the whole image , so that the dark point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same method : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of the image is achieved . sometimes , the same very good results achieved by improving the contra@@ sts of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders at a picture or destroyed it .
automated : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it det@@ ects the dark and bright mar@@ g@@ inal shades and adjust the red , green and blue channels onto the complete hist@@ o range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of R@@ GB values of a picture by the move of the lowest and highest values on the highest possible range and a new ji@@ re@@ ation of all values . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver comes ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform white and white .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited since a colour space is working with 8 @-@ bit per color . in case you can perform the white inside of the original mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your options will be better for correction .
this tool is based on a Weiß@@ er equivalent of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it via the menu entry colors white and equal to the image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the tool@@ bar . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness , then click the picture window to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is indicated as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right is shown a hist@@ ogram , once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , saturation and Gamma . the shade adjust the shadow details of your photos or even down down .
controlling An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then directly on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white comparison . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white image with the pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed dict@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel over@@ exposed . you will display the combined result in white . this is displayed as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of the white image you can set you to store a text file and then load again later .
the default button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white image . note that there will also be neutral settings like your original . if you store it , your original picture is changed .
you can set the coefficients of coefficients per color channel of the processed images . 8 @-@ bit code is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images . however , this coding requires more record field , data time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets range . detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be deduc@@ ted from the chapter on color .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors pitch . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust the same bug and allows you to adjust these for multiple photos . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner will always need the same error and you will always require the same correction . in the hand@@ book on the pitch file , you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct problems is the tool to Gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver has four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar energy , even Sab@@ ati@@ er was called , a effect of the image provided by a partially developed pressure . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar radiation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what it is possible . another increase is generated by a negative image that is not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect to the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it is emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reconstructed color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and this is a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly offers saturated colours , but also some of them photograph@@ ers , especially those which are barely terra@@ ced landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ Filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter levels controls the brightness of the results and the sli@@ der to the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large pictures , the filter can take the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your Just@@ ices can be viewed in the preview menu . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you have a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem . even in this case , the tool is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ stärke / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the use of use only the area of sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a gradient of intensity levels , a hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected range . under the Gra@@ ph , three sli@@ ders can be clicked onto the image , the left side represents the dark ones and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the controller and changes it on how the picture changes .
the original and preview of the picture can be viewed on the right hand side . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , on the basis of the picture , on the left side , the following options are available .
angel@@ ing : using this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color , the linear history is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three knob : the upper@@ most layer for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lower sounds , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three paint twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two types that can be used to change the output values like in the input . the compression of the output values can be used for example , for example , to create a light image as background while something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image data will be automatically set depending on the values of the image .
store and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and later re@@ loaded , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color keys , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun . if you want to use and click the preview of the original image for red , green , blue , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees .
the option of over@@ exposed dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to view over over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final results .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , the half of the original and the target picture will be displayed , depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modifications channel : this select box allows to address the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are changing between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the linear mode of the sens@@ ory colour is produced . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
if you move a short @-@ valve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that this bright tone can correspond with dar@@ ker mani@@ folds and that can be dar@@ ker by the corresponding pixel pixel .
on the preview of original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
store and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve which you can have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p spa format .
if you want to create this method and the three color keys automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun . select the paint pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve .
this option is controlled by over@@ exposed pixels , to view over over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . here you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final results .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ as . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays was placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the original ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color cre@@ ations of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors channel @-@ mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you an initial hint like you can correct the relative distribution and impact . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as a comparison of the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you can position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are also able to enable L@@ umin@@ rom , as the channel bl@@ ender is able to reduce this channel mixer for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color becomes a visible noise that comes from the colour space which does not occur at the same place in the color channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion rapidly in which you reduce the color .
save and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer settings can store it for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposed dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to view over over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final results .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the finished picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your absur@@ dity . with the development of digital photography it is black / white , as colour images simply can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to Portra@@ its against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure with a orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange .
Rot@@ ate Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure with a red lens filter . this created dramatic cel@@ ain @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ eness to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the natural shade correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones as a bit cold in the cas@@ ings . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and recovery in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
decorate with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , texture texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture with image processing can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and thre@@ es@@ cent of the texture on the image .
a paper texture is applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the change was changed under ( 2 ) and the original relief model has been set to 200 .
to add &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver the tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . to keep his attention , it is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired type of frame for your image . the image is covered with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , wi@@ k@@ ant@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button and decorative stone frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have to cut the tool according to aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any point . this is also possible at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use text orientation , orientation , color , colour space and character set . the bigger the picture , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame about the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting which you have chosen for your text may be changed until you click &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
you can apply a template on a template with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . template templates can be put on a template .
the menu image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates via a picture .
for the template there is no limitations on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should then send a template on the template &apos;s size . if you want your template of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , simply send an email to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ ver @-@ U@@ sers @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder for the templates was set out a building view , which reflects the folder structure of the template . the selection of a folder update automatically the templates of templates .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the dar@@ nel picture . it is cent@@ ered for the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this knob resi@@ sts in the underlying picture . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you &apos;ll need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this knob to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . take the image and put it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template on your image . the image is then adapted to the preview size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; sets three different tools for ho@@ oting . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ins images .
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ k . actually it can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Winston Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ ting .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution must be put together to a common color . this is , however , the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has been applied to internal pain . images in the raw material must always be sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ated during processing .
some scanner apply a scra@@ pping filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing mar@@ ke@@ a suit . you can call by the menu entry by the menu entry .
you should point out carefully , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , you will find it about the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate re@@ focus . under re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it . use the tool to sof@@ ter with the menu entry basket and experiment something with Settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the picture . the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two key parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase of the radius or amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask to make the effect , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed images at its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the s@@ wis@@ ely image that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a break@@ out of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . you can therefore define a minimal difference between the sounds of shar@@ pen@@ ed and therefore beauti@@ es faul@@ ts , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ ge @-@ protected m@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on . this is better approach than just to try the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtration . re@@ focus is usually better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focus on colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ le works much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ oun@@ tain , which is a very long tail , which is far away from the source cover , which is far from the original qu@@ icker pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is influenced by the distant pixels , which causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ ed . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can make a higher value if your image is very in@@ sharp , but then on Heilig@@ en@@ sch@@ a .
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the def@@ ending effect of the module .
volume filters : an increase in the cat@@ ch@@ filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 but rarely helpful . if the sound filter is very poor . however , 0 is the image quality very poor . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will not even so@@ iling the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this is most often used by one before in@@ sharp@@ ness filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ facts , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / oder@@ den cra@@ cks .
matter size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , if you choose large values for circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s edge . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range from 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus will be set for you so that it is stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions to the image before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible , but they left un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts .
if you are reading pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module on the un@@ compressed image .
in general , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produces better result than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by this , un@@ sharp mas@@ cot uses a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theo@@ reti@@ cally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks must always produce ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never indicate the effect of visual filters . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters can always be at least as good as the im@@ pregn@@ ation mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original bright color image has to be corrected . this image has been done with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods to be used in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob increases the im@@ pregn@@ ation of the area being dar@@ kened to create a natural more natural pair .
the color@@ fully enables the adjusted color for pupils . if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented levels .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab displays and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even higher values , mainly homogen@@ eous region smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should get more details so that no weak@@ ens need to be subsequently established . please note that the details of the detail pane should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction dep@@ en@@ dency alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD smoke , a high value of wave @-@ like patterns will produce . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts are being eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum gain factor above all . p defines the relative gain . set this value therefore matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter represents bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is estimated if it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ ist effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : is how often the algorithm is gone through . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step 1 &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen , should be also small . please ensure that small angles do not generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose the value for so size and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rative stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixels . you should place the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels G@@ lue and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality which you will receive by selecting this option is only low . but it doubles the term . we therefore recommend it .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . any setting of image errors may be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how picture errors are made with small ar@@ te@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with a film camera . as you see , there are a unique black film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; rough@@ ness is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging noise . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is available for selected image filters to remove st@@ ains and other ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust and hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion shows ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor slides of digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial first .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene developed with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ screen settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is required for the filter . large values increase the time specified by the filter per pixel and allows the image to be moved on the picture and the color in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and thus smaller error occurred .
sharp@@ ness : controls the threshold level . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front . if it is increased , smo@@ oth@@ ed filter must be reset . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture data can no longer receive and cra@@ b or dirt occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can be removed or smo@@ oth@@ tips . use it at a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ants of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process of the details shown by the details settings .
colour : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ones , which typically increases stronger . it also pol@@ ishes the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it &apos;s too high , smo@@ oth@@ ness can occur at the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction that you set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how to change noise reduction in your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the original correction was applied with ( 2 ) and the volume reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture to draw for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen , use the menu entry with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of the operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools for photo@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filters for rest@@ or@@ ations gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desirable ar@@ te@@ facts , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sors and local faul@@ ts that occurs in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ ised images , which makes the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the text is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm to restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ d. and is part of C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression compression , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards are described in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ ration can now be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo rest@@ or@@ ations is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can be restored like a photo with equal noise . the module will be applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo rest@@ or@@ ations . this time Tex@@ tures were able to see an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that have been viewed by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver Bo@@ xes . the hot@@ size is allowed by using a CCD camera with a CCD camera . it is used to remove algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels represent a problem , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in supp@@ ression technology for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to select &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ tra@@ cting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
Download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button dark . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the proper dark image to correct image . please note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads this in the next session .
the image area and the preview can be corrected to you within the image . the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all of view areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : there is an average of the neighbouring pixel size . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels of the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels of the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less then moved to calculate a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , used . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correct correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , you can &apos;t even reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses show also this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use the center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects are created through motion .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and film @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter and it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter . this tool is used by a Cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three rules , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correct correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which means an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or randomly compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reducing it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ stärke , contrast and Gamma @-@ Settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correct adjustment decreases the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the accuracy of the target using these options . the knob will provide you only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver menu . image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correct correction of a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct image in the corners and ( 2 ) corrected the correct image . a leu@@ kins and contra@@ diction was also performed at the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treated with general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ wit@@ ch form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar con@@ effect , but fl@@ atter on the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient fourth gradient is corrected the removed corners to the second gradient . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second Gra@@ des . with negative values , metric values can be corrected in bat@@ ches and positive values in vertical distortion .
a corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of Gra@@ des . this value acts stronger than the edges in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter specifies the sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby introduces the correction of the first gradient . enlarge the negative values while reducing the image .
bright : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated by the dialog with a preview the distortion correct . the values you are using for your image are stored and used as the default values for the next start .
the metric tons and pressure @-@ shaped correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as all the first . if you are able to cut a picture and then carry a metric tons of correction would be the effect of the counter@@ act .
to help you make the best correction to show you this tool in view of the dot@@ ted lines . move it into an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site . in connection , you can correct the metric tons / k@@ is@@ ular distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a k@@ is@@ ite distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can cut them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of the dialog .
for most pictures , the number of tons is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs like pictures from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the metric tons of correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ vacc@@ gur@@ u.@@ org web@@ page . filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film sub@@ gra@@ ins and film sensitivity . the ISO knob increases the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter is used to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply to black / white photos , as the color information are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ infr@@ a @-@ red film photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the advanced .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . filter film@@ maker is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ven images such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturers large silver gra@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ulsion .
the effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you like this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ding picture specifically in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is even though higher values need to be set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film production efficiency on a black / W picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the model worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a char@@ tered @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two knob to affect the effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited to large images . smooth or , from the other side are considered , the arti@@ fic@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the reference is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and G@@ ov@@ te 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , filter charcoal drawing is used for colour and intensity gra@@ dients . the images whose gradient are slowly changing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you could imagine what scene you could have chosen to outline . that would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; filter engra@@ ver has shaped your image in 3 @-@ D when it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing in the content . filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering process . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork by distortion effects . it is used by copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells , and makes it look like whether it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects anytime with the button .
using this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork with visual effects . it is also used by copyright algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image along with glob@@ ular lines . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sch@@ sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ ely the image by rotating the pixels by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ ely the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera st@@ in@@ ese . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ ely the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a linear moving , z : B : by a car or train photographer , camera .
soft@@ ly visual acuity : s@@ wis@@ ely the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ed light .
Schüt@@ z in@@ sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ ely the image due to acci@@ dental displacement of pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a arbit@@ r@@ ary camera .
intelligent Un@@ vis@@ ing : find the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the image and s@@ wis@@ ely them to change these without the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore end this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ops are a nice little tool to make a drop @-@ drop down to your image . therefore it gives natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
drop size allowed it to change the size of the image . since the dri@@ p size is not automatic with the size of the image , it often does not need to reduce the size and density of the drops . fish change changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can do with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing a range free of reg@@ ression . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face which will remain free . if you start the filter drop @-@ drop , the area will remain free of reg@@ ression .
this is an example of a drop @-@ drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset by a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transformation and transform@@ ations mirror .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
an image to be smaller is simple . the great question is how you can find a picture of sound and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information here or err@@ ates ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , makes a good job . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can sc@@ aled it to the size size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to sound .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation of a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo shooting was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are mentioned below :
retain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio will retain the aspect ratio of the original aspect ratio .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter represents bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is estimated if it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ ist effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and shop will be used exactly . any setting for photo enlarge it can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo shooting is very fast in what it makes , but it can take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below a sample for photo shooting as a small colour picture was increased to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear default magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not just a normal operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo , you just need to cut the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse and move the rectangle below . you will see this rectangle below while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . this way you will get a good overview like your photo after cutting . you can drag the size of the rectangle to cut off at the corners of the rectangle . you can easily create a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting edge button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and the width is assigned .
the tool is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ meter or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons on the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
below in the dialog , you can use the maximum ratio button to cut the area to the size possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool follows according to aspect ratios ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the tool bar , these settings are stored as standard values in dependence on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected in the cut @-@ up image and not the original image .
the settings of coll@@ ation aid permit help enable Help to put together your images better . these Help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles with the diagonal to divide the diagonal .
golden Mid : the golden middle is a division which shows on various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ el or the bl@@ ender leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we can feel beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the old Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times if you merge your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i succession 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 13 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . if each number is equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre provides liquid supply lines if you are using a picture . these Help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring your goal good results for your photos . compared to third party , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a sym@@ metric view on this type .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden spiral @-@ corner . this rec@@ tan@@ gles is used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line of his or different objects . this somewhat can be simply because of the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles also der@@ ive from the top parts of the golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are not equal to equal triangles . diagonal to these lines can place a static object .
if you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame , you create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and the vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are rotated by an angle . you can repair it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select trans@@ forming free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are shown in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
to help your help the module allows a horizontal and vertical line to positioning the two lines . after you have moved it with a pressure on the left mouse button you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transformation from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic and cut the function automatic . select one of the following options :
an option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing smo@@ oth@@ es the picture a bit after turning . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tively transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angles left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angles left : shows the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right below : shows the current angle in degrees to the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture will be a little contam@@ inated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have changed the perspective , you have un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . the possibility to ber@@ some is the picture with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer .
shave your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pre@@ ferences , the angle will be shown to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown on the right of the preview pane .
at your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse at an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the stress , the picture will be a bit confused . for a single shooter , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two lab@@ ings are produced twice as much , and therefore you should avoid that .
after placing the image , the image has in@@ tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to remove them is the image with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write it from your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you become a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
due to the dep@@ en@@ dency of other libraries it is impossible to present a list of all file formats in this place . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . however , only files in formats are known . this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can modify this list of file extensions . you can find more information in section configuration .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ va , support both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw converted converter from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , assisted in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , which is included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . now , more than 200 raw file formats supported . all support cameras can be seen on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of commod@@ ity forms which came by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
many digital cameras supported the recording short films . these clips are often saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but if you click on a film file and then does not have any built @-@ in options to show or edit . if you click on a film file &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use the program to play playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth Earth .
if you are taking steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well , if the original contrast has already been very good , you can perform the first four Just@@ ices with the Module white .
many tools that do you need the photo editing are contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , sc@@ ur@@ anium , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect on the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ li@@ quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress indicator shows the status of the filter to the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison list of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected preview pane .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter to the range below the selected preview pane .
the left section shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divided . the upper section shows the original and the lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview range and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and exposure . the un@@ used colors can be adapted in the general assembly site .
( 3 ) The frame for selecting the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the picture and put it on the part of the picture , which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the left side of the left : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely expla@@ ining . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters on the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data , when these are available .
this rider puts an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move around a square . press all the images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this suggests that your pictures are contained in ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ; is a editor for pallets files . the application can be used to work of color pal@@ ettes and the use of colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and name used color .
in the dialog pallet you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the files according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as line as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the colour is described under the pallet screen . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to choose such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with the left mouse button .
if the check box is enabled at cur@@ sor under the button color , the color will be inserted either or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by clicking the check box below at the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions , cut off and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ; used the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color sets three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ line characters , if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ;
the colors in the palette and output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find the color on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . graph@@ s are available in science , especially in science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GU@@ I ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . so far , there was no modern &amp; GU@@ I program ; it has been revealed by Gra@@ ph . software programs , or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by modern and user @-@ friendly graphic user with all the functions of an integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; graph@@ ed viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ phs . graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ite ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of an integrated &amp; kiss ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GU@@ I ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that an amendment to Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the Gra@@ ph newly calculated and in &amp; graph@@ ite ; represents )
menu to open the Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; open or to open the Gra@@ ph in &amp; graph@@ ite ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
load large gra@@ phen ( at present there are problems with approximately 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to depic@@ t more than these no@@ des )
other necessary software : &amp; graph@@ ed viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ er ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of gra@@ phen needs to be needed in detail :
the main window shows the open Gra@@ ph , each in a separate window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without a argument , the main window contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Zul@@ u opened files . Click on the first icon to view the dialog box .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot @-@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if Gra@@ ph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or choose this position automatically .
use the mouse ( high and low without special keys , left and right near pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you will see the maximum reduction of a gradient .
when the audio viewer &apos;s straight and graphic viewer ; changed file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change , or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can also change your decision later , you can also use the menu item settings like , see also , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite outside of a current &amp; graphic viewer ; please open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or want to display the n@@ ating Gra@@ ph in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can permanently store your choice but also with the setup dialog .
when program start , you can re@@ open all the graph of your last session . once again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be split into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the Gra@@ ph , which should be fit onto this page . however , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be completed by the respective part of Gra@@ ph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
once again , the site has the possibility to define the behaviour if a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behaviour ( automatically rest@@ loading or to ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the page opening is the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; saf@@ graphic records . you can define a standard behaviour in this case ( the Gra@@ ph in a new window or specify in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the page seat management are the possibility to define the starting behavior of &amp; graph@@ ite ; you can open a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you want to check in each start .
the context menu , which normally appears in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ O window , opens up further options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; select entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data to your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization of Kor@@ ut . this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window , and then call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation with GP@@ X file , you &apos;ll need to upload a track file with GP@@ X file , and this file contains data from the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and hence the camera time should be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
setting for the maximum deviation period specifies an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the deviation among them are led together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from a place for images , you can process the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS is , you can put this limits here and press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos taken on the same place . since the dialog you will need to use the coordinates of a button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . if you have always reached the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are options to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a photo gallery of HTML pages . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 encoding the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders on which the settings can be adapted . the albums are allowed to select all albums on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area among them , the alt@@ ben@@ au look and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab is largely self @-@ expla@@ ining . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard view , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to add a basic gallery . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ash@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slide show . this module allows you to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that will be packaged in the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can start the module with ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then printed under picture files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting to the list or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the different settings . if you &apos;re using the video format to be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely choose the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the image will be determined under it . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the du@@ ck as possible .
if you have an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee , and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets to the right below .
the printer driver allows to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Phot@@ o@@ y@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is sensible for you to improve or print the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can easily import videos to one of three formats to JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command scenes tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original version of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w , not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results ! .
first choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image conver@@ ters window appears in mode for a single picture . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white . the essential parameters like g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG use a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IFF , ret@@ ains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are going to edit your pictures more frequently or you will not be able to use the JPEG format , since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are going to select JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG image file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting your conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it .
the stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at a time . if you are sure to check out , e.g. through testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to version for individual images . however , here , however , the option has been automatically written to over@@ write . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available as far the conversion advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all photos of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it is used to reduce the image program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size or enlarge four types of image changes :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically chosen , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : provides the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo @-@ apixel . the target pattern , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the list images before . further images can go to the list of images and place there .
after being launched the module , the images will be displayed by you pre @-@ selected images . you can add another images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview can be displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be added .
the pictures will be removed from the list of the selected images from the list of the selected images .
after you have selected all photos , you can open the new message to your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the selected images are attached as app@@ endix .
pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it might send a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail Window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration will be stored and then used again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify it in the input field including the right path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you &apos;ll need to install the G@@ mail@@ agent on your computer before you can download it here .
after the selection of comments on an attached file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file and placed the email .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and do not change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and select the original files in the JPEG format , then the original extern@@ als will be added to the moving pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can see the status messages in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button you can choose this window sh@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you want to see your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transition option is using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card using Open@@ GL , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final grin@@ der . you can then break in manually with Es@@ c .
the images are randomly select that the images will be displayed in random order . so it &apos;s not used the order of pictures in the album .
under delay between the images the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 millisecon@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and is a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should point out this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between whom you can choose . randomly choose a different effect on each transition between pictures .
during the slide show you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to switch .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de.@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .

&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . one is integrated into &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; photo album ; integrated version that you can create via the File menu HTML ...
before ht@@ ml pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout , and destination . in the following , each area will be more precise .
first enter the title of the review and a description , which should contain the HTML @-@ file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages please see an example for this settings .
next , you can choose whether a &amp; photo album will be created ; the export file is to be viewed on the viewing page . more information about Export files will be found in .
last , you can select which information will be shown on the HTML page . so you can avoid that information displayed by a party . for example , all pictures are exported from a party . please note that this setting is therefore not used to hide certain images from certain viewing .
in this area , you can define how to look like the HTML page . most of the settings are clear , why it will not be received in this area .
at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures . as a result , those have to view your web page and have a monitor , which have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more download the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer faces your site can change the resolution at any time you can change . it can thus change your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , browse . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this mode area , place the different folders and URL that your website is stored .
at best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and select a new folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be stored and automatically add to the next time . you can select either a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check that these really are all for viewing a URL . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you should specify here . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files created in the final target folder you will have to manually copy them manually . this is the import function you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described adjustment possibilities have all three on the base folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder will be created , whose name you define in the output folder .
if you are located on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , you would like to add images on the pictures , Recor@@ ding place , etc . then you &apos;ll have to make a photo album ; this work does not have to do with this work .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database with exact and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images itself can be saved in the file or whether in the file you can save all the images into the file , and this file can be saved so independently . however , the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two times . first , it &apos;s all the pictures that you can find in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export .
in the following window , the dialog will be described for export images , which you can export about the File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act around internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are also the following three selection options available :
if you manually insert the .@@ k@@ in file , you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of .@@ k@@ im file , copy and photo album automatically ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . because most pictures have been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s normally not want to comp@@ ress files . if you want to comp@@ ress these files , simply select the Export file to comp@@ ress the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size limit , by example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using En@@ tries .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or choose from the File menu , select &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in described in described .
the assistant to imp@@ ot@@ ate consists of four steps . first you have to select what pictures you want to import , then in which folder will have to be copied .
it may be that you can person@@ alize the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which are to be imported into the third dialog for which the categories are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . one example will see on the picture .
it simply must be simple to search and look at : if you see pictures , you often want to watch pictures from different pictures groups &amp; md@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday , you might want to see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to find the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and respect , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ ste was started as a program to manage your photos . but it was expanded and today also takes your videos . at many places in this manual it is said about pictures , but often does this also closes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; saves all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ revisions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; notice the folder where your images are stored and uses this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; With the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / G@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
using the menu entry settings on photo@@ album ; set up to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo album ; you will be able to edit the various setup options in the following section of the user manual .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call on the options of the preview and options for viewing the viewer . for every setting , you can get a detailed help to the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can set various features for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on see the dialog box , which is used to edit existing groups already . for every group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ate as explained in the dialog .
in view the setup options which you are available to set up the member groups . with the above mentioned selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window half there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; divi@@ des his modular system with other graphic applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . for information you can find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most of the modules have a help page that you can call on the memory modules .
since the modules are used in several applications together , it can be that the modules are tested with the demo database , before you can call them on your own images . please do not hesitate to call them on your own images . do not say that I don &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I have very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
sim@@ ulated &amp; photo album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all the images that show you the picture show currently .
in addition to the current album , a photo album has to be handed over ; the modules also has a list of albums . here is a photo album ; as follows :
when &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each record of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . if you are using the category people , you will have a photo album ; so if you have selected people to view and to the module .
as some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the range modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you see an example for a starting screen once you start &amp; photo album ; start your own images .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , see the top of a menu and a tool bar . currently , there are not very many information , since you don &apos;t find any information on your images . in the section we will show this window , but now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to see each image with comments on the picture , where the image has been taken on the picture , so you can put every picture either individually or for a larger number of images specific remarks simultaneously . if for example on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for the search and brow@@ ses as you can check in the section . if you want to see this comment if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by selecting people , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you will always be able to use it when you enter information on your images .
the following idea is based on the images within the list : if you have a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can make that the names used up above are moved to people qu@@ icker and arrange them .
if you prefer to display an ill@@ iter@@ ate list , click the icon for Sort on the list below the list .
if you have chosen any comments on each image , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . Click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then you can select it more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California , are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as an over@@ group . in order to show you that it is a special symbol , a special symbol will be shown .
in the context menu of the note programme , you can also add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also pull an entry simply on a category and put it on this entry to a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes that you &apos;re straight to sort out your categories in alphabet@@ ical order .
you can move the single elements of the note dialog by clicking the top edge of the frame , click and move the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and look the appearance of the window .
you can also complete a box completely . if you would like to display this window later , use the button options ... and then click the window onto a / out window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected images , or all the images you don &apos;t have a filter here . you can see the size of the pictures , configure by simply down@@ wards of the mouse with the middle of the mouse , configure . try it simple times .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown on the picture . if you don &apos;t have a window open with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can delete pictures in the image preview picture . just select the corresponding pictures you want to er@@ ase and choose either the removing button or choose either the Edit menu or select the window you can see in the picture you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use your photo album . of course you have to store the images anywhere , so &amp; photo album ; you can see the image of &amp; photo album ; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , the pictures are available in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 there are the preview pictures available , so that the preview of these pictures can view . you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this function you need to extract files from folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the problem of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid anno@@ ying as the di@@ ps of your pictures , please purchase a bigger hard drive to save all pictures .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , fil@@ tering the images that you would like to un@@ accessible for other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and select the menu entry everything except current view .
so you have set out what pictures are to be hidden in the case of all your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all the images you want to have blocked off . if you want to display the pictures again , click the lock .
it is also possible to set a password to set up the images to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , select your password in the menu for privacy .
please remember that this photo protection is not very secure . for one of the images on the hard drive and on the other one can remove the password as un@@ turn@@ key text or delete it . this type of password protection is only available to those who are talking with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your images with &amp; photo album ; manage and hours over hours to describe them , of course you want to consider them sometime . from this reason , you can watch them out . for this reason , you can preview it out of the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional all information which you have on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see it , you can also configure them with the mouse and if you can view it . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the text menu click below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser gives you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you uploaded multiple images in the viewer , you can change between them and return by using the buttons on high and image . you can get the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ ash@@ au . you will then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be inspected by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus , and stopped through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; photo album ; is it to change in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer used the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can easily pull a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus button you can use a rectangle with the minus button . showing how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the outcome of the zoom .
using the point key you can reset your zoom , that the image does not have been zo@@ omed by pressing the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equal to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos will work in and zo@@ oming that are positive with the Plus@@ Energy and Min@@ us .
with the turn@@ out functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do comments on the current picture with the menu option from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose names will be forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can check out the picture and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . however , you will be able to mark the picture and look further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the images on paper . to see what pictures you want , you can start the viewer with pictures and mark them as good or bad , while using one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch images with features , while you watch them . characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can put a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . you can see all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so simply add one module to copy the selected images to CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially characteristics can be shown in preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can press features for the feature , after the picture has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint a photo album ; on the picture .
this is not saved with the picture , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your vegetables later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the image from the context menu . to end the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not have to domin@@ ate but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have to be read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose single objects . then their properties will be displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire model - Vie@@ ws yellow .
you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
in order to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the symbol in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be built , so that you can choose the right position :
you can either remove selected objects from the scene from the menu bar , either from the menu bar , or from the menu bar menu .
if you have altered properties , click on users to take these changes . if you have entered the values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then you can rec@@ ti@@ fy the input errors , or reject the changes with dis@@ appo@@ intments .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; input documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in Fe@@ ast View .
press a preview in Fe@@ eling View and a small example of the scene is provided with the chosen texture . as default , if you want to select a texture from texture ren@@ dering ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this inspection points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire section . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and spin as well as the position of shifts . you can change the shift through pulling in the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a ring level . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the primary object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility in smaller or equal to the most apparent visual stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window mounting as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default window structure or if you need another arrangement , you can adjust it arbit@@ rar@@ ily you can also store several windows orders and move between different orders .
to create a window above or below a view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange several views over each other , drag the starter into the middle of a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the map sheet above in the views .
the last possible shutter order are floating Vie@@ ws , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter onto the desktop or click the arrow pointing to the top left in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ t .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ line . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert extra views in the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are woven , you can get it at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window attachment ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window regulations under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click the ren@@ dering of ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu view scene .
an R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality stages , you can add any number of extra modes , from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu View ... select , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is useful to detect the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the picture &apos;s picture . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the check box and give the image cut into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just a beam of pixels , there can be different errors . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this bug . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technology is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is adap@@ tive , non @-@ cur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adap@@ tive again and adap@@ tive because each pixel is increasingly sub@@ divided and adap@@ tive because the record depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , followed in POV @-@ Ray a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color indicate the specified threshold is processed . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a gr@@ ating of 4x4 will be charged at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values is exceeded , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel that can be controlled individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another option is reduced to ali@@ asing effect , which is the generation of noise for a beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch to j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refle@@ ct@@ ance is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
in this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ en@@ output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this .
in order to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry , select the file entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently it supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; still not the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or al@@ arms , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor in order to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object into the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text editor and drag it into the lens .
cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; a scene ren@@ ders . it usually is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the own screen view , opens &amp; p@@ ov@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ dd@@ les ) in the paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different patches of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the colour of rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set up the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turn@@ outs .
larger values result in the lighter wire model and thus a better se@@ wing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like e.g. the sphere , you can set the detail level for two directions .
when you cross the high quality for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are used , if the camera uses a expanded projection . the feature is a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross wall , a wall will be rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess pattern sample from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor under the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess pattern sample from two adjustable colors .
if you cross can@@ oe trips , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . for more detailed information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can change existing windows orders or create new windows orders . in the section window regulations it will explain how you can create window orders and store .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Standard @-@ window classification : all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window connection at the start of the program .
the list of activated window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement using the button .
any window order is identified by name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected shut@@ ters . new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with un@@ ts you get the window under the existing window , with the previous view and woven , the view does not include the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; installed and now you want to start without exact knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should also create the ultimate but simple scene with very popular : a ball on a level .
but you should carefully read the following war@@ nings before you are aware that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should notice these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you add no light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark , and you will only receive a black image .
if you have any error installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following default window regulations are :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation that you can expect an adequate presentation of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the property . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ top view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate . in particular note the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the Object tree now includes a new entry with the designation Camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
change anything about the basic settings of the camera , but it &apos;s later to be reserved , but note that the camera can change the camera in view of the camera . Click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
if you press the button to button or input , change the wire model views and the lens immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the bottom for the scene . for example , if you add a header ( inser@@ tion body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a viable method for solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er , actually a simpler way to use . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button to input or input . in the object , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model displays now also shows the level , but also at the moment only as a limited level . when you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends up to horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can fold the entry into the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , spin and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizon line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and adjust the values as follows :
first , select the ground to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select the name of the object . if you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button . see how the pigment looks like .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only displays a matte black material , because you can always check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . in this way , enter the colors for the pigment . also there are many possibilities now , but do not take the easiest way now .
if you don &apos;t see in the preview no color on Qu@@ ader and Ball , click on button users and then call the Pre@@ view .
the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ ame your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , you are not the color . you are waiting here . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this too much , but the ch@@ ord color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select an object tree of each object and change the colors in view of the object characteristics :
you should already be able to execute this step as you should already understand the basic operation of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; they should be understood as easy as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can change the settings . adjust the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input or the button to press the bottom . otherwise , the ball would floating above the ground as you moved the ground to down@@ wards .
of course , there is now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . set a suitable material in the following step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can point to your material now . as already in the bottom , enter the sphere of pigments as color :
select Er@@ ror sub @-@ Ob@@ jects and change the name for example in sphere pigment . Click on sphere of pigments , select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to set some Finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
the settings of the brightness and reflection results already in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of it which features you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hop@@ efully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ p a scene , Ren@@ derer shall shoot hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which is reflected in the scene ) , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the neb@@ ula . thus , the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will be able to view the camera without a camera . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene you want to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file which you created in advance with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; created
always when you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you &apos;ve already saved the model , it will be saved by the same name . if it &apos;s a new file , you have to enter a name and disk space .
introduces the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been abandoned since the last storage .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you are not stored in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you are using revers@@ ing .
store the current window rules and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or specify an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; here you can change the look , the touch of the keyboard and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog for the modification of the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation . you can modify or add new commands to this option for the default short@@ cut for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; -@@ orders or add new options .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar . you can add and remove tool with this option tool@@ ing for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ing ; -@@ orders and remove them .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to surface rough@@ ness , without changing any diff@@ ra@@ le on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture @-@ map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by application of a picture file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ ppe show ; is a comfortable image viewer and web browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ b show is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ O ; or the return Return .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all the pictures will always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ l show ; there are five boxes . in three , General and editing and slide show , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ b show ; in the two other , short @-@ commands for the display windows and short @-@ commands for the browser you can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can continue to adjust . default is no full screen mode .
this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ b show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option saves &amp; ku@@ b show ; when launching the name of the last opened folder . the next start@@ up opens &amp; ku@@ l show ; this folder in browser window .
Click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour here .
you can create &amp; ku@@ b show ; so , only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is enlarged by large images the display window onto the full screen . this option is enabled as the default value .
specifies whether the sli@@ deshow must begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period between the image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default value is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the little arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the button for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ b show ; in the card cards short @-@ commands for the display windows and short @-@ commands for the browser .
with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ line view of the file system ( a window for the sub @-@ folder and a window for the files ) and one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
shows preview pictures for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ l show ; also closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aled is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you want to search . if the file is found , it will be selected .

the show@@ case is trying to give you much control of its work @-@ ups as possible . there are many options that you can access these settings , you need to set up in the menu settings dialog . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color which is indicated when the sub@@ or over@@ exposed dict@@ ator should select the colors using what you should see , in contrast , a bright colour and over@@ exposure time should display the dark color .
the main window of &amp; entertainment photograph ; possesses a page bar at the right edge , which gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find this in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for sc@@ ap@@ ots of images that do not make more power than images and en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is a simple application for sc@@ ap@@ ots of images that do not make more than images to scan and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also show the images in front of the store .
you can review the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by pressing the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projection .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialogue is opened to the selection of the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . drain &amp; sc@@ roll down .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat .
to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ can and then enter the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better the user can select the image in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview of the window fits .
if the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you choose to store a preview in the settings , then the picture will be shown in a box window , as shown below . if you hold down , the image will be saved and sub@@ lie ? EN leads to a break and you will come back to the main window .
with the button settings , the same name dialog will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , if desired . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview can not be requested by the user , then the option must be dra@@ gged .
this setting allows you to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Pictures will open the dialog for each image open the dialog in front of each c@@ tured image . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will automatically store a file defined in a previously defined folder , then you need to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the option without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for dialogue . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the displayed images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the image stored in the image will be numbered by a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of every frame if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value is also changing the compression value when you select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

&amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs touch buttons . below you can set up a list of these cuts and its function . you can choose to set up with the right mouse button in the player window , click with the right mouse button in the player window , click here and select shor@@ tening ... select .
you can also set up existing multimedia keys so that it will work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; short @-@ commands work . thereby you make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , pla@@ ylist , pla@@ ylist , re @-@ pla@@ ylist , re @-@ pla@@ ylist , playback and scripts . like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command lines options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok still has some own command scenes options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dep@@ en@@ dency if all required modules are present and use dialog for sure that the user does not exp@@ ire why a script will not run .
Beg@@ in Re@@ qu@@ ire &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE @-@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the Scri@@ ptures / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will find fast that the letter of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that should be used every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts themselves allow the result of external programs and commands . to this point the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here , an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sending al@@ er@@ ts to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts to define their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use of it .
configure the script to indicate the setup dialog . in order to store the Save and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok requires the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the product length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in the volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : the path to select the selected files of the pla@@ ylist , if a custom menu entry can be identified . in order to add your own entry , you can use the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script script script you use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok Script as e@@ Cust@@ om@@ men@@ u@@ ette ( subtle Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal must be processed by SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . for example , this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script script may also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are also being compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can also be detected also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Extended Power script . for this reason , you should make your script equal correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can re@@ load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang up the link to the wi@@ ki Script page by &amp; amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category of amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can simply pull music in the pla@@ ylist , rather than to work through endless menus . if you are just looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Colle@@ ct browser and the quick@@ est search will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some pla@@ ylist , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then , if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart pla@@ ylist automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many general USB devices . this and many other useful features are making Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sch@@ ick - just the right to experience your music !

&amp; amar@@ ok ; has the most applications several options that you can dis@@ able or dis@@ able at review date with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
some dep@@ enden@@ cies must be fulfilled for some of the compilation options to be used , so that they can be used for details in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ist Deb@@ ug@@ ches symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help you with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you would be full to use .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; easy to set up with the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to address the different functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
players will display the player window in addition to the pla@@ ylist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; amar@@ ok ; used with support for mo@@ od@@ able . the option switches the experimental function of the tun@@ ometer .
shap@@ ing , this function is only available when &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar has been compiled . therefore , the used color scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer is changed .
voting files on music files : this function is only available when &amp; amar@@ ok ; if this setting has been activated , .@@ mood files at the location of the respective musical files are stored . otherwise , the .@@ mood files at the Settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / n@@ od@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose what browser is needed by &amp; amar@@ ok ; when a browser is needed .
using other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not located in the list above .
pla@@ ylist for storing and store the current pla@@ ylist automatically when using &amp; amar@@ ok ; activate this option , if you want to lose the running pla@@ ylist when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored pla@@ ylist : if you activate this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , based on the location of the pla@@ ylist , otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
as a current turn , the pla@@ ylist window will make sure that the pla@@ ylist window / rolls , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window .
when using the context of the context of the context of the context , the context of the context will automatically be played as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance is in three parts sub @-@ section .
in the fon@@ ts section you can select the use of various writings in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select files for the following sections : pla@@ ylist windows , player window , and context brow@@ sers . press on exit ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
the choice of custom color scheme you have even set the ratios of choice and you can define their own color scheme . use the selected colour selection for front and background color .
playback at the start starts that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last signal .
the sub @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . Click on out to select from the dialog select the desired text type for the O@@ SD . check the shadow that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
your own colours are using the possibility to match the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the text box display text sets the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by using the plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to suit your needs . below you will find a list of available seats and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . you can define , on which screen a multiple monitor environment is to appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the select box . some drivers will enable further settings in this box card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder you want to browse and browse through music files . in order to include a folder to the collection , select the check box next to his name . this section also contains the check boxes in addition to the selected folders .
browse the sub @-@ folders : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the people crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
changes : enabled &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
to import the pla@@ ylist : bring that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found pla@@ ylist in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ or and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the added pla@@ ylist will later appear later in the pla@@ ylist .
the part collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ SQL . if My@@ SQL is selected , yet another device in the sub @-@ window My@@ SQL is necessary .
the My@@ SQL setup is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used to enter the My@@ SQL database . then under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessed . name : if the database name is to which the connection is made .
use user@@ name : and password : to insert the data which are needed for the connection to the database .
the card card ar@@ .@@ f@@ m will support the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces onto a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server , and create music recommendations concerning the current product .
here you enter your user@@ name and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send sections and update the profile : this setting allows you to transmit it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces at your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation this setting will be retri@@ eve &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to be seen in each piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screens .
amar@@ o@@ K requires only the box K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to find K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained in it ) and require some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts . we have written a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as O@@ SD would like that your window manager uses the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support amar@@ ine K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will show a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can view this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org and put the cap@@ tiv@@ ated file which caused the crash . then you can delete the file and let the file again be created .
mostly this is the fact that Tag@@ li@@ b comes from this file cr@@ ashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use My@@ SQL as a database , then try to SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads to crash when working the Met@@ a .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machine automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the Back@@ way by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open at a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good backup , the error is guaranteed .
this is the fact that many program can write data as UTF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a info , but this is not regarded as Unicode code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; ; buy _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ ror when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random smo@@ kes / repet@@ itive pla@@ ylist ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you can find the status de@@ activ@@ ates in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must be identified , until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this bug : Not@@ o@@ app error : non@@ ook@@ up error : im@@ aster icon : unknown icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel resolution , then please check if amar@@ ine K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ n@@ ave &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so you will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems always clari@@ fy your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help for other users or with the developers . use this forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de.@@ net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error , if something is on the rec@@ tification of a defect in amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; there is only a blank pla@@ ylist . how do you get music tracks ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the pla@@ ylist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was transformed into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate the pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the pla@@ ylist and select column . Click on the Tit@@ le column of the pla@@ ylist and select column . Click here to set up the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection , and then choose from the drop @-@ down menu .
pull out a pla@@ ylist with the mouse into the pla@@ ylist and let it fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the pla@@ ylist , directly next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button pla@@ ylist . Click on it .
presumably there &apos;s the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .
the equ@@ al@@ izer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right button of the mouse ) . additionally , you will find it via the menu bar under the ex@@ tras E@@ qual@@ izer ....
no . yes , it &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / M@@ AS / M@@ AS / M@@ AS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can even support text and P@@ NG en@@ code .
it may be ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered in default no MP3 de@@ or ( from pat@@ ent@@ ment reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 , input , input
start the Y@@ a@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you are using the CSA driver using the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink device , the device must use a bl@@ ender . this can be used simultaneously using a sound card mixer ( eg . S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . see also the help of the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of the problem and a solution . for track you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does not do so . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . they can only use a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can use directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ L@@ amer Dri@@ vers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server using highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ is@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
for K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there is problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause re@@ bo@@ xed playback . read this bug report . read this bug report . Enlarge Enlarge The Sound buffer file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead gain G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less applications react to the visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ L@@ amer Dri@@ ft driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; amar@@ ok ; from why ?
after installing the Stre@@ amer , you will have to register all components . register your register @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
you can read the G@@ L@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop amar@@ isk at the same time ! ) : - Char@@ ge you down , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ peg config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ( you will find your code folder once again . starting now &amp; amar@@ ok ; ) .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. when you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our ma@@ iling list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP , it is possible to make an alarm in your calendar program and let it work with the alarm on this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play
this command lets you start &amp; amar@@ ok ; make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the sandy tones of the music that you stopped ahead of bed .
how can you find the currently in &amp; amar@@ ok ; ongoing title if you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a functional SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user de@@ user name amar@@ ok player , t@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP address and your user@@ name . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ izations can be separated by the &amp; amar@@ ok ; press a window separately . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size changing window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights mouse button provides a piece in the queu@@ e sequence in the queu@@ e . by pressing the input to a search in the pla@@ ylist , the first result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the pla@@ ylist have tri@@ ck@@ rich features , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser is to be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the launch of amar@@ o@@ K , the collection database can &apos;t be created and appear on the console many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to left ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s My@@ SQL support .
insert the CD , then click on a file browser with several folders . you will open a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , you will select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you will receive files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a descending value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has any impact on the overall result .
you can set the evaluation for a piece itself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column he@@ aders in the pla@@ ylist , click here : select the evaluation of a piece of mouse click on the piece and Edit : assessment or pressing F2 . you can modify the evaluation in the met@@ ad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want to release you when you &apos;re going to release a stable version of amar@@ o@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have set up a fixed date plan which is not to bring together with the short @-@ term plan of amar@@ o@@ K .
this is a new function in amar@@ o@@ K , but some users can easily find ner@@ ves . de@@ activate the icon icon in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select settings of tool@@ bar ... and take the required changes before .
upload a design , or create an own . install this then you can set up with amar@@ an K ... appearance context context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties . it was removed too .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation sector allows you the monitoring and control of &amp; amar@@ ok ; while you can view Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F9 to display the navigation area . Click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio cro@@ bler is a free service to the information on the information that are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ ms and thereby caused a lot of error reports .
presumably &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the output module does not compiled this output modules . you need &amp; install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
probably use a distribution that install the development files are installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the required development files . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to comp@@ ile and install .
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Criti@@ cal * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ stre@@ amer was compiled with Pre@@ ) , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to comp@@ ile G@@ streaming without pre@@ ference . a tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : uses no LD@@ FLA@@ GS if you comp@@ ile amar@@ ine K .
I get the error message there is no element present to the file &apos;s m@@ im@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp4 or m@@ 4a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must also have to be able to install the g@@ ail@@ amer @-@ real @-@ time module .
you will receive the Er@@ is no element present to conduct the stream &apos;s m@@ im@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator register . then you start amar@@ o@@ K .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can you use amar@@ o@@ K use the second sound@@ card ?
you can set up an audio output under Settings ... audio output type you specify the device . typically , e.g. HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an optional AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ b @-@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm , &quot; HW : 0 &quot; } ct@@ ox 0 } pc@@ s. us@@ b @-@ Audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ inch &quot; HW : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ Audio { type HW @-@ 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual mix device , dis@@ able the tick with sound card .
we &apos;re sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be cared for . you may want to take this problem by yourself into the hand ! if you want , you can become the new so ur@@ gently necessary care for Arts : )

the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can choose from existing pla@@ ylist or smart pla@@ ylist , will add &amp; amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the crossed pla@@ ylist .
some scripts allow own settings . you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on button .
you can install new &amp; amar@@ ok ; select script by clicking on script . after using the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . you can also get new scripts directly from the internet .
if you do not wish to use a script , you can delete it . then select the script that you want to delete or un@@ install it .
if you are looking for information to write your scripts , please take a look at the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ al@@ izing plug@@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ al@@ izations in &amp; amar@@ ok ; used . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . in order to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick instructions should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you will need to follow the steps below , you must have an open installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 or other compressed compressed formats , you think that you can renew the bit@@ rate to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check whether a audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ t@@ ect tool for this purpose .
in this dialog box you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this quick instructions should show you how to copy the CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you have to follow a loud CD in just four steps . you must have a loud installation by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
for cop@@ ying a data CD , please copy ex@@ tras , CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialogue with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button Start button . you can see a dialogue of such a way or looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original file is complete , you will be asked to burn the data on a blank CD media .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the total progress reaches 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the total progress reaches 100 % .

V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : one in the functional scope of the equipped car system to work , dis@@ assemble and analysis of video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . it can be useful for example to create mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections , for example , can lead the different recording level of different albums , which are different according to the un@@ fair effect , which are different according to music .
e@@ Movi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos on the base folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
store the current project . if the project has already been saved once , the written file will be over@@ written before , otherwise , after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save will be displayed when you select a folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would like to store every single project file .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should be done . you can then go between store and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any not stored project , what should be done so you could have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finishes and over K@@ 3@@ b ; for each stored project , what should be done so as if you would have called closing the file .
if you call this entry , you can select files from the published dialogue files to the project . that &apos;s the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a CD @-@ ROM , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can set many proj@@ ections of this project . each project type has different possible settings , most of them about what is it ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will appear only for an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry will appear only on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium which will only end the previously imported files .
opens the CD cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also find a copy of a CD instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only be able to burn a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying a DVD , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( vide@@ ot@@ ape ) data from the source media in its original form .
opens the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW , so you can er@@ ase the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the form@@ att@@ ing of a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between write and incre@@ mental .
burns a CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are unfortunately not supported , for that , you need to use other tools such as No@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns an earlier DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously made DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears normally after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used too @-@ standing . it contains information about the l@@ ent video , body settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the specified medium . this information will be displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a little body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the directory has been activated , their content will also have a context menu with features such as Media Info , sper@@ ren and un@@ lock of the disk or throw off the medium .
switches the table view or from . the table view allows you to select and drag files into the projection view . the table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
the head bar is activated at or out . the head@@ board is a nar@@ rower area that contains only visible if the project &apos;s project is open . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only nicely from and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog for changing the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order to further below .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assistance systems . this enables the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator needs to enter the password for the administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should be on request . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and intended for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or that something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the functional scope , therefore it &apos;s rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which den@@ ying the fair programs you want .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP , -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Dat@@ a@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . cre@@ at@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ Project ( ) , cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) , cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) vol@@ ved C@@ dr@@ w ( ) , bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ image ( ) , bur@@ n@@ c@@ v@@ d ( ) .
as a result of such cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d ) and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Dat@@ a@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
. cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) a cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string par@@ ent ) , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) provided by add@@ res@@ l ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ bor@@ ns ) . ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) with set@@ list e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / Bas@@ h Project = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Dat@@ a@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der is d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project Cr@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ ff@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; it is a audio CD ; it can easily be read and saved in MP@@ 3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many cor@@ di@@ ers that these WAV files are supported ( comp@@ elling free compression ) , and more coding can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed to MP@@ 3s or OGG files or other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ a ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers are already available , it is highly likely not necessary to comp@@ ile a bit . however , only the coefficients will not be used . if you do not use FLA@@ C , the installation is not necessary .
what encoding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sive factors .
a word to cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s : like already said , used &amp; k@@ ill@@ iter@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not available for any cop@@ ying protection ; it is not possible to remove any protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; even if not the mechanisms of cop@@ ying protection . avoid simply the purchase of cop@@ ying audio CD ; s !
while doing only once has to be done ( the setup dialog , but can be called as often called up to an appropriate configuration ) , after everyday use of a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim design of the user interface , which you are often stum@@ bling at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything will be recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step example , more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
launch the CD@@ DB request from CD @-@ data according to the tool by request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet can be made . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the setup page in the setup catalog - coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with any other Encoder as the standard . it is to note that the encoder has been configured in the setup dialog for setup dialog .
opens the file manager , allowing a file to en@@ code and en@@ code them instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main layout dialog of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; with various card cards ( such as Encoder , for setting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you with the right co@@ di@@ ers .
when no audio information should be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data comp@@ resses depending on their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG saved the most often . OGG today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , it is still provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG easily deeper quality at a deeper bit rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tracks are available .
MP3 - if music is also part of other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo modes . today - initially 2009 - these devices support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most of music @-@ pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ stereo stereo plants with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo stereo modes with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate of about 5.5 . do always need 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo modes with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , a stereo , compression rate of approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ o@@ lics . but not good enough for better stereo stereo modes .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely don &apos;t want the absolutely highest quality without any feedback to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which are manually entered or through the program automatically entered from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can use / used with &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the coefficients and these parameters here . the manual or assistance to the coding do the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with lame are coded , the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator has to be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { ... } .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button in the assistant ) :
that &apos;s what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which information can download / enter , so that all other information can download / enter , so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( Appe@@ al of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ y ) : that is the author of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ y . however , no one can prevent the artist or CD ; any more or less valuable , so either the artist or CD @-@ company can be added . all information can be given thanks to a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box ( S@@ ing an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eve the data from server ( but this can only know the programmer that checks the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ o at the next underlying mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the host .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created every month ) only the updates of the database .
what is the reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ oured that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know it , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must be installed at first , if this is not done .
to store the advert@@ ised WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and therefore the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for you ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ sing free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the register tab . other coding can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined coefficient of Ko@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ers , more information can be received via the input of a command like lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check the setup of the device designation of &amp; CD ; / DVD lear@@ ner , write and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio coding of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could be a hint that is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the she@@ ath of the &amp; CD ; this will not be able to succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , but they understood not always un@@ certain what is to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;re going to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame are already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it cannot be considered as a fully @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files what you can always do .
please make sure that the / us@@ r / share / cd / cd exists and that you have write permission to have ( eg ; by trying to copy in with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section deals with the basic setting of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression of music ( optional ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 @-@ 256 k@@ bps ) , where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program using fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to check out a &amp; CD if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program , so it is able to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to create existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo .
only in case of in@@ complete information , select so that you will be informed if information on account of key@@ words ( tags ) are missing .
the card box CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet , so that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately , when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ qu@@ order &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , then dis@@ able the box fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used if you want to use the database before . however , these two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how knows the system you want to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . use everything that is depicted in screen photo .
mode : we do not have the database available , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to site fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . on this path the load is distributed between the host . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both of them work equ@@ alled as to the server , since there are many fire@@ wall in the protocol 88@@ 80 , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first deposit box should be sufficient .
just take the settings of the screen photo . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one using existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es and en@@ code ? the author does not know , therefore just trying to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , you cross this to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you cross it , then / must be the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . this field cannot be crossed , if you do not want to use the files in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything you enter as it is on screen photo . the command is slightly long , under certain circumstances , some might need to be seen in order to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is an attitude for very good audio quality , even for very good audio quality stereo facilities . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the generation of tags at version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 1.@@ 1@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted when necessary , in case of a later change of tags . % f and % are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we have just finished the basic equipment of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for any excerpt of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisation structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be able to create MP3 files . firstly , there will be a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will have to pick up . the process of this section must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD ; it has to be repeated for each additional &amp; CD .
as we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos look at a little differently than for a &amp; CD ; so you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of sending them from the Internet . comments will point out to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample you can find . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only when the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; can be identified and saved by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happens , you will find questions and answers after assistance , or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces have already been completed and then the name of the artist and album will be displayed .
in the case that there are more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window embedded , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually select this by selecting the first button@@ holes in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; updated title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; updates &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for each piece of ini@@ em@@ as per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to verify the contents of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you do not only start with the artist or album names ( eg . if all words with letters begin or not ... ) , but also to verify whether there are any un@@ desirable remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restri@@ cts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comm@@ ent@@ ard . this option is set up on the coefficient of Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ ts ; take a look inside the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the files created later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see in the help of co@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which is obviously with the style of the selected CD ; this is not important because we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; data so@@ iling anyway . for more information go to Web site of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or ap to the example are under rock .
after choosing the &apos; OK &apos; , come back to the main window . Click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you can see that the fields are filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . specify the entries for the fields of the current item . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
Click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you have all the title data of &amp; CD ; entered .
please note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . you are already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the product list .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece . only the title can be selected so that a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or put the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
when clicking on the button selection process has been started , this window appears to confirm your confirmation . you click on OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
Click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is on the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a co@@ ater , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked : write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and en@@ code in parallel . note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes , the result is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D64 appears no problem when simultaneously reading and en@@ code ( from there two different things ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you will need the coefficients of your choice .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is a part of the pyramid box . however , if you are using CV@@ S . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; kiss ; if you read this , you probably have done it probably already ...
this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile the source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance such as the program can be adjusted to suit your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen pictures of the different cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still am reading , even if only the help menu has been clicked on the program , without any viewing point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( above all , if there is no audio CD , in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot add this manual . it &apos;s the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; it is intended to do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he does not leave this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange , if it &apos;s managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information but ...
&amp; k@@ mid . is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oc@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he did not have a real @-@ time graphic presentation of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projector for G@@ US maps . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence of sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid . shows the song text on the screen with changing paint , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel due to emphasis of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song suit@@ ability or T@@ exter@@ min@@ isse ) . S@@ id determines automatically the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song the next time .
supports external MIDI synth@@ es@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also download a file from a &amp; con@@ stri@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Windows can be dropped . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and worked the button finish in the tool bar , select the entry down from the menu pieces or put the le@@ dge .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played on succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece play , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the regulator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of speed display and then change the play@@ speed . to get the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the le@@ dge has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button can break as a pressure on the button or choose the menu of the menu , so the playback will be played while no piece is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in one music piece . some pieces use T@@ exter@@ min@@ ers , others use lyrics , and again other types . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better : the event of the event is automatically chosen , so that you don &apos;t need to adjust the automatic kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up a type of event , select from the menu settings the entries of T@@ exter@@ min@@ isse or song events . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ize . these will be played by the series . in this section stands how to use collections .
in order to put a collection , open first the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... Click there to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired value in the collection manager .
into the temporary collection of all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
in case of application the application is not saved . write this collection if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button . again , the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection .
if automatic add is enabled to the collection , a piece of opening ( using the file open or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if Autom@@ atically Adding to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied for opening a piece of the temporary collection , then the collection will continue to be opened .
in order to remove a song from a collection , you must select the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the sequence in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they have been added to the collection .
if you add songs or choose random sequence in the menu , the order will be determined .
in order to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to jump another song , select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , the record &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the menu or press the arrow on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to er@@ ase a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection may not be deleted . however , this does not matter if it is stored in the leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored .
this is definitely necessary for Syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands the synth@@ es@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type of Change @-@ patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus leaves a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including AW@@ E - and G@@ US maps , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite se@@ itor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all required settings for the playback of a piece .
each section can only appear once , except the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which must appear as often as desired . but the condition is that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that one section starts ( except for Op@@ tions ) and EN@@ D that the end of an section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can do in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices which are not compatible with General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches will be depicted as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard , as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM @-@ patches is in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , but also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all tones of this instrument on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ les ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here comes with the concept drum patch of Patch , where each tone is a different tone instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum means ( like some key@@ boards have ) .
the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to give as sounds shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ words for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names only in the first row .
key@@ words are used mainly to form sounds on the c@@ apping channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ words .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange for the first and second channel , simply do this in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must of course be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored , try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the Per@@ kus@@ &apos;s patch to the Per@@ umb@@ nail channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ ie ratio has to be multiplied in which relationship with the value of pitch will be converted to the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make a dec@@ imal value in the Map file .
this setting is used because GM assumes that a keyboard , that is to play a pitch of the event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher should play . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will be able to play two sounds up to a octave up . to try the right value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll need to try a bit by &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI Settings . you can find the MIDI settings in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ als ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these lam@@ b@@ ons you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you have changed a instrument , the button does not sh@@ one more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to indicate the played sounds . the view can choose the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the speed of a song . if you find , e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way .
good , I can not ad@@ ar to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synth@@ es@@ izer . if using a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have the control over everything .
this can happen if you compiled a bin@@ ocular ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; because it has been compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source code ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t have a desire to add all files individually .
agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Windows .
in advance , enable automatic adjustment of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can select the arrow button on the left of temp@@ o LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; work area a &amp; con@@ stri@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this work area ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , merely go to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows , and drag the file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file , without them directly to a collection , turn the automatic adjustment of automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ E. Zu@@ k@@ not only want to play the first file . so adjust the automatic adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you want to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ate this , continue to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the pla@@ ylist . and finally there is a information window that will only appear when information is returned to it .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections under the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are used after each other , then you should use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; category . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you anc@@ ill@@ ary one entry , his group will be copied to the current category and play the playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous pla@@ ylist can also be changed by direct editing , but also by application itself . by clicking on a name of a category , click on the menu view and as next processing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing from XML files , you have to choose from the menu with pla@@ ylist and select either the processing mode or select a different category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without the pla@@ ylist with the pla@@ ylist .
as a result of the author of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched to by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and moving can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing from &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting does not need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of a different source . however , this would be anno@@ ying with the end @-@ animation , the user can stop the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the advertis@@ ements of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / sec ; / sec ; / sec ; / sec ; / body@@ suits ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;

the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles working and to search for error messages . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is written within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a pre @-@ built back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this should be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on should playback all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play on TV cards , either by MP@@ 3s or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner will need to be used manually , or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video Port . there should be ports detected , from which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably includes a DVB @-@ in .
since the V@@ DR function can function only X@@ video ( probably this kind of playing video devices could work on Linux ) . this is also supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux is to function for the X server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

are there any indications like I can play my CD@@ ROM , when I play off from it ( not by the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run root under the integration of the device . this is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts up slowly , why does my CPU needs to be tested on their power each time ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably is likely to print on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively , or tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution can be included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes a few compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distribution boxes . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered to be taken into account . if the support is requested to receive this project or documentation , the contact is to be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
questions on or with the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programmes in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex . in addition , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management must be called .
in order to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his options to experience the manual should be used . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter by clicking the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex , it is the correct exception : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is difficult to use it is possible to use a lay@@ man ( English . L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic detection is that it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in this case , only a good news to &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book to rule . e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd edition , 1999 .
as other identification languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which all common features such as paper format , page num@@ bering and text size are specified as well as a reality with the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class that starts with the command \ \ sequence { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ in { document } .
the quick @-@ rise assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a comprehensive function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; C@@ ile ; . the selection of the assistant ( men@@ tions ) offers a number of results for the creation of the document . it also enables some of the document related to the document .
documentation of the document : hereby , the type of document to document document : article ( ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ n@@ cl &#93; , printed ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best should use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most common additional packages used for &amp; lat@@ ex ; depending on the connection , they only need to be washed in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation of Kom@@ a Script Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used for creating German texts .
new users do not have to worry about . it is only a short description of functions and more detailed information can be given in the section .
&amp; ile ; provides - just like other source code ed@@ itors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ appropriate ) , it is a simple problem looking through that any mathematical environment was not closed . however , it is made possible by a modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you through the emphasis time and space .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments with a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated a space line ( for the input of the text ) and the added one ( e.g. \ \ \ command } ) . this function can be activated in the settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex . object the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ divided element ) :
in the view@@ point of the document , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective elements .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files may be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; Ger@@ Ã ¤ un@@ ab@@ normal file ) &#93; has been created , jumps and k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ view to the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document , and other information such as the font and is also available in PDF the Ã ¼ al output type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex . there are many tools for view , conversion and print from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and materials .
when using the design , the elements of the DVI ; file were clicked with the editor and as soon as a element in the DVI ; file extension is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex file , the source code is clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
Master Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . using a Master document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project can be set up project settings for project settings .
quick release : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code is available ) .
file monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file on the extent of the file would be done , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; following the quick structure .
considering the processing of the work tool , the three large selection box should be developed . the selection fields were developed for quick integration of document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ sible and lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box more is for inser@@ ting of articles such as tags , fu@@ ther , notes , or references . options available for buildings are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection ) of a selection box .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries will appear . if &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be found in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ r is used for determining the font size . it is possible to specify the fon@@ ts for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã ¼ notes etc . there are the following characters available :
in the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available for processing : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determination of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand on the hand .
the brackets on the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ Class contain the settings for the order . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size specified . if the font size is specified , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the building construction or the pop @-@ up building .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . store and store up automatically .
the compilation of the document command should be visited in the log after the errors . when using quick @-@ structure &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log file should also be respected .
an area ( English . ) is a text that will be different from the rest document . for example , a report with the written document shall be created and just a few south exposure . the order \ \ Beg@@ in { Terms } , \ \ ) and \ \ by { Terms } in terms of the size of the written form .
the required limitation will only be accepted within the environment ( from \ \ ) to \ \ by { Terms } up to \ \ \ } . there is no restriction ( number ) for each other in a environment .
for example , there are many mut@@ ations for the ability of read and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain type of fon@@ ts , gre@@ ener , sub@@ cut@@ ters , etc . these commands are either using the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cran@@ ial pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { amp } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented by \ \ \ &apos; word } .
\ \ &apos; quota : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { odds } and ends with \ \ \ &apos; quota } .
after the background to writing the source text by the &amp; Lat@@ ex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide .
as soon as the assistant was entered a bit text , some changes for the better read of the document should be performed . at this point a quote , a few places in the fat and cran@@ ial pressure , should come to the application to view the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed by editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ E ( by the internal viewer ) , it has to be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted and fun .
DVI ; is a few @-@ quality file format ( narrow . D e V ice I n@@ d. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ Edition like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document via file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool shows the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code can start converting other formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the pre@@ w@@ ast@@ ness search the direct jump from the editor to your added position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ d files . it only needs to set up Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Continue reading tools construction .
in order to search the pre @-@ search @-@ search , the mouse has to be positioned in a line of the source text and close it . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out .
using this feature in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document and appropriate lines . this must be done as text editor ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; as text editor you have to set up the ey@@ ep@@ iece - editor only )
if the use of quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ view doesn &apos;t need to be a mistake . if a bug is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file indicates the error source in the source text . the log file is always used to view the faul@@ ty line . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the log file must be clicked on the error in the log , navigating immediately to the faul@@ ty line .
once upon the respective button in the tool bar , a window appears to choose the selection of the displayed template for the document . the pre@@ set properties are :
when selecting the empty document , a document may either be re@@ written or used to create a new document or an assistant to the fast creation of a new document . more information are included in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates are created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file extension or a new file must be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings and set up the settings in general .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what strings can be replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ EN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is subst@@ it@@ uted by entering in docum@@ ent@@ ations . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ EN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { $ &#93; .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and thus verb@@ al obj@@ ections to the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , then the own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet , and should be moved under the described steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for the possibility of reading and approach of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out of paper tools .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his mos@@ quit@@ oes should be used to experience the manual . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; are there directly with the reading of the chapter by clicking the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command pre@@ ference which can be called by the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an elab@@ orate description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used as well as their syntax .
a double click with penet@@ rated string key to balance the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ certified \ \ certified \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) .
when pulling the text into a text with a left mouse button , the balanced text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a pier@@ ced buttons parts of the source text in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source tex@@ ts to well and to say that . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands themselves distinguish between the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants are book@@ able . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this trampoline is highlighted by the leap for the next or last ski mark . this trampoline is highlighted by the first input of a sign automatically .
the work is probably one of the main situations at use of a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; however , important functions for writing the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; detailed functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under work interpre@@ ting are the following commands are contained in the text selection :
w@@ ishing a complete paragraph of lines that contain an empty line ( like in other text editor ) . this extended meaning should be included with tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only hum@@ orous thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the aby@@ ss@@ es are separated by two blank lines .
keep the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has a extended star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to be a part of the document , nat@@ ches can be removed at first of this first . &amp; K@@ ate , with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with your own request for a faster GPU . under processing , the following commands are contained to the text of the text :
a complete paragraph can be removed . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description on working .
it was already clear that environments will play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , it offers &amp; hur@@ ry ; for further orders under the work environment for a simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
with this command the cur@@ sor is placed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command the cur@@ sor is placed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area .
if the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } , the cur@@ sor is injected at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many different ambient temperatures , fast the daily amount can be lost quickly . this command is close to the last possible environment , so that the external environmental structure is not distor@@ ted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands , which correspond to their work environment .
with this command the cur@@ sor is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded K@@ lam@@ mer .
with this command the cur@@ sor is placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded K@@ lam@@ mer .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded K@@ lam@@ mer of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) .
when entering lots of welded groups cl@@ amps , fast the daily amount can be lost quickly . this command will close the last , so that the du@@ ck structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not distor@@ ted .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple control signs used as a standard for use . for the purpose of this purpose , the sign is used . for this case , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close connection signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic feeding of the double starter can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and follow @-@ up .
it can also be used as specific settings ( e.g. n@@ d. or French ) and thus German or fran@@ kin@@ etic instructions . there are also many other languages available .
at the Dr@@ ums of Shift ; Inclu@@ sive and k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. breaks , or it@@ em@@ ize ) ; not only a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables setting , t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an incoming line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ p@@ set the pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this enables you to configure , setup ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables environments , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) are related to each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not to be able to add @-@ in ; according to the n@@ essing table , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some of them add to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; K@@ ate , already a good source text content , it was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands are installed , three of which are necessary for the automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different working hours under Settings .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the command \ \ &apos; environment , after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the start button , the last character of the input will be removed and can be filled with it . on the other hand , the list can also reduce the list by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a command . alternatively , ski marks are possible , so that a simply jump to these positions by means of this jumping marks are possible and the desired parameters will be frozen .
under att@@ ing settings ; set up , make it possible to make this lists . there are various W@@ Ã ¢ teau lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders as well as W@@ ritten on the general language used .
the command mode is not used for the processing of environments . it is always used to have a few letters with \ \ \ in and the call for the event will be done . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments to be used for processing .
during the call of the full @-@ time periods or the keyboard unit Alt + Shift key , the command will automatically be frozen and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { and then the environmental impact can be completed and terminated by pressing the input button .
after this is complete , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; we know that it is a first \ \ item command will have been frozen .
under Settings ; make up a t@@ ile ... hur@@ ry ; this mode is used to do so mode for these lists . this mode uses the W@@ W list of the process for compensation &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders .
&amp; ile ; under@@ stands user @-@ defined lists of removable strings , which are immediately arranged by l@@ ile strings . the lists can be ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the Word was fully initiated and replaced the string of the string of the string C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
gross negli@@ gent are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been noted that many whales are written in a document more than once . so it offers &amp; hur@@ ry ; for all they are already written down .
this mode can be able to set up serial settings like a tile . here , the swelling can be specified here too . here , the swelling can be specified for the placement of the order .
the processing files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / mode . mode stands for scanning ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¢ teau ) or tex .
the dialog presents graphics to graphics as simple as possible . to the extent of the fundament@@ als of the graphic form the sections should be respected and respected .
PS files are not so known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for downloading and re@@ inst@@ ances of pages . if the PDF issue is enabled , then you can re @-@ use the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; the tools are re @-@ ordered and then converted to a PDF file with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to receive the result of the job , you need to concentrate on the source text . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the green creation of creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and create .
for comp@@ ile the source tex@@ tual for viewer , like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the further conversion can be used to be used by pressing alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and by pressing alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when used for quick release , a viewer is normally called to comp@@ ile a viewer . should not be used if any built viewer is used , a new window will be opened .
a new project will download the project New Project .... In case the following information is asked for the project :
when used in the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the scripts from EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts are to be managed to manage scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be created in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first needs to be said that the alignment environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = valves ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly detailed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support the user .
Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are delivered with many documents , which include a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is a fully exhau@@ sti@@ ble Re@@ jo@@ z for &amp; tex ; and none of these programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for search of a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; hur@@ ile ; divided into three key marks .
thanks to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the Find of the right document is not always easy . as an open help , the small application is tex@@ tured on , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and included in a graphic surface area .

the version 3.2 of &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; quantitative . all these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in rapid , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows the pro@@ c and how superior to it . let &apos;s even lift it a piece of graphical user ! not just put it on a terminal ; simply clicked the icon for the XML processor and ready !
this application awaits an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ tr@@ ump in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ tr@@ . if not , then remove the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current tasks and specify it in the field of other folders to the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time when attemp@@ ting to start pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application . and with &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical user interface .
if the only opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ tr@@ is , then they simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the most recent working folder and give it the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ tr@@ is to be found .
if it comes to an output at the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again .
if the file is already selected in &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then release the current file simply . if not , delete it on current file the tick and select the file with other file - file selection .
if they only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; it is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( default ) and specify the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; file selection as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , the indication of the defin@@ itions @-@ UR@@ I , is required in the file selection .
Ja@@ well , &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file processed in &amp; quantitative file is already marked , then they can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file format using the other file file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result is to be named , and the file will normally be stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative . may have to do with &amp; quantitative . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the desired position in &amp; quantitative . the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GU@@ I ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GU@@ I . more about this can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or part 1 , we begin with the menu plug@@ ins . this is what the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new elements . we describe each &amp; GU@@ I ; item in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location , it is quantitative &amp; quantitative . this path to the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to one another . &amp; quantitative met@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project like both team leaders as well as Sub@@ project ladder .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by pressing the team member of the list and pressing the button as well . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important as news and comments . see for further information .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team : it may be an event for information to the team manager , if something particular happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something special in the project is happening . an example would be the opening of the opening and closing of the project that a file is secured , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will be added a file into CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project settings dialog can create events , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address data selected in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project ladder . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be established .
comments are special comments on documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
note comments is simple . it can either choose the Note entry menu from the Editor menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation Key word in a comment area followed by note text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the nick@@ name of the team member states or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , the role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager of Head of Sub@@ project leaders should be given in the appropriate en@@ rich@@ ment or sub@@ project name , such as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small numbers , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nostic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; quantitative settings ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be setup via Settings Qu@@ anta ... Continue reading this dialogue , spann@@ ing some pages that will be treated suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; regarding to tags , including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / small volume of tags : large / small friction of automatically added tags . normal age / small friction means , the tags are inserted as inserted into the day XML files .
large / small detection of attributes : large / small volume of fixed attributes . normal age / small friction means that the attributes are inserted as inserted into the tag@@ .@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , is optional for tags , which is optional for the closing tag , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
Start@@ ing and closing tag automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic set of ac@@ cent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the respective coefficients during inclusion .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using a button standard , default values can be recovered .
standard character encoding : coding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files ( where the coding of file can be addressed ) , but this setting is put out of the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is put out of the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative backup ; creates a regular backup copy , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered . this is not the same as saving the file . even for even stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ et or its own View ( or the documentation in a cart@@ il@@ iter ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source text simultaneously .
set the default settings on the standard back when the user interface is useful when the user interface has come through changing the device modes and and@@ o@@ ats / depending on Vie@@ ws . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout guide parameters .
the haz@@ ard warning area serves the tax of the opportunity to check the ad from al@@ an@@ ks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the split mode . in terms of different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural building with the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of knots on tree can be set automatically and how deep in a change in the structure is set automatically , empty groups are the empty areas of the text , while empty groups that are not found in the current document .
the area for determining abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that are un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , which means that the i@@ f@@ one abbrevi@@ ation is valid as in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are K@@ part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug@@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to plug @-@ in , if it is not located at a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be plug@@ in to the plug@@ in when opening , so it can open the current file ( the path of the current file ) or the Project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using to keep the store . only @-@ reading box is usually ref@@ using to store the shop if this option is not selected .
review the plug@@ in : if this is activated , then tested &amp; quantitative information ; if the set information is correct . then select the saving of the order then , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which allows a variety of Im@@ pl@@ ement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ; in@@ quantitative .
use the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . use the options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; User Interface :
a view in which the content of over@@ turned variables will appear . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions listed are listed . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try requirements . this action is activated by default when a project is opened , which must not be respected in the normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ly Session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or end the leaves to meet the requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is equ@@ alled by using a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information about the over@@ heated variables and the current line . if this is happening , the execution is continued during the script , the script will start , starts the script with the requirement .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without information to over@@ flowing variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script has been given , the execution begins , as soon as a requirement is provided .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger will perform the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or include files .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger will perform the next statement in the script , with if possible in functions and include files .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go to the assignment and to go to the next so , when there was not the current one .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the revised value appears in the variation of the variable .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value for a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapted to your needs and help you to be able to get better .
documentation type Ed@@ it@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative languages ; they are used to provide support for marking and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility gives you a fast , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family options . tag folders are composed of two parts , the tag folders and the work@@ pieces . day folder are handmade , symbo@@ li@@ fied l@@ sten of image cr@@ ushing ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions are faster into a document when one user might ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . see detailed instructions for details .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ c ; and also work@@ pieces . short , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atured Vend@@ or ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even the tool bar permit a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a sp@@ elling .
tag folders are not as folder . you only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the restriction language and version , so present . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and clari@@ fies whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains no one element type above itself .
the Type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute value and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an element type element .
disc@@ usses the attribute of a tags . this element can only affect the name and the type of attribute . additionally , there is another tags which describe how this attribute will be displayed &amp; etc . this is a one element element .
returns the source code for the attributes in the day @-@ Ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and attribute on the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative data is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology within &amp; quantitative within &amp; quantitative . is used for the achievement of the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ological name . the arguments that may be handed over to the method can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
one box @-@ tag that sets the elements of a list together . it can only occur only once . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute value of a tags within a dialog box . this tag can only occur once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the given tags . this element is a one element type .
there is a list of elements that would end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to begin with a &amp; XML ; XML version : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be properly assembled and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not work , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog boxes is to start in &amp; quantitative . -@@ Windows to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following example for a family of 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this t@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP directive is described . the file name of these Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; subject &quot; type = &quot; tab &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly easy and there is a editor for that you can choose a list of selectable &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a new list of selected &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ c ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; quantitative information ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
a action can set actions with settings ... created . Click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this of this promotion is assigned a button . with clicking the button user , a button can be assigned to a button ; with K@@ one , the current key@@ chain is remote .
the sim@@ pl@@ est promotions . it can be entered in the detail settings and inserted when action in action , this text is inserted into the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the rapid start @-@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to find the % scri@@ pt@@ pt@@ est variable in the command line : global script : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative process ; only one instance will be replaced by the P@@ ID number . this is useful when the COP to control the control of &amp; quantitative . this is useful when the remote script is used by the remote script .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the enum@@ er@@ ated methods , a script from &amp; quantitative from &amp; quantitative . in the select box input can be determined what is to be send in the standard input . options are :
selected Text : the selected range of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this attitude .
accordingly , the output can also be re@@ directed to the output . there are two ways of issue : normal edition , written on the standard issue , error messages must be indicated by the standard output text by which the value is set to the standard output issue :
if there are many tags in the check @-@ in , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool is added , you must add actions and configure actions . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode .
fill in all required fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and if the tag have attributes and you can plan your use , activate a dialog &quot; Day , &quot; when available , allowing a check when using the action .
Ig@@ or ! is this a bad icon . who should remember the action in combination with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ e ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; select Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ills ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 pixels . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as less , star@@ ved , further interpre@@ ts ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alized , that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; -@@ day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it has to set up with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantitative counter ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box , press a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete this .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quantitative functions ; these functions are to be divided into several groups , or it should be shared by several separ@@ ator in several groups . make sure that the tool bar can be selected by set@@ ups . make sure that the required material is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
I want to use a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator does not support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ bate all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your work@@ pieces should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your own tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most desirable expansion of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentary tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . in the first part we let you let the second deal here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = Path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ ht@@ ml Section 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml ) 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml , 2 = Top 2.@@ ht@@ ml di@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml di@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml
the section of the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 , = Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic Use = Basic Use , ... Basic Use = Att@@ ach@@ .@@ basic syntax = ht@@ ml ...
please note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the boxes ( except of the mind ) md@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
you notice that the directory of the directory is refer@@ enced to a file ( and it is consistent at the top end of the section &amp; md@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
there are no spaces , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative &amp; quantitative .
the table section is the do@@ cr@@ c file which serves for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation here would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext List ) and the file connecting lines .
a simple list of cutting separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and easily save $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps for local and global use . then create a folder ( such as do this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) , in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these good and well are worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files containing a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to use the &amp; quantitative Act ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for the use by the &amp; quantitative . you will not be rich , but proud of being in the best web @-@ development platform .
with &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) using Email , tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , from where all other &amp; quantitative information can be reviewed and only available when our team is going to be correct and used to sign up a full post what it is ensured by a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , making it possible for our team as well as for later users .
when you upload , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can leave one input . in the dialog new resource , you need to continue to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can stay blank ) and clicking with OK it &apos;s upload .
the upload can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool @-@ mounted tool bar and will be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still prior to installation , it exam@@ ines the integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be stopped . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages which currently does not need to be created by using a D@@ T@@ EP package . the creation can be more elab@@ orate , because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag@@ .@@ It gives the easier way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD load and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ description which should be used , then the following dialog appears :
target templates : the new set &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder with this name .
! do@@ ct@@ ype Defin@@ itely : the string that is in ! do@@ ct@@ ype day , like HTML public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / V@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quantitative information ; by converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; text editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key@@ boards . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; quantitative information ; this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and quantitative .
this differentiation has been divided into three areas : global , locally , and projects . these differentiation affects a range of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quantitative structure ; it is all that is saved as a globally active folder structure of &amp; quantitative . this allows the group of administ@@ rators in different work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements make a personal collection of web development funds for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
the proj@@ ections are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ samples up to work@@ pieces especially for the files of a particular project . all elements are put into the folder tree of the project , which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window , the building prospects , the cart@@ il@@ it@@ res with info@@ s and the tool@@ bar . please beat in , and for more information about these areas .
in order to receive a context menu with the right button of mouse , you can receive a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all box @-@ re@@ iter , re @-@ load or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or design of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rec@@ tan@@ gles in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ section guide to another context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / input ) , editing the file under the mouse indicator or open the file if the string can be referred to a file under the mouse .
at the top end of the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ law , the tool@@ bar of the editor are currently taking action &amp; ht@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative data , the tool bar will be adapted to new features , and thus adapted user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert it in a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert the tag , then you can insert the data for this just added day . if you want to insert the data for this just added tag ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill up different fields in a dialogue .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and pass through the information on &amp; quantitative . it is available for files , project , sample templates , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that shows &amp; quantitative . this view shows all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as Hin@@ ts , remove , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on the &amp; quantitative area . global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more about templates is available .
here you can find information about the available script . the concept of the integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . more functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . through the left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it , man@@ oeu@@ v@@ attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks on the contents .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . it can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation of &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the quantitative documentation can be created , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be upgraded , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , via the useful information can be achieved : the message window and the problem window .
this cart@@ il@@ iter shows information about each in Qu@@ anta in running script . for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all changes to D@@ TD is displayed .
this box shows all errors in the process up of the current document . &amp; quantitative scripts that are designed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define your prec@@ epts as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
another function of &amp; quantitative information ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; G@@ mail ; . if they get a tool bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; quantitative .
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quantitative files . in order to get a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; quantitative data , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative F@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a large number of powerful functions .
during effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers started to deal with a stand@@ alone idea : what would be , if &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand @-@ alone , expand@@ able mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative . now on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you define it in &amp; XML , then it should be &amp; quantitative . it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above mentioned needs to be held that &amp; quantitative community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; quantitative community , which is based on someone else ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ our is not only this possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative information ; as they need it for their need .
&amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows users to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by clicking with this program , they can feel free to mem@@ ori@@ ze &amp; quantitative . ( more about it can be found in this way ) .
&amp; Qu@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has been expanded quickly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative . plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative . the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details about the details section is with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; type , or empty center help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developing and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ix sequ@@ enced @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time when you open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . if you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template &apos;s options , only a bug is reported .
converting when inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board , it contains special characters for &amp; HTML ; check , so that it is correct and not to be understood from the browser as a form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; check , which is the correct way to inser@@ tion of special characters and spaces in the URL ; s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors day .
switch the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; select button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages gives !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GU@@ I and pre@@ defined interpre@@ ts to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
spin and switch off the problem journalist in the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you are changing to the structural tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a single click .
if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or Next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other documents listed in the menu , based on the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens a existing project of the hard disk . &amp; quantitative F@@ us ; projects are saved using the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searched out the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables to copy the graphics files into your project folder or sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded another input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings as &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed to manage . chapter &amp; quantitative information is explained in the chapter &amp; quantitative .
load a tool bar . these will be kept in Project Teams / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialogue to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved by means of tool@@ bar code , or you are asked if you want to save the tool bar .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the field of view . it del@@ etes it not from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
so you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative view ; team , that the tool bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens up a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endix .
enables the upload of work@@ pieces on the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you have made or anyone else &apos;s and convert to the &amp; quantitative product ; own sign@@ ment format .
charging / refresh rates from the &amp; D@@ TD ; is sensible when the dis@@ advantages from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this is not present , without the entire &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is not present and write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the shop failed .
this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool .
allows access to the current day dialog dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ side .
activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this is only working with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quantitative assign to the tool , if this day is ref@@ using to contradi@@ ct the rules this day .
in the plug menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu items listed above . Click here to activate one activated plug@@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ onymous mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ es depends on the code ; -@@ version from .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms to the developers . select UNIX , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
review the syntax of the current document via selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of external use T@@ id@@ y .
an immediate shift between the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries it may cause some time to do or do good graphics . recommended is the card box mode , which is also the default mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes one entry for each open window . with a selection of a contract the corresponding window will be activated .
switches the status bar on the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative . main window , or out .
the changes in this dialog allows any application to use the K@@ HTML component , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
judge the behavior of Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ l . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add those who are changing .
that should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with every open source project , developers can always support help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative form in financial form , they can find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top left , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically completes . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project , e.g. fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative file ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the expansion web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file will be stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on adjustment of the remote computer could be needed .
this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it &apos;s a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool is stored for the project . it &apos;s a relative path to the project and by tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static content that you want to download and change it . for ser@@ a@@ script scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) must be different .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted . if a project is started out of the project , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all files and folders inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good che@@ que .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by phone or remove through removing the tick @-@ out clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants includes three settings to simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu profiles in the menu window profiles or with the key@@ chain Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be re @-@ ignored in real operations like some proj@@ ections of the project .
supplem@@ entary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project , which is loaded in the opening of the project , can be read more about proj@@ ec@@ ology .
this enables the de@@ bu@@ gging connection . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in this case , the error @-@ search can be described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a building view for each profile of the server by drawing a specific structure for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see for details .
in the Sub@@ scription event , one can change event actions , change or delete those actions , if a certain event occurs , such as the sighting of a file . see in the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens &amp; quantitative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , the last project which was opened . this behavior is currently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will be shown and allows the selection of a project . projects have web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us is activated , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative files are happening . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project programme gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
files are equally appropriate , however , the entries can be opened and open with ... compared to the right @-@ button @-@ button menu on the right @-@ click menu :
here you can search different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of highly appro@@ vals files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to remove removing packages .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgot your program . this option is useful when common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record -@@ option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; quantitative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; quantitative &quot; &quot; &quot; , a lot of high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server which should be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator , does not manage a service at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ ac@@ ce@@ threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it in your discretion . the password will be stored on the record , so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the plain text .
a projection view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply plug@@ ging of view , different files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar .
views can be saved in the menu Project or the Project tool@@ bar , accessible via set @-@ tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but allows also the adaptation of &amp; quantitative data ; at its own work mode .
as mentioned above are the tool bar in &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best about the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding differ . add the tool bar is treated at the bottom section of the tool bar below .
the tool bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by means of the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool bar ) , but other actions such as tool@@ bar can be set forth , work@@ pieces can be set down , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions are to be visible on this or other tool bar .
through the call of the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries can be removed and dis@@ assembled the entries to the self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and set actions ..
templates are used in essential documentation , code readers and files for linking . &amp; quantitative fil@@ en@@ us ; used templates as a blo@@ om file system with advanced organization and interfaces . we can copy , move , move any of the system existing directory within the template &apos;s template . templates have in &amp; quantitative . in about the limitations , which is suitable for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for use . please read the terms and conditions set before the start of any presentation .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; bin@@ aries will normally be inserted into documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures using IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / l ) . some examples can be found in the template &apos;s template under global template . additional information regarding the template is available .
documents may be given by each text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report can be found in appropriate boxes . a few examples can be found under global template . see for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area always will always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples can be found in the template &apos;s template under global template . see also for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , which is currently available in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a documentation structure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) , and select File As a template In local template ....
as soon as it happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see in the st@@ ump tree under proj@@ ections .
select text in your document and click on the File As a template of local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drawn with pulling and off on the template templates .
the compilation of binary templates is simple : the file will only be used in a template folder . it can be used all the file management functions for it , such as pulling and put or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the right and set up a folder template on a folder to a folder and to secure a name for the template , but of course it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very slow @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or dynam@@ ically associated with &amp; PHP ; arrange files insert or combine with them . in addition , one can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files used in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / share / apps / apps / Download / Download files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set up the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select the menu menu . the following dialog appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , Text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded , as soon as el@@ ter@@ nal attributes failed .
this is activated by default and fits for everything except for pedi@@ gre@@ e in the preliminary settings . if a regular folder would be enabled , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a pedi@@ gre@@ e folder .
allowed to prec@@ ede or later text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ lines for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a folder with special head@@ lines / foot lines an entire presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , we have a context menu ( show the right button of the button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; text editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which are accessed via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor does not work as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and reset the source code editor when the changes made in the V@@ PL ; text editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; text editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; text editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it &apos;s not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; text editor . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active , this mode is set to the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... It is possible to select between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be adjusted additionally . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for quick calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow speed .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so is the editing of the visible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also being created . this allows you to change this :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information on the document itself , e.g. key@@ words for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows the change of the in@@ hal@@ e , e.g. key@@ words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules using the buttons under the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as the Met@@ a Elements . the work of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sor is as described in a text processing , by reference to the arrows , possible . under rare conditions , the cur@@ sor lasts as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by sub@@ type , and be er@@ ased by pressing and return .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , such as the source text editor . it is necessary to note that the inser@@ tion of tags have already been removed already existing identical tags , e.g. a anch@@ ors day , surround with text , each other ambient anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists assist@@ ent are disabled . you will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to be used in this release , tables or lists tools .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ stic elements , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of sty@@ li@@ stic items can be persecuted .

there are many graphical tools to compare the same . why so &amp; diff@@ 3 ; please let me explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time correc@@ ting the back . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were many conflicts over mer@@ ging .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the positions where might perhaps only the inclusion of this changes was a small album .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of more useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ advert@@ ised file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merger is fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell Files primarily associated with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and mer@@ ging folder . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; when folders result :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s specific paint monitors . if you often have to check boxes , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tobacco are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , you can see that on a summary of the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble more if J@@ eller changes the back . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color shows which the file is different . red colour means that both are differenti@@ ated .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make sure that you can complete the file work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows the manual sub@@ type of fil@@ en@@ ames using file names , select a selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the list box . if you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files .
above the button folder ... you can also choose a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge folders will be introduced . if a file is selected , for B and C , but you use a folder , then use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; fil@@ en@@ ames using A in the two other folders .
if coupling is crossed , the input field is active for the goal and can process it . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file . you can also finish this step later .
the single button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before starting with the initi@@ als .
sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison starts instantly . in the opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select files simply using the shut@@ down button .
you can also drag and use them : simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall on a compar@@ ative window .
what idea is behind ? sometimes one file has several similar functions . if you like to find out what these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you need to add two appropriate files , simply add and compare these functions . now you can easily add the relevant sections , then compare and compare it .
note : currently , you can &apos;t pull out anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the closing of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpreted the drag and put text into another program as expres@@ sions and inser@@ tion ( instead of cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info @-@ line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( please note that windows C is optional ) . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse leave for a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to letters A , B and C . a color is blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you can see the color that file itself differs . if both files differ , the default color is especially useful when you compare three files . this is very useful when you compare three files . this is clearly visible in the next section ( merger ) .
in addition to the text there is a summary column . if the differences were found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + e.g. white signs only in strings and comments , for the processing unit and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line sequence is activated , the line will be packed with broken lines .
the result window ( below the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an Info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it does not contain text by automatic assembly , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the kno@@ bs of next sol@@ uble / odd conflict to find even the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative drivers are used , every difference may also be solved by a conflict of the manual .
by a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be selected and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this group will be highlighted by the beginning of the group otherwise . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current range and each on the left shows a black beam .
sometimes it remains of the automatic assembly or by manual Edit no further line left in the group ; then it &apos;s only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you will change your mind and perhaps again a different source . this text is neither written in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er you might easily copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; assembly Con@@ tractor ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options , ignore them or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs .
this will navigate to the keyboard , and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , page , end , C@@ tr@@ l at the beginning and C@@ tr@@ l as you can also be used by other programs . the over@@ loaded column next to the vertical image bar can be used by clicking here .
in the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ tion button , you can change between inser@@ tion and over@@ locking mode . ( default is the one @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the panel columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already discussed in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained .
the tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l bottom / C@@ tr@@ l above ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l bottom / C@@ tr@@ l above ) or to the next / previous conflict to be considered as conflict . hence , between sol@@ uble and un@@ redeemed conflicts must be distinguished .
in order to copy the cli@@ pp@@ ings in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the cop@@ ying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and write the manual cop@@ ying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a line @-@ set @-@ in characters \ \ and Win32 @-@ based systems use car plug @-@ in return \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ line of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start . ( menu In@@ scription - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a script with a fixed width . ( on some systems the scriptures must also be used with variable width to choose , you should not use it . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences will be displayed in cur@@ sive script . if the selected scripture doesn &apos;t support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ger@@ ated . on these systems , the default pre@@ ferences will automatically assign an un@@ matched color .
if this option is enabled , button 1 will inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
when entering or Return , the back of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy is then dischar@@ ged into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual range on the operating system used .
when the same files tries to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files . the second step compar@@ es any line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . however , the white signs will not be ignored .
some ed@@ itors ( on some systems ) save a car crash &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes in the side @-@ on @-@ side comparison , but even though they are different . if this option has been activated , however , this option must be disabled . during the merger , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored , but they will be treated as white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensively after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next odd conflict is continuing .
solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by pressing the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) It is useful if the automatic selection can also be saved in numbers or comments if the options suggest or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and run a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge guidance .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original is attached . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current program . you need to finish and re@@ boot the change . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set there on the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , the option will be used for all entries .
about the selection fields for encoding code appears a short notice which is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this is influenced to be treated as special characters and interpreted as the encoding for each file can be selected individually , even files with different coding can be compared and assembled .
if you have edited a file , you can define what encoding should be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could use 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the pre @-@ processing command can only define with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) Using this option , you can design@@ ate the coding of the output file .
turn this off to supp@@ ress any changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or reviews , if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences in a color @-@ coded over@@ si@@ est column are displayed . but sometimes you want to see the differences between two of three files . after a selection of A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ d ; C will be displayed next to the normal over@@ si@@ est column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available seat on the screen for long lines . write the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows by side or other . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . the current file will then run if you use only two files . if this function is used as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to run the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
reading a file , it is first delivered to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processing , which is exactly your requirements . you can use this function e.@@ g to cut inter@@ fere parts or to correct use .
reading a file , it is first delivered to this external command . if also a normal pre@@ processing command is given ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is used only when line . you can write your own pre@@ processing , which corresponds to your needs . each input line must have a line line .
the idea behind it is to enable more flexibility during programming of the di@@ ff results . but this is an external program needed , and most users wish to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line @-@ in order to change the input in major letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ . * \ 1 / \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ . * \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; \ 1 / &apos; .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some key@@ words to automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ st@@ itution ) . all follow the same sample $ key@@ word \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Auth@@ or \ \ _ Bau@@ r \ \ _ Bau@@ R _ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you might want to understand it and perhaps do not like these regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
the ignore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of a further pre@@ processing command for line @-@ off . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character is between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and every displaying is replaced by nothing , so it &apos;s deleted .
sometimes you want to perform several objectives at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l -@@ s &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / En@@ forcement / switches &apos; Aller@@ dings are different in per@@ l several details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data on the normal pre@@ processing unit will retain for viewing and maintain . other operations can only change the data that can see the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processing unit , the line @-@ line @-@ processing unit provides the output of the normal pre@@ processor as a input .
the pre@@ processing unit commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you could not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers often have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare yourself with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders to compare and merge .
... making any object a proposal to mer@@ ging ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes , without creating them ,
... guides selected actions either by all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are assembled , folder 1 will be used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , use the diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , do not run the merger , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress . if you remove the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed , which were compared to then .
when the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and any folder that was found during the scan , shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking on the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions with which you can open all folders - or fl@@ aps .
if you want to double click on a file , the file file is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other file , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object . in such a case , the con@@ jun@@ ct action can not be selected automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
however , the color is identical to identical entries , even if the age of entries are different .
folder will be regarded as the same when all of all the content is identical . then also folders have the same color . if folders is un@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if a does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no exp@@ editions have been given . then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the required action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical to : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file just B ; direct after the coupling &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are assembled , then select the option of reset file ( un@@ certain ) then the date of files and beats the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date must be identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ler cannot be removed , the merge of the folders can not be started .
while joining the other , a file is done after the other . status column shows Fer@@ tig , if the assembly occurred successfully , and according to other messages , if something unexpected was finished , you should make a last review and check whether the status is everywhere in order .
if a proper Analysis method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will only appear when compared to three folders . )
you can either lead the selected entry ( file or ox ) , or selected all entries at a time . if you have selected all coll@@ isions @-@ actions ( also in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in the Three folder association mode C will be used as the goal , when two folders have been selected and synchron@@ izing in synchron@@ ization A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries should be shown in the folder structure , too . there are some options available through the specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F6 .
if un@@ contra@@ dict@@ ory data types exist still un@@ iting actions , a message appears on the defective elements . they can then choose a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window with the options lead to perform Sim@@ ul@@ ating and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulation when you want to see what would happen to be done without the really changes . you get a detailed list of all promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is needed ( merge of a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( observe the screen photo ) .
if you are ready with a file , select a directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; diff@@ 3 ; his work continued with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will review some error messages which will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem before you continue .
if some entries have been arranged individually , this entries ( in the current session ) and performs it together with later . even if the compositions have been transferred or not saved , these entries will be considered as done . only if you change the merger promotion , these entries will be summar@@ ised .
the Settings menu from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) has now set up a section called directory association with these options :
only files that are displayed on the specified pattern is indicated in the Elem@@ ental tree . they can be entered in the Elem@@ ental tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that conform to this pattern do not appear in the Elem@@ ental tree . it can be entered in the element tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ding sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that conform to this pattern do not appear in the Elem@@ ental tree . it can be entered in the element tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ding sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading point is marked as a file . this option you can decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default value .
on links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic checks are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is switched on , the version will be switched on . if the option is switched on , you will not refer to possible records and recur@@ sively ( please note that this option would lead to a final grin@@ der and put down to diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is shut down in default .
leads a complete analysis of each file and shows the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of sol@@ o@@ ster , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster , only to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain degree of security . please use cau@@ tion . this option is activated in default .
similarly , does not take a real comparison . the files will be regarded as the same as they are equal to . this can be useful for example , if you have lost the change date . please use cau@@ tion . this option is activated in default .
activ@@ iti@@ oning mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of the combination of files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in default .
if there are differences , instead of a mer@@ ging copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it &apos;s the knowledge provided that the other file is not changed too . ) This option is shut down in any case .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also affect the normal result of individual files , not only the toge@@ ther@@ ing whole folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally the file association view does not become visible in the combination of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window / text windows to turn on the windows in the window menu and turn on to change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double click . however , you can also run a file menu directly without the folder . if you save the result , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged once you run the file .
this status is lost when you read the directory again : list -@@ menu : re@@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file using an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ oder . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ apped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , vac@@ ancy rate &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link displayed on a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no option to edit per@@ missions or change date . hence the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please read the option to the size of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently used as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first to start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse on the differences viewer and then select In@@ diff@@ 3 Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a K@@ part , take &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3 Part . please note that it does not work when any original files exists . Moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since production of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is executed as a part , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same from folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s comp@@ ile ) is already available . also the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already pointing out that way it can lead like the diff@@ 3 out of the di@@ ff tool collection .
I am using GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot about the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or let him go .
you have not compiled the program from the sources and configure the command pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure , do not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. at diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as the same , but if only one non @-@ white sign is treated , the line will not be treated as not the same . if necessary , next , next to each other than this is , this is is subject to the case .
the editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format which could save that information .
the cost for this was so far too big . you can always recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ch ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors for lifting differences . even more emphasis would be confused and missing the purpose . please do not use any other editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the website .
a list of recent changes will be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ all@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ all@@ Log in Qu@@ ell package .
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; mounted on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; used to comp@@ ile and install the command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ you gives the folder in your system , in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ certain you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . you should have difficulty finding problems , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists from it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or change@@ over ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or change@@ over insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current selection .
only differences show : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not therefore in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folders with the function of updates . )
there are only entries indicated which are differences . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merger . ( the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version probably . ) This option is shut down in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to modify the running programs on the surfaces , to modify it or move them . this works in a working area as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display any virtual working areas as well as in the current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; C@@ p@@ ager ; the motion is possible within a working area as well as other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked , if it is clicked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if you click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and exercise . commands are following :
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of the working area . only appears when it was clicked on one application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when an application was clicked on one application .
if this box is marked , Windows can be moved within &amp; C@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
if this field is crossed , the name of virtual working areas are displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual working areas are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working areas . if it is located along with the name , the names will be marked with a deposit , &amp; eg ; 1st working area .
if this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is also displayed as background in &amp; p@@ in .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed in order to allow the selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map . note : pixel map is just recommended for very fast systems .
here is the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window is well known : classic and k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers are known ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal and per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular in a vertical series , which is suitable for display on the side of the working area .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display windows as symbols or contents . it also runs outside the control bar .
clicking on the right mouse button within &amp; C@@ p@@ ager ; and after selecting a switch , you can set up the dialog for Settings .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen burning . you can use it with &amp; k@@ mag . if you are reading a magni@@ fying glass for the screen print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is designed for different users : these include artists , web @-@ designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that continuously expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ up computers .
if you like &amp; kiss , a window appears as shown above . in the following window , this window appears as magni@@ fication window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged section of the screen and is lab@@ eled as a select window .
in the default settings , enlarge &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse clicks is like a mov@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can see &amp; k@@ mag ; for this purpose , select a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( eg ; on the left side ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , please dial the mouse button . please note that it is still capable of recogni@@ z@@ able the shape of the mouse . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ l .
in the sel@@ ective mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move it with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you use the &amp; Shift ; button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can then send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start / stop the update of the ad . the stop of the update causes that the required CPU time runs against 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; used to store your introduced short commands to store files , opening a new window , prints , ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the button document again at &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and Ver@@ c@@ lei@@ c &amp; etc ; .
it may also be known as &amp; col@@ lo@@ fier ; you can use a screen size to enlarge it as if you use a magni@@ fying glass in a newspaper or a photo . this application is designed for different people of use : from the research and artist to Web@@ designer or disabled .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ l is waiting for a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive @-@ strain syndrome ) and each mouse click is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse suff@@ ers for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who are ic@@ ul@@ ously preparing pain . furthermore , it may em@@ ulate the pulling @-@ up with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can get the pain , which arises with the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from pain when using the use of your computer , you should search a doctor if this is not done .
to clari@@ fy it , even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , it helps to avoid pain in the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can fall for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click , once you break the movement .
if the smart di@@ ver has been activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it &apos;s pressing the mouse button is waiting until the end of the motion . in this way , you can run the pulling out of the mouse . in this way , the smart phone requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement you have to go , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click guides you .
if smart is switched on , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated , the time is adjusted , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the supp@@ ress of the mouse there is waiting before the mouse starts again , if there is no problem for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports a click on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move on the left and return a double click . this moves will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes .@@ t@@ xt for the first time , but they can be altered later .
when the sound is delayed , you can set &amp; k@@ de ; to make the reaction time to be shortened . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center , please go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the rider . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is tagged , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; starting at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ ina ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other windows environments , please insert the respective documentation to figure out how you get there a program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values that have been set when opening the dialog box . if you have already pressed the button , the settings are reset on the status after pressing the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent move , you should initially be switched off when you click the automatic mouse click , you can get the intelligent shifting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that doesn &apos;t show a link , does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can use the mouse in such places until you want to use it .
if your mouse is sealed , you should clean your mouse . it is normally fairly easy . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse balls , but also the rolls that enter in touch with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse balls . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear , if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the reels . these are located on the sides of the floor , into which the ball was used . the trick and contamination you can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations the operating system does not break the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use an shooting down . if you use it in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can &apos;t stop by the drawing of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to carry out the cur@@ sor over a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but if you don &apos;t want to bring your mouse on a neutral area of work area , if you don &apos;t want to bring your mouse clicks . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ b are &amp; eg ; gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to use the smart phone , but I do not create it to edit this text .
the smart di@@ ver is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it into the cli@@ p@@ board , to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move it again . but there will probably be problems for them . here are some advice about it :
use the smart di@@ ver not only when you start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead like this : perform a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and put the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . so , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button is played like a mouse click . so you know exactly what to use the smart phone . later you can use it without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
in order to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must have the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; which should be installed on most of the system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; provided the mouse button on the mouse as soon as the mouse indicator has been developed . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to those who are the killing of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a particular time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse starts . in this way , the pulling and end up with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program to allow the m@@ ute users to talk to their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; m@@ ute users can talk to the computer for themselves . users can choose from a list with the conversation propositions which are to be spoken again .
on the first side of the Assistant ( lin@@ kes screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book manual . you can choose the text file formats you can choose to choose , without need to type . the passages can be edited .
on the third side ( right @-@ screen photo ) determine the dictionary of the chosen language . &amp; k@@ mouth . read the voc@@ als documentation of the chosen language , in order to determine the frequency of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ Dic@@ tionary so that only the not@@ orious words are absorbed into the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly confident and essentially contains a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ation of your propositions ( the lower white field on screen photo ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the registry . they can select from it propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up your dialog box dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two card cards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ lds , as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the box language issue , enter the command to call the language Generator . in the box below the input field you specify the character encoding using the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard entry to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to the language output from your language generator will depend on this command to your language generator . you can find examples in the app@@ endix .
use as a language course as a language course . if this is successful , the text of the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for language output is currently being developed . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection of text after the selection of a text passage you determine which action by selecting a text passage in the text@@ box menu or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ box menu or in the l@@ ath for text packs .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the registry . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered into the input field .
using the second selection box closing of the processing holder for text agen@@ das , you can define whether the text@@ book repair manual should be stored at the closing of the machining window .
with the selection of text permission book , the book is saved . if you have made changes , the text file is not saved . select before saving , it will be saved and k@@ mouth ; ask if the text file is stored .
the page Wor@@ lds contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select field if this list contains more than a dictionary . using this select box , you can choose the currently used dic@@ tion@@ aries for word .
with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name in the input field and set the language for the dictionary .
for this source you select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; reads the frequency of the single words simply compare with the count of each words . in addition , you can compare the word list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary that just add true words to the new dictionary .
this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which Dic@@ tionary has led together , and how they are weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered the dictionary automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary that plays a dictionary that is currently using your voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
the main area of the window for the processing of text @-@ matching trays is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the size of the text plates are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cuts . if you have chosen a text file book , you can change only their name .
actions such as new Text passages or books Add or selected passages and books , you can either go on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ words or tex@@ pas@@ sions can be changed by pulling in the mouse to the new job or the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt @-@ button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the running storage .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the running storage .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected propositions of the running storage .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ pping tool is indicated by buttons for frequently used commands . by mouse click on the left hand side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another point .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts above the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , it is displayed by slide glasses with entries directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the left hand side and drag the tool can be moved to another point .
probably you have the command for the language output not correct or not fully entered . open settings like settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the language issue on the card output issue . ( see the dialog for Language synth@@ es@@ izer for further details ) .
Festival is a language output system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the licence allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / us@@ r / local / festival . the command to the language issue is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an independent voice generator . currently , it supports only the English language . currently , it supports only the English language . the licence allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ ighter to create the command line with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to send data as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license is allowed to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / local fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to add the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign needs to be added . the full order is therefore more efficient than in the other examples :

the Language dem@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language services that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various languages output systems .
since setting the Language Bu@@ ilder only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language course as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally the memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people that can &apos;t talk to output text by the calcul@@ ator . a list has already been saved , which the user can always re@@ produce again .
please note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synth@@ es@@ izer . on the computer , a language synth@@ es@@ izer must be installed .
detailed user@@ documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or run it to help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one from modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; button ; is a particle system in &amp; k@@ de ; the language output ( T@@ TS ) is ready to provide a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . users also offers interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications is embedded .
the language output is done via the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher programme , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of Language issues on the command line ( or with Shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Support program .
in future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GU@@ I ; for configur@@ ing and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ meter in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
one module for text editor &amp; K@@ ate , with which a text file can be read completely or in part .
in addition to Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you will find the list above h@@ tt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ box / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . you can also find the developers in I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can install &amp; kt@@ on , you need to install the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program and adjust correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no spokes@@ person is set up , the card card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izers offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such a combination of language , synth@@ es@@ izer , voice , sex , noise and speed is known as speakers . you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used as the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same Syn@@ thes@@ izers are comparable with several printing @-@ anticipated long for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ el card reader in kt@@ on , the card card is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start t@@ ar , and yet no spokes@@ man is set up .
all available actors appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the highest speakers will be used for the language output when there is no spokes@@ person for one application .
in a click click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of speakers in the list determines their priority .
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; ct@@ ts ; system .
choose a vote here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and women &apos;s voice .
Click here to click on the new spokes@@ person on the map tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click here .
now you can use &amp; t@@ ts . go back to the map card General and check if language output is enabled by clicking the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; check box to read text . Click on the card card orders to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language selection system from &amp; k@@ de ; Click on the card box in General to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is the start of the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can set up text orders and continue reading . see , remove the selection , K@@ TT@@ SD will hold and off the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
once a t@@ ar is terminated , le@@ ct@@ ts ; further , if the box language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this box is marked and kt@@ t@@ meter appears automatically in the system area of the Control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is finished .
using the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop and take up again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; add @-@ in writing or a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
Click on users or OK , then all modified settings will be taken on all sides .
the card card is displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card box in General and enabling it to activate language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; if you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text you should read and select the main menu templates . after a short time the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; ht@@ ml ; previous lines and other in@@ visible brands are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed ; check first if &amp; t@@ ts . if you check the text , which should be read from , and select the main menu templates . then the language output should start .
this also works when &amp; K@@ ate is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; it is informed about you specified events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; ct@@ ts ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message if you arrive in a I@@ RC channel , in which your nick@@ name occurs . you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu of this program . here possible adjustments for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter for drawing sizes provide a good way to correct &amp; ct@@ ar ; it is a good example . you remov@@ es the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and moreover the expression / local / In@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filter are one of the advanced skills of &amp; ct@@ ts ; it is not necessary for normal work with &amp; ct@@ ts ; filter are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before he is sent to the program SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a matching language and speakers , or in order to handle certain defic@@ ien@@ cies of language synth@@ es@@ izers and their votes .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; different types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be applied to all other contracts , and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen Reader is pre @-@ read , they will continue to be held .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
News have the next sign @-@ highest priority . a message is subjected to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . while you &apos;re writing a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth . please welcome someone who just entered the room . &amp; kiss ; -@@ al@@ er@@ ts are also news . read about this news .
the rest are easy text @-@ up . each job you specify from the card card orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text applications . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that do not have special rates .
all four order sub@@ types are processed in queu@@ e , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ read , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen resolutions . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and continue it on the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
drawing puzzle replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which will enable by text or as regular expres@@ sions such as : - ) by text or for the outline of messages from &amp; account ; or &amp; mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ops are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can print jobs according to the content of the text or depends on the program , which the text on &amp; ct@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it .
each of these different filters are adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a language output . if the filter determines that its rules cannot be found , he continues the text unchanged at the next filters .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; ct@@ ts ; is sent by all activated filters , which were set up on the side down . the process is carried out in the order in the order from top to bottom .
this indicates the list of fully functional filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in the range from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the following layout di@@ alogues .
if you want to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern , the text will be replaced by the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated spare text . large and small obli@@ que will not be respected when compared with the comparison .
in your filter , enter a name for your filter . you can choose any other name , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
Click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is applied only if the speaker is a text@@ book that speaks a registered language . Click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also hold several languages if you click on the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comp@@ mat@@ a . for example : cont@@ ation , k@@ mail
application @-@ ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be we@@ ed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 is required , you can only enter copy .
the character string filters will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box . if all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to other words , the character string filters are used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing off regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; configur@@ ing the &amp; k@@ de ; text editor &amp; # 160 ; printing &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such conversion . but it can only be used to be well @-@ shaped XML . the device program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , even x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker running filter you can send texts to a specified speaker , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . you can define that texts by mail from a female voice can be read from a female voice .
before &amp; button , there is a spokes@@ person for the text , it is looking for a speaker for the text . it is written by speakers that select the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends out the properties available on the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker . with the speaker label you can write the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered , the filter is applied , if the text has the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; configur@@ able , you can call it with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to give the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
insert here the properties of your desired speakers . if the text has been fulfilled above the specified filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements at the bottom . Click on the right button to view the dialog for Spe@@ aker selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your speakers or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box this filter if you need at least a condition .
the language API , of &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer use their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synth@@ es@@ izer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that we can use this synth@@ es@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of the language API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / ) bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications and language @-@ use via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
this is the text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can apply . for a list of all commands you will
open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . start the c@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language synth@@ es@@ izer is supported by my language . where can I get a synth@@ es@@ izer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; file extension , but when using the module for Festival , web pages are not read .
due to a bug in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the vote ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able ever works . that &apos;s why you do not have to use this voice to read out web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synth@@ es@@ izers , so that all propositions over@@ spr@@ ints or just chew@@ ing wel@@ s . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the option is set to the appropriate value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a character string filter . see .

the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; ct@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets and the development @-@ files for the program &quot; SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source codes from &amp; ct@@ ts ; you have downloaded from the source tex@@ tual archive for k@@ de@@ fer , or have downloaded the program currently created in any night and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if you use SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language synth@@ es@@ izer . you can use the SPD @-@ conf script .
&amp; button ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is used to develop the program SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program t@@ ms@@ v@@ aim is to be developed in such a way that the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly available and the script SPD @-@ conf is not needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual propositions . the user can return spare or cover , repeat , or break the output .
if an application contains text on &amp; ct@@ ts ; for example , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have a speaker with English and whose sex is female , this will be automatically used by the best matching speaker . if you choose to know more , like &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker has chosen you will see in .
if you click on the card reader for adding a speaker into the list or click on Edit menu , the card card reader is shown . as an example , the module of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . for details on the module you will find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path comes to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter a festival .
select the character encoding for text , which will be handed over to Festival . if voices , the &amp; ct@@ ts ; it is generally considered that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 is used to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ( ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 ) .
with these sli@@ ders you represent volume , talk speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a knob , and these grey , the chosen voice can not be selected by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded with several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first movement is faster synth@@ es@@ ized .
if this box can &apos;t be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to user reviews ) .
if this box is marked when starting from kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , after the start , the symbol of the tool is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this box is marked and w@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thereby you have the possibility to read or control the pre@@ ference .
here are all the orders placed on the queu@@ e , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose a full range in the order , which is selected or return in the list below or return . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and t@@ w@@ t@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . Click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here are only text applications listed and managed . issues of screen resolutions , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . additional information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops are available .
choose the kind of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; ct@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , compiled &amp; ct@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are selected in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
set the ch@@ ap speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X needs to be installed .
Click on users to take on the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices contains all PCM @-@ Devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt you can choose standard .
on this map card you can set special promotions that will always be executed if the text order of a message is interrupted by higher priority . &amp; ct@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be issued to all other contracts and will keep these orders . after the output of the screen Reader was read , the displayed orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have a priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts ordinary text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &apos;re reading &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be accessed using &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless we welcome you that enters the room just .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , add &amp; ct@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e is required .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card is only valid for normal text applications . for messages , al@@ arms and issues of screen @-@ Re@@ aders there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; ct@@ ts ; check K@@ Noti@@ fy messages . start and click on al@@ er@@ ts and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the ticket en@@ quiries appears .
select this check box in order to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and le@@ ct@@ ts ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use this buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event that you want to add to list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; cont@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in an I@@ RC message to your nick@@ name .
all events that are otherwise stated in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops .
use this select box to specify what &amp; ct@@ ts ; do if an event hits . you have the following selection possibilities :
if you have chosen custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed in the list box spokes@@ person on the map card as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a certain event is set up for a specific application , this action will run . otherwise , the action is set up for all other events of the particular application . the last possibility of action to tra@@ ps under standard ( all other events ) was set .
the event all al@@ er@@ ts for application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can define the al@@ er@@ ts al@@ er@@ ts as follows :
use the button to save the settings for the al@@ er@@ ts in a file . use the load button to run stored settings from a file . if you want to start using a blank list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries , except all discrimination devices will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ drome Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to select text for a language output . this standard includes stamps for the control of voices , speaking speed , the sound of voice and sound . also marks for the control of the language of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently it supports &amp; ct@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start in single sentences , as only the first proposition must be synth@@ es@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or stop or stop , even if the language synth@@ es@@ izer is not supported directly .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . during the first start of &amp; ct@@ ts ; it is automatically set up for a set of limit@@ less filters . you can modify the settings or further pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter , however , it will not use it .
in the sim@@ pl@@ est you will learn the establishment of speaking selection by clicking on . switch on the ticket selection , such as speakers &amp; kt@@ ops , select a few features and check out how the speaker can be changed . to this , you must of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; button ; then faster with the pre@@ reading , since only the first sentence can be processed , and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you will then be able to stop or break text orders on the card card , even if the language synth@@ es@@ izer function does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal rate of proposition is automatically set up for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only removed . do not change anything in this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ulated mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter ret@@ ains the character .
S@@ BD Filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ills ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen resolutions .
if you are able to remove the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter , you can insert it again by using the file standard _ s@@ dr@@ c using the file standard _ s@@ dr@@ c .
on the card reader you can write the speaker settings for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words , no spokes@@ properties will be specified .
use the matching speaker , which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; ct@@ ts ; the speaker looks , which corresponds to the originally introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property has to have priority over other features . you can also bet several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the issue is , it will be rarely used as a priority feature . if you would like to specify this property . if you want to specify the attribute if you need to specify a certain application text in another language when working in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speakers , which is most likely to delete the text , click on the select button standard speaker and then click on speakers which corresponds to the most common .
in this case , 0 is available for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ p is immediately off when it started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; ct@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command station register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can attempt to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install .
the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play with another application music . if I keep a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message that says : vol@@ to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts have to occur in AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ i does not show this voice .
insert the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can also serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio , there is a setting speed . that this works , the program SO@@ X must be installed and can be found via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ izers , as Festival Interactive , offer an adjustment for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored , if &amp; extract ; ( this is that the HTML can be converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML Shift .
I do not create it that websites can be read with a female voice . I set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . so it does not produce any mistakes , the X@@ SL file makes the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML . the same applies also to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a single character string filters and now I can finish in &amp; kt@@ ops ; not more full @-@ purpose or return . on the cart@@ il@@ iter orders , the order will only be taken from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
Inter@@ point sign ( point , question@@ ing , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) cannot filter it . use this character instead of a filter to pro@@ positi@@ onal detection .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .org )

some users can experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts to play music and read the text you can start playing a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support real breaks . if you keep a text order in &amp; ct@@ ts , the current proposition is still read @-@ in .
the SO@@ X audio program is used for general attitude of speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; downloaded as a normal user and un@@ zip the cam@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least on request .
the following modules for language synth@@ es@@ izer will be created as standard . some of them have a running dep@@ en@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Guidel@@ ines of Deb@@ ian Distribution ) . ( not @-@ free according to the Guidel@@ ines of Deb@@ ian Distribution ) , the configure parameters will display the configure parameters which causes the over@@ flow of the order .
as default , it is installed and posted in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify an option --@@ pre@@ fix = finish . for example :

before you can use it , check first if your language synth@@ es@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with Syn@@ thes@@ izers .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izer , whose source code is open . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . with many voices you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . help to get to the instructions that are delivered with festival . would you like to read out websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in a festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you have set up the Russian voices you need to enter for the Vo@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution options are available as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding needs to be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding needs to be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; Syn@@ thes@@ izer . then this festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ics analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; program and the mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; no complete language output system is . &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated language of Di@@ ph@@ on files . it provides additional software to create these slides . festival creates this by &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the necessary di@@ ph@@ on@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found below .
in this case , additional W@@ ra@@ pper code is added to Festival , to use &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ votes to the voice synthesis ; -@@ x@@ ing files do not be installed in &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; folder will not be installed , but in the folder / li@@ b / . instructions on the web site .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ centre ; that allows the administration of the network interfaces , routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by K Menu k@@ control@@ center ; can be called ..
the &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the administration of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the user a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; shown . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical tools and their driver must already be functional and configured to do so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device shows at all and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases device drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnishings . network devices are added later , the drivers must be charged by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded if the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ index will be selected . when starting the module network settings , this system will automatically detect the system using the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the suspension choice is offered . it &apos;s the platform to choose the distribution and the release of the best . by selecting the adjustment Not @-@ again , the defin@@ ing can be taken permanently . when next start of network settings , this selection will automatically be pre@@ set automatically .
the change of network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are grey , which means that the settings can be considered . in the system management mode , you enter the system management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the full functionality of the module is available in system management mode . these are divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is designed to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks are to be performed :
the settings of the selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up a set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button , click the dialog with further improvements .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , no further settings are required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address you need to set the required TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask , the network mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system draw the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog will appear as the properties of the device in the device box .
it should be sure that the IP address of the network is not already used in the network . ping to a TCP / IP conflict with ping at &amp; console ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs , or switched off or switched off . switching from the list and click to activate interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . set off the activated network unit by selecting the list and click the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected as a network where the gateway is the gateway computer .
a computer with DNS support replaces the respective IP address . this is necessary to understand the computer only IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls for the DNS &apos;s name to an IP address such as approximately 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ ri@@ an name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or altered .@@ DNS entries can be up by selecting a contract and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons , or download it in the priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group of calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added to the name of the new name server .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button adding . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the group of calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ esp@@ ace , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be displayed the dialog .
the list of familiar computers describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address of the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boats when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks can replace the DNS server .
normally the list contains several entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported , and there is still some special IPv6 addresses in the test .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog for New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button adding . if the well @-@ known machine has several ali@@ as names , de button adding several times and enter another alias name .
select an name of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog will not be displayed .
it can run one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings specified in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to activate the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of the binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it reaches when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s just download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with gra@@ zing surface as a package or the installation tool for their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands ought to make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; respon@@ sive configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information on the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been found that it is expected to be in the near future . these description are therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to assign IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator , which will be available to a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can &apos;t be selected as desired .
when using a own small ( home ) network , IP address should be chosen from a specific purpose for this purpose to avoid IP address transactions with the global Internet ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore their arbit@@ r@@ ary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be set up for such machines due to the attitude of Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the field is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is needed for the IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised , if in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as defined .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts to the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand as expected .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ formed &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; dat ; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to put several archives on a band . the second goal was to put a surface for t@@ ar , the second goal was the responsibility of a question that my wife introduced : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it has to be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; spin the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the gu@@ er@@ aman in the band will not be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the fore@@ man , searches after the appropriate index on your disk . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
in front of the end of the tape , first binding has to be solved first . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; there is a change to the symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be cast out without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it is necessary to be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; being format@@ ted .
a band species must be format@@ ted before being used to store data . this process does not conform to form@@ att@@ ter with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be format@@ ted before use by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; however , floppy disk drives usually have to set a form of belt drive , DA@@ T drives on the other hand .
after entering the band called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ age the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you cont@@ ag@@ ate the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only receive this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
Click with the right button of the mouse on the local file tree and choose from the Menu bar ...
once the f@@ use was introduced , the dialog for backup will open . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears for backup . the dialog displays the progress of the securing process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . it will only be the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a tick . there will only be the marked files and / or sub @-@ folders .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Review Settings . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears to verify the progress of testing process as well as the rate of data and the remaining time .
before you can run the restore , the files you need to be recovered . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry level . it will only be selected to select the selected file or folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be recovered as selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
please click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the files and select it in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Settings appears on restore . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the work@@ folder for the restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears again . this dialog reveals the progress of recovery process as well as the rate of data and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two ways of the belt :
this is a backup profile with the just marked files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , it is true that only the files can be secured on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can add separately under backup files . each entry will be viewed from t@@ ar independently from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files backed since then have changed since then .
the name of the file that used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all the files will be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; pla@@ gued ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the full path for the belt drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat , before the band is attached to the drive . in some drives this is necessary to run before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the output of the tape drives are un@@ lock . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast the tape off . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ ship block size can be changed for the tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to do &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size will share for your band .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format is format@@ ted , writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file sets together as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is the host name : seconds , with the host name of the full name of the system , on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to be used with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ dat file folder .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar archives that can be manage directly to &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as they do not have in@@ cre@@ denti@@ ality .
try the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables you to get information about your system . furthermore , it enables quick access to information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ end@@ log ; experienced users the fast access to the example of information on their server . &amp; ks@@ haft log ; thus trying to provide some extended functions , with their help the protocol files can be filtered and analysed .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ haft log ; a number of useful features . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the other chapters of this hand .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ haft log ; functions are available , with the help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start is trying to open &amp; ks@@ ha@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system is not displayed , so you have started &amp; ks@@ haft log ; very likely you do not start with system administrator . the protocol files are usually normally in / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have author@@ ization to read .
you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter according to a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to a selected string . in the default setting , the selection box contains just displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns indicating the string search term .
you can also select another entry at this point . select the string of the filter search term then only with entries in the correspon@@ d@@ ingly selected column . select an example in the filter bar the name of a process , so displays you &amp; ks@@ and@@ ing log ; all the protocol lines , which were sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error are displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of Level Note . the color display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in system Protocol or in the cr@@ on Protocol ) , then you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to view all the new protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; allows the display of several protocol @-@ files in separate differences . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage additional windows . once you have selected a window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; has a own website at h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ haft log@@ .@@ forum software software . here you will find more information about the subscription sources of &amp; ks@@ haft log ; .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; you can also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archive : ks@@ haft log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program at the high level of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go to historical aspects here ( among others because I know nothing knows : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ aries is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone may try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without creating a new installation and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc are instead of directly into / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service which you would like to start on another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; system services does not include such things like set@@ serial that only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is not much use for this . you can also get a r@@ c.@@ serial to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel searches at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and do the 3 . if you have some point out , then get it repair by using the system and execute the following :
but how do you get all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that no real files are found in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the following command line :
this would stop the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will hit with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people wish you a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could have a server running , that only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ ners , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so easy @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is easy to say not tri@@ vial : simply pull one entry out of the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level in order to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ as or change the position within a level by changing it . thereby , the entry will be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they draw an entry from the range of availability services .
note : entries will be postponed when you pull them into a new range . in order to select it except for a new run@@ level , you need to select explicitly from the menu menu or choose from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of a single entry can be no calcul@@ ates . in such a case , you will have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no option to restore records that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the various working areas ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another run@@ level , use it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
in order to modify the sorting number or the name of a single entry , press the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu may require a confirmation before it executed .
all settings will be saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they are recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pre@@ ferences are saved in a local sy@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type of system services to be launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration of proprietary programs in the distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) are simply finished without the message if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you &apos;ll need to save them . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window is composed of two card cards , the user &apos;s and user @-@ group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user or special features .
some cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) , a card card will be generated if you make individual settings . additional card cards appear if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card statement appears if shadow pass@@ words , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix .
this card card will only be activated and initi@@ alized for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) , and is recogni@@ z@@ able ( identi@@ fiable at the file as a.@@ user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , for each user parameters can be changed , with limited liability of information in KB are :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field of file system .
the card@@ boards must be informed about the user &apos;s pol@@ arity . the standard group where the user belongs , you will find in the Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding from the user or group or click the matching add @-@ button to the tool bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the time up to boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change and learn more .
