<seg id="15">At & fswald; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in this way. according to that, you can easily be detected in the folder hierarchy. according to that, & fsview can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fswald; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. to simplify navigation, have the rectangles of meaningfully color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle that is switched over colour mode can either display depth for the slight detection of the casing pipe or the picture of a different file size such as name, owners, group or MIME-type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be used with the various features of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can define it, only if enough space is present on display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore, there may be the relative position of the label in the rectangle below).</seg>
<seg id="19">At Daremap algorithms for Treemaps, the area should be kept proportional to the size of the entry. during the treachap in & fsview, this goal is not always adhered to, and that frames must be no longer available. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of a single entry for the subordinate text, the implementation is left untrue. here it is more advantageous to make sure that rectangles is created so that rectangles whether the best methods are square. the best methods of this respect are lines, columns or recruitment problems.</seg>

<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digiver; an open source project. that means, it is dependent on the support of Endanwens. they should therefore notify problems and improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digiver was trying to make sense of problems as possible for them. if you are in the program, the help menu contains one entry problems or wishes. if you are using this link, your web browser opens a page in the error report. all required information are already registered here. follow only the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicame; is a project which is supported by a community. so if you come to join a regular user from & digiver. if you are interested to answer any other users of & digigiants; and hopefully you would like to answer any other user questions. however, in this mailing list, however, you should be powerful.</seg>

<seg id="66">Later you can add a lot of folders like you want to add. & digiver, you will also use as an Albenevolve library. settings of digion to set up collections.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a photo collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images provided as base folder. & digiver; viewed every sub-folder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search for the folder you will receive a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiver; durations come out to the librarian in its whole depth. you can choose no subfolders, unless it is hidden in hidden files. you can then finish in an outside folder and add a point in front of the name of the chord.</seg>

<seg id="75">& digiver. uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has an constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and transfers through serial port is slow. & digiver. supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. you will find a complete list of supported cameras below this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be read with libexif support, the precaution can be read by some libgphoto2 camera channels, if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you could see any look, or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digiva, is how easy the functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you need to maintain any thing into your system. your image files must be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether others want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network operator & etc. note that you have to change it sometime to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found via your location. if you have enough photos, you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of the archives and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files do together? the separation of file types makes the stacks easier. separate new files of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or an initiated picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option on the site of metadata in & digiver. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC-data can be found in the file. if you forget it, then you can save the metadata from the database to select the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">You have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? for this purpose a metadata editor is available for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select every photo keywords, labelling and assessment. of course, you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute. they start the best with the evaluation or the ranking. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now take keywords, keywords, as you are often called on other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogised images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree will insert the images to the right spot. the changed keywords inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub-tree to another. the modified keywords are being pursued by & digiver; updated while the subtrees pursues.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to PA or comments, the third major tool to catize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most niemy your photos simply only, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. when you look closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing station of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed their perception of this panoramic position.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other those pictures, the title is possibly more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you are showing images, it's the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help him about the motif that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is OK. if a picture is not perfect, if it is the strength only with one label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiver, you can also expose a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can use it for a selection of images. if you want to export your images in web galleries, you will need to tell you the story so for the opening of a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? as you had to find in a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth Earth? good, because with pictures, the train is driving the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities the geolocalization can be extended already in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily exporting your travel with geo Earth. you can also export the pictures at the recording place. you can also export the pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in any modified versions, thus also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the setup page of & digiver; information should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographers, for example, if it is not desired to protect the identity of photographers, then the name of a company or organisation can't be changed. after that, it should not be changed once. this field does not support Commas or Semikolons as a dividing character.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autocation (Synonym for Disassertion): is associated with the author. this field contains the work drawing of photographers. examples of this study can be title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the car field, this also must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the Anbieterfeld to identify the picture. this must not necessarily be the author. if the picture is working here as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / Agency will be given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse, or change it. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important against it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiver. in the near future we will present such a module for forklifts.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate errors, turnouts, electric power, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same as you can also happen at traditional paper photos or Negative. in this section it concerns problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery in the world, has some interesting statistics what causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem of CDs / DVDs that you need to fight it more than a few years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course you can also download CDs and DVDs. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you think this is in your measurement space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be disreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording applications and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. therefore it turns to the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to protect themselves, even if you just have just been written. therefore, they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we require for the formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they need them by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favourable program called IsoBuster that works on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but also similar applications are not available for Macs. there is also similar applications that read the damaged data of damaged disk drives, hard drives, flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is said to CDs and DVDs are also applied to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device in a non-quality media. read the media with a description, date & author mark and then place on a clean, dark dry and protected site protected site. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of media or software to read this media or software.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for itself. your manufacturer has guaranteed a new disk, but not the data. Google is available to this topic a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief, Disks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature differences, the most common troubleshoists are disable. these are especially reading errors and deposits. these are especially reading errors and deposits. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">Here is the complete loss of losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also handle data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses are usually again made without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electrical equipment, these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious loss of data loss, hardware failures, destroying motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself from the inevitable time to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of the energy storage absorbs and the rest. it is normally made in the form of a wall bar. remember, however, it is not an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning and thereby protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also consider that even all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage supplies which can also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">When you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for on the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection of your system can be used for smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will help you to result in a complete loss. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbearable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting prestresses, these devices can provide automatic battery energy when a power failure. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and automatically work up to the current. if you have a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current problems with costs for avoiding these. a high quality voltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you are aware of your computer. at the end, you should always remember all cables to connect before you drive to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use this as the drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives, it is very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. furthermore, you have to send the data about comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suited as solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo Community 23hq.com will provide online memory services on photos stored on photos. your free variant is available to you for more than $25 per year. you will receive unlimited storage in case of Flickr. for $25 a year you will receive unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large firms in the offer a backup and a partial memory. so they are Desired.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain on the machine. all transmissions are due to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs represent at least the data integral between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when it happened in your hardware. all these disruptions remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought to have thought. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission ratio as they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not concerned about transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates to be able to handle and scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is also available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workplace systems. in case of notebooks it is already the proportion of theft.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most chisels. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; so far no longer have been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file system. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems avoid corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during a surgery is higher and a non-defined status is avoided before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2-stop settings of fundamental physical borders. there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution already has to deteriorated. a sensor size of 6 megapixel and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive provides you today for 100 & euro; so you do not get any other data loss for data loss. so you get your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, replacing the exchange of records or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you have to make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you have happiness when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strike locally, and destroys a lot. forget the disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and steels are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastervora always means a local store. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighbouring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for a loss of data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not available immediately, you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files are to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generate a full snapshot at two points: to the complete assurance and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. generate several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time again. this backup comes to a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only handled and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily copied to your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync copies only the difference of files that really have been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure an important pictures directly after you've saved them on your computer on a DVD or a different visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will give you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional lesson should be done manually after which you have made a complete verification.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC files, associated XMP files, original store, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">This valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be looked at:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature it is said to be careful and re-rate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to use as the current system backwards. the less variants are in the past, the more easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your image, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you want your machine architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and you need to convert your library if necessary, please stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional printing process for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually a bit larger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have already planning the scalability with a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Verify the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of the plate in MBO; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if there's no software any software you can read it, then you can create these themselves. this task becomes easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard, but it can save much more. it's fun free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC-data for an improved color instruction for heterogeneous platforms, but not as many as TIFF needs and does not have a slow compression. this format will we recommend to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed format or stored in a container with a fun free compression compression. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted for many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope that the competitors can use Canon and Nikon also sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why to replace Adobe his XML-based XMP technology; a blend of XML and RDF. it is a label of XML and RDF. it is a label of XML and RDF. the file information is provided with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it off the original of your recording, mostly in the raw file format. but it can come to problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as above mentioned above, you should remember whether you use DNG as container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metmetata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI co-communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transfigured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera ridium, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your Rohanv. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing, you can use external programs. if you come back with & digiver, then you should add the metadata back. these were cut off under circumstances among other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiver. in section adding a photos to an album you can add a description, as you can already add to your hard drive. but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbendatenBank.</seg>
<seg id="249">In order to use your digital camera with & digiver; simply connect this with the machine, switch the camera on the display mode and turn it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, the filenames will appear at the bottom and the preview photos of all photos on the camera. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for any file, photos, movies, music, etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need camera information on each entry. you can see the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single entry or the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information are available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. this information is the same as at the metadata side bar in the main window of & digiver; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then choose the selection from all. this invites all the pictures from their camera to a single album in & digiver. when downloading, pictures are not deleted, before you delete pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; if you have chosen the photos, please use the button to download and then select the chosen button. the button has chosen as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, a new option is available. these pictures have not yet been selected by & digiver. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons all download or chosen ones, a dialog will appear in which you can select the target album. the list of existing albums will be shown in section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & digiver; invites the pictures from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">As soon as you have downloaded the required photos, you can erase them from the camera. you can delete all on once, then you need to delete the button, then you need to select it first and delete the delete chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore the photos taken from the camera. you should fully verify that the photos were successfully extinguished in one & digiver. if you want to delete them completely in a & digiver. if you want to delete it from camera, you should make it more about the camera stream because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras do not use a filename for the photos frequently. the filenames will normally be recycled after the photos taken from the camera. therefore it can be useful when you need photos of various advancements in the same album. therefore it can be useful, the date and the time that the picture was made to incorporate the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the picture and for data-based subwoofers. if you use this latter option, automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options on the transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the pictures are stored on the plate. if you choose this, the corresponding entries are copied to the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the standard format format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M +%. turn the option date & time add. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the option to modify the file names in small letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filame name, den & digiver; for a photo using it will display the camera in the preview window. your settings are stored and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiver; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to do so. not all cameras put this information ready. in the section sidebar you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, the picture in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic rotation, use the button and choose the automatic turning in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been downloaded from the date at which the picture has been made available, you can use it. all the pictures are loaded in the same album. not all cameras set this information available. in section Meta data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off and in this case you save & digiver. if you want to change this option, you'll need to switch this option on and choose the option date based on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their computer to your camera is the button download. then choose the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiver; you, where the pictures are to be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera is out. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. it is a position that can be shown in longitude and latitude. the determination of the data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to combine an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane in order to cartographically an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten us where the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiver. users wish to document the site of the photos, or simply select this aspect, it is good to enrich the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exotic 2 many GPS data fields are available? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geo assignment (manual) and lastly on the manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">You can download the GPS data from one device with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to store these data in the GPX format since this is the only format which is supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from pictures and from the GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the express tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the prefix coordinates to be created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street cards. here are some European sites, at least in french, german and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiver; trying to give you much control of his work processes as possible. there are many settings that enter the behavior of & digiver. to set up on these settings, you must select between these settings. you can change between these settings, by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">You can select the embedded preview or image processing can be started on the embedded preview. set the default behavior of & digiver when you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard diculacy and urberation data. these data will be automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option has been selected when downloading from the camera interface. this data is also written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autoortresults is a synonym for the author of Disassertion: this field should contain the professional drawing of photographers. this can be drawings such as employed photographer, freelance photographer, or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author box, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to indicate the photo. this must not be the author, then these organizations should be registered here since this picture is a storage picture, then the group or Agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions run the data into the corresponding IPTC field. thereby, the metadata is permanently included in the picture, and not only in the database of & digiver;. these metadata have also available other programs and can be imported and can be imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you can add to your photos, which can also be read from other illustrated pictures. attention: in images that are already pre-contained, they will be overwritten by those of & digigiants.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that rests on the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is indicated or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiver; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digiver came; you may want to add the file extensions to this list; Albummy Folders, which has no such extensions, are ignored by & digiver.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can re-press the default settings, press the button on your right from any category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminosity of & digiver; if you can open the light table, these settings can be switched on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode then you should only use different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can get better performance results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can select it here. you can use the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over and overexposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or light colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this view mode can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the images will be coded in a higher resolution of luminance as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, because PNG requires more time to trigger and unpack. if you have a fast computer, you can bet this value to a high compression, meaning 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files, you can switch the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality as the deflate algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment free JPEG-2000 files you can choose fun freely. even if you wrote the loss of loss of quality, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not yet supported, the metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiver, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it's very fast to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, eliminated but the 2x2 lattice pattern with VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white is equal to the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic ink balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not placed. default, it is a fixed color balance which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras, with the effect of the second sensors, the effect of the second sensors has the effect to get more detail in four steps more detail in the top speed. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your camera can begin to consider as transparent white in the settings. at least, use the attitudes within several roubes. at last, you can try some parts of missing information from the top speed.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because the blue pixels generally does not satisfy so fast as green and red. and doping are therefore trying to construct the missing green and red proportions of the still not saturated blue pixel. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, select the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually to each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you will probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of & digiver. to keep the time for the demo version, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the subtraverse image sensor which have many cameras and which provide a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiver came; and Dcraw will provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests it looks so as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm of the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a colour conversion, as you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions such as these are to be given. there are also LCMS and & digiver. information like the color information from a colour space to survive in the other means that colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">If a picture in image processing is opened / color scheme module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sconnect to the folder, such as / usr / share / color / color / color / user / .color / ICC in which you save all your profiles. & digiver. then these folders are examined during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility to deposit & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything can change later when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The photographs of the color view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images and are not the full screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you do not fit. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain dmapping or gammacorrect correction. currently, the crawmapping is not corrected for conversions at 16 bits depth. this means that you have to carry out the color-mapping himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can be given by a device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this could be manually corrected, rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is quite evident for most cameras it is quite evident which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, there is not a table of cameras and profiles together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile expansion can be seen the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the Standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing methods; many modules support, which have been written to work with each program which supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed KIPI modules installed, you can see a list of available modules. if you want to use it, and these will then be loaded by & digigif. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond. see also in the context menu of the lecture menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short-commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get through the KIPI project on http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org, or in the manual books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image crossings, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other turnout fields switch to the metadata or that ends at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left. on the right side, a button Automatically detect a camera which is tried to identify the camera correctly. if you are using this, make sure that the camera is properly connected to the computer screen. currently, serial port, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the end you can use the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have an USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / or so, when you hang up your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">In order to use your digital camera with & digiver, you need to connect the camera with your computer, set it in the display mode and switch on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digiver comes; the camera automatically recognises the camera. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will appear in the menu's cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">Using the option dialog for shifting of &gt; images in the trashcan, you can adjust the talk of & digiver; when deletion of a photos in an album. in the sections of a photos and deletion of an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be used tacit by & digiver; if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar without any feedback. otherwise, you need to apply changes to the modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also read the display of the welcome screen of & digigion; starting with startup. this accelerates from & digiver under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting should look for new photos when searching for new photos taken to look after new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the starting time of & digiver. if something from the base folder was deleted, you ask & digiver if it is supposed to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digiver; used to select the main window to your taste. these settings can choose from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiver, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiver; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and to the correction and improving. image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of a picture or by the menu item menu / Edit menu / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The photo editing includes a series of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiver. so you are under certain circumstances. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of photo editing are changing your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo, before you use the store, save the button from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo, as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you can change it. you can store it with Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the picture, you can restore the original picture to restore deleted from the File menu. you lose any change in the toolbar you will lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last promotion can be reversed by clicking on the reverse and to restore deleted from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are often using this, you should make the shortcut short, Ctrl; -z to reverse and make Ctrl; -UmschAlt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can press a context menu in the toolbar at a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions are also made, or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between pictures in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the toolbar, image high, image low or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will ask if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. they come to the normal view, where you do not want to use the Esc key. if you do not want to change this in the creation dialog of & digigiver. you can call it out of the & digiver; to view this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print it in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire sentences. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer. if you follow the assistants you need to make your choice only.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiver; main window has a side bar at the right edge, the important information and actions available for the selected images. the same page bar is available without navigation use, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders are attached:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider's sidebar will appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can insert a label with unlimited size or insert it. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTCs fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and are converted to special characters. if you want to use the IPTC-label in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comment on, you can either use the button or switch to the next picture, the labelling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user knob there is a button. with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setup, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows a assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Suchen and sorrows. it can always be applied to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for the words of keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digiver; session-made keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The Keyword tree is adapted to the entered search word. you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering in a photo series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords of one image will be stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the higher image and not to the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, keywords and suchants. if additionally one or more keyword filter from the right side will be used, only the cut quantity of these two are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull keywords and cover them. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put them on the selection. as a result, you will ask if you want to make the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example above, the main window shows the pictures at one calendar day. the keyword filter is based on a calendar day. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right voice tree was drawn up and put there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. you can also be switched on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created a rule and notice that it should be one or his, you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is looking for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can select a Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group. see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly changed & digiver; s more concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-administered workflow, you can reach a predictable deviation from the different camera or scanner. with a color-administered workflow you can reach that colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that represent the colors you publish or in the web with them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is coming on color, then everyone wants to express what buttons it must express for the results that he would like to ask for the results of image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information and make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you must not care for colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other topics are per e-mail or web, where sRGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy why you should then use another colour space and make sure that thoughts do not have to do more about colour.</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can see below will be presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hub-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, then visit Bruce Lindsey this page and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB color space or not, you must work your monitor kallion, because sRGB is based on the monitor. if you work as in colour space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve an image in most cases. use it before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, final, automatic and contrast from the menu of Corrigate automatic correction, try automatically to make the best of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see what acts at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the method: this method scaled the whole image, so that the dark point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity of the image is achieved. sometimes, the same very good results achieved by improving the contrasts of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automated: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright marginal shades and adjust the red, green and blue channels onto the complete histo range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of RGB values of a picture by the move of the lowest and highest values on the highest possible range and a new jireation of all values. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiver comes; is a semi-automated tool to perform white and white.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited since a colour space is working with 8-bit per color. in case you can perform the white inside of the original mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your options will be better for correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a Weißer equivalent of Pawel T. Jochym protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it via the menu entry colors white and equal to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the toolbar. if you want to see the original whiteness, then click the picture window to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right is shown a histogram, once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that most pixels are very small Luminanzees. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and Gamma. the shade adjust the shadow details of your photos or even down down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Controlling Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then directly on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white comparison. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white image with the preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed dictator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel overexposed. you will display the combined result in white. this is displayed as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of the white image you can set you to store a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default button presets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white image. note that there will also be neutral settings like your original. if you store it, your original picture is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coefficients of coefficients per color channel of the processed images. 8-bit code is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images. however, this coding requires more record field, data time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. colour tonmapping can be carried out through the subwindow for the helmets range. detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be deducted from the chapter on color.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors pitch. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust the same bug and allows you to adjust these for multiple photos. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner will always need the same error and you will always require the same correction. in the handbook on the pitch file, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct problems is the tool to Gradation, that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiver has four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar energy, even Sabatier was called, a effect of the image provided by a partially developed pressure. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colours were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar radiation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what it is possible. another increase is generated by a negative image that is not on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect to the colours brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it is embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reconstructed color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and this is a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly offers saturated colours, but also some of them photographers, especially those which are barely terraced landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The NeonFilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter levels controls the brightness of the results and the slider to the strength of the neonlight. at large pictures, the filter can take the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your Justices can be viewed in the preview menu. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the converted problem. even in this case, the tool is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leukstärke / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the use of use only the area of slider. specifically the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a gradient of intensity levels, a histogram, the active canals or the selected range. under the Graph, three sliders can be clicked onto the image, the left side represents the dark ones and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and changes it on how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the picture can be viewed on the right hand side. the preview is dynamically updated, on the basis of the picture, on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Angeling: using this selection box you can set whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant color, the linear history is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the uppermost layer for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lower sounds, commonly called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three paint tweezers can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two types that can be used to change the output values like in the input. the compression of the output values can be used for example, for example, to create a light image as background while something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image data will be automatically set depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store and load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color keys, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun. if you want to use and click the preview of the original image for red, green, blue, blue and Luminanzees.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed dictator controls all colour channels to view over overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, the half of the original and the target picture will be displayed, depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this select box allows to address the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are changing between a linear and logarithmic view. most of the linear mode of the sensory colour is produced. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move a short-valve part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that this bright tone can correspond with darker manifolds and that can be darker by the corresponding pixel pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each curve which you can have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three color keys automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun. select the paint pipette which you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzcurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">This option is controlled by overexposed pixels, to view over overexposed pixels. if in more than a channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. here you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in Luminanzas. Schatten- and Sundays was placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the original (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiver; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color creations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of pictures. you can edit it from the menu colors channel-mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you an initial hint like you can correct the relative distribution and impact. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed as a comparison of the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you can position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you are also able to enable Luminrom, as the channel blender is able to reduce this channel mixer for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes a visible noise that comes from the colour space which does not occur at the same place in the color channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion rapidly in which you reduce the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer settings can store it for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed dictator controls all colour channels to view over overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original picture is under (1) and the finished picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your absurdity. with the development of digital photography it is black / white, as colour images simply can be converted to the computer. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to Portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange: simulates a black / white movie exposure with a orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotate Filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with a red lens filter. this created dramatic celain-effects and can simulate mooneness to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the natural shade correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces hot bright and medium tones as a bit cold in the casings. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and recovery in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Decorate with the & digiver, texture texture, you can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture with image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and threescent of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture is applied on the picture below. the original picture is (1) and the change was changed under (2) and the original relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">To add & digiver the tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task. to keep his attention, it is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired type of frame for your image. the image is covered with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), wikanted it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button and decorative stone frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have to cut the tool according to aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any point. this is also possible at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use text orientation, orientation, color, colour space and character set. the bigger the picture, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame about the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting which you have chosen for your text may be changed until you click "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">You can apply a template on a template with the & digiver. template templates can be put on a template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no limitations on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should then send a template on the template's size. if you want your template of & digiate, simply send an email to the & digiver; mailinglist digiver-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder for the templates was set out a building view, which reflects the folder structure of the template. the selection of a folder update automatically the templates of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the darnel picture. it is centered for the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this knob resists in the underlying picture. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you'll need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this knob to postpone the image below the template. take the image and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use the template on your image. the image is then adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digifted; sets three different tools for hooting. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced particularly in dark areas, grains images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shark. actually it can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three, since he really improves the sharpness. it's a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution must be put together to a common color. this is, however, the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has been applied to internal pain. images in the raw material must always be scrutinated during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a scrapping filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this deactivate, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by using a photo with the sharpening markea suit. you can call by the menu entry by the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should point out carefully, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. generally, you will find it about the menu entry Corrigate refocus. under refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it. use the tool to softer with the menu entry basket and experiment something with Settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the picture. the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two key parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase of the radius or amount amplify the effect. if you make the unsharpness mask to make the effect, noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpened images at its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the swisely image that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a breakout of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. you can therefore define a minimal difference between the sounds of sharpened and therefore beauties faults, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unblurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the working picture (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiver; tool refocus is focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the urge-protected maltation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocus on. this is better approach than just to try the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener filtration. refocus is usually better results than unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by refocus on colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fle works much better than the Gauge's Fountain, which is a very long tail, which is far away from the source cover, which is far from the original quicker pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse is influenced by the distant pixels, which causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Fed. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can make a higher value if your image is very insharp, but then on Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the defending effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Volume filters: an increase in the catchfilter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 but rarely helpful. if the sound filter is very poor. however, 0 is the image quality very poor. a high value is 0,03. a high value will not even soiling the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. this is most often used by one before insharpness filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / oderden cracks.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matter size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, if you choose large values for circular sharpness or the Gauge's edge. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range from 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus will be set for you so that it is stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections to the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible, but they left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module on the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp masks produces better result than sharpening. this could be caused by this, unsharp mascot uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never indicate the effect of visual filters. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters can always be at least as good as the impregnation mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original bright color image has to be corrected. this image has been done with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods to be used in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob increases the impregnation of the area being darkened to create a natural more natural pair.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colorfully enables the adjusted color for pupils. if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented levels.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labors in Caen / France and is part of CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as strong points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab displays and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even higher values, mainly homogeneous region smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should get more details so that no weakens need to be subsequently established. please note that the details of the detail pane should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD smoke, a high value of wave-like patterns will produce. JPEG artefacts are being eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum gain factor above all. p defines the relative gain. set this value therefore matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter represents bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is estimated if it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoist effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: is how often the algorithm is gone through. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step 1 [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen, should be also small. please ensure that small angles do not generate a long runtime. so you should choose the value for so size and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixels. you should place the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels Glue and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality which you will receive by selecting this option is only low. but it doubles the term. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. any setting of image errors may be stored in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors are made with small artefacts. the module will be applied on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with a film camera. as you see, there are a unique black film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and the original picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiver came; roughness is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging noise. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available for selected image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust and hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion shows; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor slides of digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial first.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene developed with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the subwindow details and the sub-screen settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is required for the filter. large values increase the time specified by the filter per pixel and allows the image to be moved on the picture and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller error occurred.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the threshold level. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front. if it is increased, smoothed filter must be reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture data can no longer receive and crab or dirt occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can be removed or smoothtips. use it at a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminants of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the details shown by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ones, which typically increases stronger. it also polishes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjittering absorption. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it's too high, smoothness can occur at the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction that you set, can be stored into the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change noise reduction in your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the original correction was applied with (2) and the volume reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture to draw for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen, use the menu entry with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of the operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiver came; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools for photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filters for restorations gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts, film grains, scratches, compressors and local faults that occurs in digital, original or retrospectively digitised images, which makes the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textures. the text is done with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm to restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labors in Caen / Frannd. and is part of CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression compression, he generates some compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards are described in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. any setting of photo restration can now be saved in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restorations is comparatively very fast at work. but it can take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with equal noise. the module will be applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (TM) 700Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grading on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the original picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restorations. this time Textures were able to see an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that have been viewed by scannerlighting and photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiver Boxes. the hotsize is allowed by using a CCD camera with a CCD camera. it is used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels represent a problem, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression technology for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to select & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button dark. the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the proper dark image to correct image. please note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can be corrected to you within the image. the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted in all of view areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of the neighbouring pixel size. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels of the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpolate the pixels of the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less then moved to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, used. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiver; Vignetting correct correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, you can't even reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telephoto lenses show also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filters, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use the center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, as otherwise unsharpen effects are created through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and film-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter and it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter. this tool is used by a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three rules, you can control the Vignetting correct correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which means an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting, reducing it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstärke, contrast and Gamma-Settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetting correct adjustment decreases the luminosity of pixels. you need to re-adjust the accuracy of the target using these options. the knob will provide you only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle re-adjustment of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiver menu. image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correct correction of a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct image in the corners and (2) corrected the correct image. a leukins and contradiction was also performed at the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digival is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses to photos. it uses an copyright protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is treated with general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or conwitch form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar coneffect, but flatter on the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth gradient is corrected the removed corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of the distortion second Grades. with negative values, metric values can be corrected in batches and positive values in vertical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">A corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of Grades. this value acts stronger than the edges in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter specifies the sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thereby introduces the correction of the first gradient. enlarge the negative values while reducing the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated by the dialog with a preview the distortion correct. the values you are using for your image are stored and used as the default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The metric tons and pressure-shaped correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes. best result in this correction as all the first. if you are able to cut a picture and then carry a metric tons of correction would be the effect of the counteract.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you make the best correction to show you this tool in view of the dotted lines. move it into an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site. in connection, you can correct the metric tons / kisular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kisite distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can cut them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the number of tons is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs like pictures from the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the metric tons of correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the Gvaccguru.org webpage. filter reproduces the well known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film subgrains and film sensitivity. the ISO knob increases the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter is used to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply to black / white photos, as the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-infra-red film photo from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the revised picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the advanced.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiver. filter filmmaker is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film graven images such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. this is known from classic high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturers large silver grains of the photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you like this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grading picture specifically in your monochromen photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity. the default value is even though higher values need to be set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film production efficiency on a black / W picture. the original picture is the (1) and the model worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiver came; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a chartered-protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiver, filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to affect the effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited to large images. smooth or, from the other side are considered, the artificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the reference is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Govte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiver, filter charcoal drawing is used for colour and intensity gradients. the images whose gradient are slowly changing, are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you could imagine what scene you could have chosen to outline. that would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original picture (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; filter engraver has shaped your image in 3-D when it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiver. filter engraver is a fast tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing in the content. filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondarling landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering process. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the working picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork by distortion effects. it is used by copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells, and makes it look like whether it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">Using this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork with visual effects. it is also used by copyright algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom insharpness: wiping the image along with globular lines. this simulates a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unschsharpness: swisely the image by rotating the pixels by a focal point. this simulates the impregnation of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: swisely the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera stinese. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: swisely the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the impregnation of a linear moving, z: B: by a car or train photographer, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly visual acuity: swisely the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtiled light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütz insharpness: swisely the image due to accidental displacement of pixels and simulates the impregnation of a arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unvising: find the paddling pool in the image and swisely them to change these without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore end this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropops are a nice little tool to make a drop-drop down to your image. therefore it gives natural your images a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allowed it to change the size of the image. since the drip size is not automatic with the size of the image, it often does not need to reduce the size and density of the drops. fish change changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can do with the & digiver; image processing a range free of regression. use the range of tools to select the area, e.g. a face which will remain free. if you start the filter drop-drop, the area will remain free of regression.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of a drop-drop filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture (2) indicates a sunset by a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformation and transformations mirror.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">An image to be smaller is simple. the great question is how you can find a picture of sound and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information here or errates? the CImg algorithm is used here, makes a good job. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scaled it to the size size with the tool size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to sound.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation of a picture. & digiver. uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo shooting was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labors in Caen / France and is part of CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are mentioned below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio will retain the aspect ratio of the original aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter represents bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is estimated if it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoist effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and shop will be used exactly. any setting for photo enlarge it can be saved as text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very fast in what it makes, but it can take very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below a sample for photo shooting as a small colour picture was increased to the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of the linear default magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not just a normal operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo, you just need to cut the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse and move the rectangle below. you will see this rectangle below while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. this way you will get a good overview like your photo after cutting. you can drag the size of the rectangle to cut off at the corners of the rectangle. you can easily create a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting edge button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to save or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool according to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeter or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons on the selection automatically horizontally or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the maximum ratio button to cut the area to the size possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool follows according to aspect ratios (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the tool bar, these settings are stored as standard values in dependence on the orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data is reflected in the cut-up image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of collation aid permit help enable Help to put together your images better. these Help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles with the diagonal to divide the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Mid: the golden middle is a division which shows on various natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus musel or the blender leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we can feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the old Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times if you merge your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from Fibonacci succession 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 13, 13, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34 & etc. if each number is equal to 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid supply lines if you are using a picture. these Help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring your goal good results for your photos. compared to third party, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric view on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called Golden spiral-corner. this rectangles is used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line of his or different objects. this somewhat can be simply because of the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also derive from the top parts of the golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal to equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame, you create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and the vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are rotated by an angle. you can repair it with the & digiver; image processing and the tool-free rotation. select transforming free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are shown in degrees. with the button preferences, you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help the module allows a horizontal and vertical line to positioning the two lines. after you have moved it with a pressure on the left mouse button you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is the function transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic and cut the function automatic. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">An option of anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after turning. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectively transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angles left: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle Right: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angles left: shows the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right below: shows the current angle in degrees to the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture will be a little contaminated. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have changed the perspective, you have unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. the possibility to bersome is the picture with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to postpone part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shave your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press preferences, the angle will be shown to zero. a preview of the Effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">At your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse at an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the stress, the picture will be a bit confused. for a single shooter, this effect is usually negligible, but two labings are produced twice as much, and therefore you should avoid that.</seg>
<seg id="682">After placing the image, the image has intriangular holes in the corners. a possibility to remove them is the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiver came; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write it from your system and, in some cases, from the type such as these libraries compilated. in most distributions you become a large number of image formats with & digiver.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to the dependency of other libraries it is impossible to present a list of all file formats in this place. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiver. however, only files in formats are known. this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can modify this list of file extensions. you can find more information in section configuration.</seg>

<seg id="852">The printer driver allows to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Photoysizes. the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is sensible for you to improve or print the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can easily import videos to one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command scenes tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original version of Him is: expect from dcraw, not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First choose the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image converters window appears in mode for a single picture. you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white. the essential parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG use a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are going to edit your pictures more frequently or you will not be able to use the JPEG format, since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are going to select JPEG as memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG image file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting your conversion. if you want to cancel this process, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at a time. if you are sure to check out, e.g. through testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to version for individual images. however, here, however, the option has been automatically written to overwrite. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available as far the conversion advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all photos of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it is used to reduce the image program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image size or enlarge four types of image changes:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be automatically chosen, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: provides the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo-apixel. the target pattern, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the list images before. further images can go to the list of images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After being launched the module, the images will be displayed by you pre-selected images. you can add another images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview can be displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be added.</seg>
<seg id="875">The pictures will be removed from the list of the selected images from the list of the selected images.</seg>

<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not change the photo quality. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures file format and select the original files in the JPEG format, then the original externals will be added to the moving pictures.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images. one is integrated into & photo album; integrated and the other as module available (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & photo album; integrated version that you can create via the File menu HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before html pages, you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout, and destination. in the following, each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the review and a description, which should contain the HTML-file later. on a photoalbum; HTML-example pages please see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you can choose whether a & photo album will be created; the export file is to be viewed on the viewing page. more information about Export files will be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information will be shown on the HTML page. so you can avoid that information displayed by a party. for example, all pictures are exported from a party. please note that this setting is therefore not used to hide certain images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how to look like the HTML page. most of the settings are clear, why it will not be received in this area.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures. as a result, those have to view your web page and have a monitor, which have the maximum resolution 800x600, no more download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer faces your site can change the resolution at any time you can change. it can thus change your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, browse. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this mode area, place the different folders and URL that your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and select a new folder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be stored and automatically add to the next time. you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check that these really are all for viewing a URL. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you should specify here. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files created in the final target folder you will have to manually copy them manually. this is the import function you need to specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described adjustment possibilities have all three on the base folder or URLs. in these, a sub-folder will be created, whose name you define in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are located on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you can, of course, you would like to add images on the pictures, Recording place, etc. then you'll have to make a photo album; this work does not have to do with this work.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .kim file. you can import others to your database with exact and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the images itself can be saved in the file or whether in the file you can save all the images into the file, and this file can be saved so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML-pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two times. first, it's all the pictures that you can find in the folder of .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following window, the dialog will be described for export images, which you can export about the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act around internal or external .kim files. there are also the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you manually insert the .kin file, you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of .kim file, copy and photo album automatically; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most pictures have been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it's normally not want to compress files. if you want to compress these files, simply select the Export file to compress the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you want to send your friends images, as the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size limit, by example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using Entries .kim from the web browser or choose from the File menu, select & photo album; the exported database as described in described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to impotate consists of four steps. first you have to select what pictures you want to import, then in which folder will have to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you can personalize the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box which are to be imported into the third dialog for which the categories are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. one example will see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It simply must be simple to search and look at: if you see pictures, you often want to watch pictures from different pictures groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday, you might want to see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) to find the information about your images, via (2) the search and respect, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoste was started as a program to manage your photos. but it was expanded and today also takes your videos. at many places in this manual it is said about pictures, but often does this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; saves all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or rerevisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; notice the folder where your images are stored and uses this at future Starts automatically. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start & photo album; With the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / Company / Gx.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu entry settings on photoalbum; set up to a window that allows you to change the settings of & photo album; you will be able to edit the various setup options in the following section of the user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call on the options of the preview and options for viewing the viewer. for every setting, you can get a detailed help to the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can set various features for each image, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On see the dialog box, which is used to edit existing groups already. for every group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete assembly groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediate as explained in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup options which you are available to set up the member groups. with the above mentioned selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window half there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; divides his modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. for information you can find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photo album; however, most of the modules have a help page that you can call on the memory modules.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used in several applications together, it can be that the modules are tested with the demo database, before you can call them on your own images. please do not hesitate to call them on your own images. do not say that I don't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules above KIPI have very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & photo album; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all the images that show you the picture show currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, a photo album has to be handed over; the modules also has a list of albums. here is a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & photo album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each record of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. if you are using the category people, you will have a photo album; so if you have selected people to view and to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">As some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the range modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example for a starting screen once you start & photo album; start your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, see the top of a menu and a tool bar. currently, there are not very many information, since you don't find any information on your images. in the section we will show this window, but now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the possibility to see each image with comments on the picture, where the image has been taken on the picture, so you can put every picture either individually or for a larger number of images specific remarks simultaneously. if for example on all images Jesper is depicted and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for the search and browses as you can check in the section. if you want to see this comment if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by selecting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you will always be able to use it when you enter information on your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the images within the list: if you have a family party and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can make that the names used up above are moved to people quicker and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an illiterate list, click the icon for Sort on the list below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen any comments on each image, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. Click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then you can select it more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California, are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as an overgroup. in order to show you that it is a special symbol, a special symbol will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the note programme, you can also add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. in addition, you can also pull an entry simply on a category and put it on this entry to a subcategory. attention, this assumes that you're straight to sort out your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the note dialog by clicking the top edge of the frame, click and move the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and look the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also complete a box completely. if you would like to display this window later, use the button options... and then click the window onto a / out window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected images, or all the images you don't have a filter here. you can see the size of the pictures, configure by simply downwards of the mouse with the middle of the mouse, configure. try it simple times.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is shown on the picture. if you don't have a window open with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can delete pictures in the image preview picture. just select the corresponding pictures you want to erase and choose either the removing button or choose either the Edit menu or select the window you can see in the picture you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use your photo album. of course you have to store the images anywhere, so & photo album; you can see the image of & photo album; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for example, the pictures are available in pictures 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9 there are the preview pictures available, so that the preview of these pictures can view. you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to extract files from folders and copy it again. if you don't want to avoid the problem of the relevant CD. if you want to avoid annoying as the dips of your pictures, please purchase a bigger hard drive to save all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, filtering the images that you would like to unaccessible for other unaccessible menu. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures that your little sister may see, control and select the menu entry everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set out what pictures are to be hidden in the case of all your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, allowing all the images you want to have blocked off. if you want to display the pictures again, click the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password to set up the images to unlock the images. to set up this password, select your password in the menu for privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this photo protection is not very secure. for one of the images on the hard drive and on the other one can remove the password as unturnkey text or delete it. this type of password protection is only available to those who are talking with & photo album; not very familiar to the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your images with & photo album; manage and hours over hours to describe them, of course you want to consider them sometime. from this reason, you can watch them out. for this reason, you can preview it out of the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows the picture, but additional all information which you have on the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see it, you can also configure them with the mouse and if you can view it. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the text menu click below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see, matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser gives you all the pictures of Anne Helene. if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you uploaded multiple images in the viewer, you can change between them and return by using the buttons on high and image. you can get the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as Diashau. you will then load a new image after a few seconds. how often a new picture can be inspected by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus, and stopped through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & photo album; is it to change in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer used the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can easily pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can use a rectangle with the minus button. showing how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the outcome of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Using the point key you can reset your zoom, that the image does not have been zoomed by pressing the zooms, so that each pixel is equal to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos will work in and zooming that are positive with the PlusEnergy and Minus.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the images on paper. to see what pictures you want, you can start the viewer with pictures and mark them as good or bad, while using one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch images with features, while you watch them. characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can put a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. you can see all the pictures you can edit, print or whatever you have chosen, so simply add one module to copy the selected images to CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially characteristics can be shown in preview view. if you can view categories in Dre preview view, then you can press features for the feature, after the picture has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>

<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on the painted picture. in order to switch the painting of & kphotoalbum; turn on the image from the context menu. to end the painting you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpoving; you need to have the application of the program & Povray; do not have to dominate but the documentation about & Povray; should you have to be read and understood.</seg>

<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window mounting as default. the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window structure or if you need another arrangement, you can adjust it arbitrarily you can also store several windows orders and move between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To create a window above or below a view, drag the passer to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views over each other, drag the starter into the middle of a different view. you can then change between the views by clicking on the map sheet above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible shutter order are floating Views, which are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the starter onto the desktop or click the arrow pointing to the top left in the Anfassert.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfasserline. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert extra views in the main window. in the menu View, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are woven, you can get it at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can store you with view window attachment... save. it will display a dialog where you can save the window regulations under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpoving; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click the rendering of renders in the toolbar or choose the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality stages, you can add any number of extra modes, from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or choose the menu View... select, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is useful to detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the picture's picture. if you only want to render a small area of the picture, select the check box and give the image cut into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just a beam of pixels, there can be different errors. these images often have a moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this bug. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technology is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is adaptive, non-cursive method; adaptive because each pixel is adaptive again and adaptive because each pixel is increasingly subdivided and adaptive because the record depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, followed in POV-Ray a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color indicate the specified threshold is processed. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grating of 4x4 will be charged at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) extra beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values is exceeded, then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel that can be controlled individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option is reduced to aliasing effect, which is the generation of noise for a beam process called Jittering. if you switch to jittering, change & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflectance is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">In this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; -Consolenoutput. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">In order to import an & Povray; select the menu entry, select the file entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently it supports & kpovmodeler; still not the complete command of & Povray;. when importing error messages or alarms, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpoving; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor in order to import the source text for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object into the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text editor and drag it into the lens.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and insertion in & kpoving; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also included in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, when & kpoving; a scene renders. it usually is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the own screen view, opens & povpoving; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example alfelddles) in the paths to & Povray; libraries. if you enter files not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different patches of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set up the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in the lighter wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like e.g. the sphere, you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the high quality for extended projections, all wire model views are used, if the camera uses a expanded projection. the feature is a better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall will be rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess pattern sample from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor under the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess pattern sample from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross canoe trips, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. for more detailed information about parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing windows orders or create new windows orders. in the section window regulations it will explain how you can create window orders and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Standard-window classification: all existing window regulations. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window connection at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of activated window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected shutters. new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with unts you get the window under the existing window, with the previous view and woven, the view does not include the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and & kpoving; installed and now you want to start without exact knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should also create the ultimate but simple scene with very popular: a ball on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully read the following warnings before you are aware that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should notice these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add no light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark, and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window regulations are:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation that you can expect an adequate presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the property. mark the scene and then choose the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-top view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate. in particular note the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The Object tree now includes a new entry with the designation Camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation about & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything about the basic settings of the camera, but it's later to be reserved, but note that the camera can change the camera in view of the camera. Click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button to button or input, change the wire model views and the lens immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the bottom for the scene. for example, if you add a header (insertion body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a viable method for solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler, actually a simpler way to use. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the button to input or input. in the object, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model displays now also shows the level, but also at the moment only as a limited level. when you rendering the scene, the level extends up to horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will notice that you can fold the entry into the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, spin and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizon line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, select the ground to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted. please select the name of the object. if you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with one click on the button. see how the pigment looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only displays a matte black material, because you can always check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. in this way, enter the colors for the pigment. also there are many possibilities now, but do not take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see in the preview no color on Quader and Ball, click on button users and then call the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you rename your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not the color. you are waiting here. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this too much, but the chord color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select an object tree of each object and change the colors in view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step as you should already understand the basic operation of & kpoving; they should be understood as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can change the settings. adjust the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget to press the input or the button to press the bottom. otherwise, the ball would floating above the ground as you moved the ground to downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, there is now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. set a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can point to your material now. as already in the bottom, enter the sphere of pigments as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Error sub-Objects and change the name for example in sphere pigment. Click on sphere of pigments, select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to set some Finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of the brightness and reflection results already in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it which features you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you rap a scene, Renderer shall shoot hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which is reflected in the scene), the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the nebula. thus, the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will be able to view the camera without a camera. without a light source you can also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene you want to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file which you created in advance with & kpoving; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Always when you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you've already saved the model, it will be saved by the same name. if it's a new file, you have to enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you are not stored in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. this menu entry allows you to select only if you are using reversing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window rules and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or specify an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpoving; here you can change the look, the touch of the keyboard and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for the modification of the keyboard abbreviation. you can modify or add new commands to this option for the default shortcut for & kpoving; -orders or add new options.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar. you can add and remove tool with this option tooling for & kpoving; -orders and remove them.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to surface roughness, without changing any diffrale on the surface, without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture-map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, by application of a picture file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuppe show; is a comfortable image viewer and web browser. the application has a file browser, where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kub show is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking on the & LMBO; or the return Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all the pictures will always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command lines options of Qt and & kde;. additionally, Amarok still has some own command scenes options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency if all required modules are present and use dialog for sure that the user does not expire why a script will not run.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with amarok and Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; that should be used every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts themselves allow the result of external programs and commands. to this point the function exec () is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sending alerts to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts to define their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to indicate the setup dialog. in order to store the Save and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of. if a script is started, Amarok requires the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script could now ask & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the product length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume indicates a change in the volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize MenuClicked: the path to select the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry can be identified. in order to add your own entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop amarok script script script you use dcop amarok Script as eCustommenuette (subtle Title).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal must be processed by SIGTERM to the script. for example, this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah script script may also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are also being compressed with bzip2 (.tar), which can also be detected also with bzip2 (.bz2) that the user can recognize the archive as a Amarok script.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Extended Power script. for this reason, you should make your script equal correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD would like that your window manager uses the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, for example, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support amarine K on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these are an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP, -functions that have all & kde; program common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createDataCDProject () DCOPRef. createMovixDVProject () DCOPref createMovixDVProject () DCOPref createMovixDVProject (), copyCd (), copyCd () volved Cdrw (), burncdimage (), burncvd ().</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (K3b --audiocd) and then a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3b K3binterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">. CreateFolder (Qstring name) a createFolder (Qstring parent), Qstring Parent) provided by addresl (Qstring path, Qstring Parent) (Qstring path, Qstring newborns). (Qstring path, Qstring newname) with setlist eID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">It is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / Bash Project = $(dcop K3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $Project createFolder is dcop $Project createFolder / foo dcop $Project CrUrl / home / trufftxt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is a audio CD; it is a audio CD; it can easily be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compress & CD; files in WAV files on the hard disk) and from many cordiers that these WAV files are supported (compelling free compression), and more coding can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and saved in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) will be compressed to MP3s or OGG files or other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudioa; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodiers are already available, it is highly likely not necessary to compile a bit. however, only the coefficients will not be used. if you do not use FLAC, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiers gives a small introduction to Kodiers, audio quality and compressive factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copying protected audio CD; s: like already said, used & killiterator; cdparanoia is not available for any copying protection; it is not possible to remove any protected audio CD; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD; even if not the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid simply the purchase of copying audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While doing only once has to be done (the setup dialog, but can be called as often called up to an appropriate configuration), after everyday use of a & CD; on the hard drive, this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim design of the user interface, which you are often stumbling at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything will be recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the side step by step example, more information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Launch the CDDB request from CD-data according to the tool by request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet can be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the setup page in the setup catalog - coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so that the selection can be read with any other Encoder as the standard. it is to note that the encoder has been configured in the setup dialog for setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing a file to encode and encode them instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as read the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main layout dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various card cards (such as Encoder, for setting the Encoders). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you with the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">When no audio information should be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compresses depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG saved the most often. OGG today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, it is still provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (for high bitrates) but compared to OGG easily deeper quality at a deeper bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tracks are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also part of other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo modes. today - initially 2009 - these devices support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to the audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide for most people and most of music-pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-stereo stereo plants with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo stereo modes with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate of about 5.5. do always need 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo stereo modes with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, a stereo, compression rate of approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of juveniles, portable devices and auto-stereolics. but not good enough for better stereo stereo modes.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be aggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely don't want the absolutely highest quality without any feedback to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which are manually entered or through the program automatically entered from freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can use / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the coefficients and these parameters here. the manual or assistance to the coding do the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s with lame are coded, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator has to be added; the result looks like this: '-tt {...}.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freedb is: a free database, in which information can download / enter, so that all other information can download / enter, so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Appeal of the Uebery): that is the author of the Uebery. however, no one can prevent the artist or CD; any more or less valuable, so either the artist or CD-company can be added. all information can be given thanks to a Bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (Sing an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieve the data from server (but this can only know the programmer that checks the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geo at the next underlying mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the host.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval & CD; information during reading a & CD; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created every month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumoured that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know it, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed at first, if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the advertised WAV files, the codiers and therefore the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening there are predefined entries for you (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossing free compressing for audio data) on the register tab. other coding can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined coefficient of Kodiers. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter of Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodiers, more information can be received via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check the setup of the device designation of & CD; / DVD learner, write and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio coding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could be a hint that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the sheath of the & CD; this will not be able to succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but they understood not always uncertain what is to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD; we're going to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Cdparanoia and lame are already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it cannot be considered as a fully-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd / cd exists and that you have write permission to have (eg; by trying to copy in with the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setting of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what must be repeated for each additional & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression of music (optional) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224-256 kbps), where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program using freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to check out a & CD if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program, so it is able to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to create existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here you can't do much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, select so that you will be informed if information on account of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card box CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; it can be connected to the Internet, so that he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, a & CD; entry was found immediately, when you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or filename is changed with conquorder &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, then disable the box fields and freedb is not used if you want to use the database before. however, these two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for the retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server on the Internet. how knows the system you want to get the CD? read the section on freedb. use everything that is depicted in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we do not have the database available, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to site freed.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. on this path the load is distributed between the host. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both of them work equalled as to the server, since there are many firewall in the protocol 8880, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transfer any & CD to the freedb server. the first deposit box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one using existing drive? paralleles and encode? the author does not know, therefore just trying to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, you cross this to throw the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you cross it, then / must be the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. this field cannot be crossed, if you do not want to use the files in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything you enter as it is on screen photo. the command is slightly long, under certain circumstances, some might need to be seen in order to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is an attitude for very good audio quality, even for very good audio quality stereo facilities. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of the generation of tags at version V1 / V1.11.11.11.1' ID3v2 'tags can be deleted when necessary, in case of a later change of tags.% f and% are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic equipment of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for any excerpt of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisation structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading & CD; we'll be able to create MP3 files. firstly, there will be a connection to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will have to pick up. the process of this section must be repeated for each additional & CD; it has to be repeated for each additional & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we have a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screen photos look at a little differently than for a & CD; so you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of sending them from the Internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this sample you can find. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only when the & CD; identified as audio CD; can be identified and saved by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happens, you will find questions and answers after assistance, or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully from freedb, all titles of the pieces have already been completed and then the name of the artist and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the case that there are more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window embedded, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually select this by selecting the first buttonholes in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'updated title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'updates', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for each piece of iniemas per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to verify the contents of the CD-Editors, so that you do not only start with the artist or album names (eg. if all words with letters begin or not...), but also to verify whether there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this restricts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album, and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentard. this option is set up on the coefficient of Kodiererts; take a look inside the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the files created later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see in the help of codiers to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obviously with the style of the selected CD; this is not important because we do not transfer the & CD; data soiling anyway. for more information go to Web site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or ap to the example are under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing the 'OK', come back to the main window. Click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you can see that the fields are filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. specify the entries for the fields of the current item. specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you have all the title data of & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Please note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. you are already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the product list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece. only the title can be selected so that a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or put the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection process has been started, this window appears to confirm your confirmation. you click on OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders for switching on the order window. it is on the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you are trying to work with a coater, which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp-file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example. have you checked: write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encode in parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that configurable is the number of parallel processes, the result is unclear. the calculator with a AMD64 appears no problem when simultaneously reading and encode (from there two different things).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the queue of the Kodiers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the coefficients of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece play, you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of speed display and then change the playspeed. to get the original pace, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The ledge has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button can break as a pressure on the button or choose the menu of the menu, so the playback will be played while no piece is played, start & kmid; reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two ways in one music piece. some pieces use Texterminers, others use lyrics, and again other types. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better: the event of the event is automatically chosen, so that you don't need to adjust the automatic karaoke text, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up a type of event, select from the menu settings the entries of Texterminisse or song events. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarize. these will be played by the series. in this section stands how to use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">In order to put a collection, open first the collection manager. you can find this in the menu collection under the item Organise.... Click there to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired value in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection of all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">In case of application the application is not saved. write this collection if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, she must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the button. again, the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add is enabled to the collection, a piece of opening (using the file open or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically Adding to the collection, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied for opening a piece of the temporary collection, then the collection will continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">In order to remove a song from a collection, you must select the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the menu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or choose random sequence in the menu, the order will be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">In order to play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "in order to jump another song, select the" "" "button" "" "button, the record" "" "out of the menu or press the arrow on the left." ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">In order to erase a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection may not be deleted. however, this does not matter if it is stored in the leaving & kmid; it is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is definitely necessary for Synthesizers, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type of Change-patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus leaves a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including AWE - and GUS maps, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite seitor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that saves all required settings for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which must appear as often as desired. but the condition is that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that one section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of an section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail, so that I can do in future versions of & kmid; support for devices which are not compatible with General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches will be depicted as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM-patches is in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, but also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all tones of this instrument on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (rifles), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here comes with the concept drum patch of Patch, where each tone is a different tone instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum means (like some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to give as sounds shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are used mainly to form sounds on the capping channel. take a look at the supplied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange for the first and second channel, simply do this in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap must of course be defined in the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored, try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the Perkus's patch to the Perumbnail channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchie ratio has to be multiplied in which relationship with the value of pitch will be converted to the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to make a decimal value in the Map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM assumes that a keyboard, that is to play a pitch of the event with the value 4096, a sound higher should play. unfortunately, some keyboards will be able to play two sounds up to a octave up. to try the right value on your keyboard, you'll need to try a bit by & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI Settings. you can find the MIDI settings in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of pivials (one for each MIDI channel). on these lambons you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you have changed a instrument, the button does not shone more green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to indicate the played sounds. the view can choose the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed to play with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a song. if you find, e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can not adar to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer. if using a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you compiled a binocular (rpm, deb) by & kmid; because it has been compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source code (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't have a desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to & kmid; -Windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic adjustment of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow button on the left of tempo LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; work area a & constrior; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this work area (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, merely go to & konqueror; -Windows, and drag the file into the window by & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without them directly to a collection, turn the automatic adjustment of automatic adding to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.E. Zuknot only want to play the first file. so adjust the automatic adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you want to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I animate this, continue to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maths; Laga. I am in the third year, so I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take me a bit time. as hobbies have I collect programs, music making and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where she can download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want me to make an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a MIDI file, then I'll be able to receive a MIDI file, but you should contact me when I don't have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid. I wrote & kmid. I was written in my free time and not welcome to anyone's money. I would like to emphasize that I get only further programable because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the absence of the error that the pitch at AWE-cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality is dependant on your soundcard. it's not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it runs as if you had a sound card, except you can listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mail lists or send an error correction directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and FFMpeg. the program is used for playing video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD's, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only appear when information is returned to it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections under the bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are used after each other, then you should use the "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "category." ""</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchestufe. if you ancillary one entry, his group will be copied to the current category and play the playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct editing, but also by application itself. by clicking on a name of a category, click on the menu view and as next processing mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing from XML files, you have to choose from the menu with playlist and select either the processing mode or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched to by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and moving can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing from [General Options] No Intro = 0 'option to' 1 '. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / km.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / km.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting does not need to be short, it will automatically end through the opening of a different source. however, this would be annoying with the end-animation, the user can stop the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the advertisements of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / sec; / sec; / sec; / sec; / bodysuits; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MP3s in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data center can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual operation of the file sharing by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' with the module swfdec-Mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted the special field of bed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider can be specified as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog boxes of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; is used in a consoles working and to search for error messages. if no error occur, the backend output is written within & kmplayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a pre-built backend for a certain Mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this should be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon should playback all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play on TV cards, either by MP3s or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the scanner will need to be used manually, or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in kmplayer is the dialog for Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; Xvideo Port. there should be ports detected, from which one is selected. (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably includes a DVB-in.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR function can function only Xvideo (probably this kind of playing video devices could work on Linux). this is also supported on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux is to function for the X server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, dvdnavel, texts, tvscanners, tvc source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any indications like I can play my CDROM, when I play off from it (not by the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is to run root under the integration of the device. this is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why does my CPU needs to be tested on their power each time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhaut kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will test the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries will appear. if & bibtex; the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be found in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ r is used for determining the font size. it is possible to specify the fonts for the main text, the FuÃ ¼ notes etc. there are the following characters available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">In the call of & kile; two selection criteria are available for processing: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determination of the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets on the command\\ documentClass contain the settings for the order. setting [12pt] specifies the font size specified. if the font size is specified, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code is entered, the & latex must be compiled. the simplest way for this is the use of the building construction or the pop-up building.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. store and store up automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document command should be visited in the log after the errors. when using quick-structure & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the log file should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (English.) is a text that will be different from the rest document. for example, a report with the written document shall be created and just a few south exposure. the order\\ Begin {Terms},\\) and\\ by {Terms} in terms of the size of the written form.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The required limitation will only be accepted within the environment (from\\) to\\ by {Terms} up to\\\}. there is no restriction (number) for each other in a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">For example, there are many mutations for the ability of read and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain type of fonts, greener, subcutters, etc. these commands are either using the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the cranial pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a\\ '{amp} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented by\\\' word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ 'quota: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {odds} and ends with\\\' quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text by the & Latex, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile is now followed by a step-by-step guide.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant was entered a bit text, some changes for the better read of the document should be performed. at this point a quote, a few places in the fat and cranial pressure, should come to the application to view the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed by editor-view or CtrE (by the internal viewer), it has to be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file can be converted and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a few-quality file format (narrow. D e V ice I nd.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for example, there are many different types of .dvi -Edition like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document via file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool shows the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file created from the & latex; source code can start converting other formats using the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prewastness search the direct jump from the editor to your added position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Bind files. it only needs to set up Modern under Settings Kile... Continue reading tools construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to search the pre-search-search, the mouse has to be positioned in a line of the source text and close it. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Using this feature in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document and appropriate lines. this must be done as text editor; in & eyepiece; as text editor you have to set up the eyepiece - editor only)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the use of quick assembly of the & DVI; -view doesn't need to be a mistake. if a bug is available, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file indicates the error source in the source text. the log file is always used to view the faulty line. in order to view the faulty line, the log file must be clicked on the error in the log, navigating immediately to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the respective button in the tool bar, a window appears to choose the selection of the displayed template for the document. the preset properties are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting the empty document, a document may either be rewritten or used to create a new document or an assistant to the fast creation of a new document. more information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates are created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / Latex; file extension or a new file must be created. & kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings and set up the settings in general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know what strings can be replaced by the variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering in documentations. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentaries [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and thus verbal objections to the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then the own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet, and should be moved under the described steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for the possibility of reading and approach of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for tools directly from & kile; can be made out of paper tools.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his mosquitoes should be used to experience the manual. users of & kile; are there directly with the reading of the chapter by clicking the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command preference which can be called by the LaTeX reference. it contains an elaborate description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double click with penetrated string key to balance the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking on\\ par\\ certified\\ certified\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text into a text with a left mouse button, the balanced text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a pierced buttons parts of the source text in the Editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source texts to well and to say that. for example, the & latex commands themselves distinguish between the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants are bookable. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. this trampoline is highlighted by the leap for the next or last ski mark. this trampoline is highlighted by the first input of a sign automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main situations at use of a program like & kile; however, important functions for writing the writing of a & latex; detailed functions for the writing of a & latex; special commands for their selection. under work interpreting are the following commands are contained in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Wishing a complete paragraph of lines that contain an empty line (like in other text editor). this extended meaning should be included with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only humorous thing in & kile; is that the abysses are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Keep the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also has a extended star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To be a part of the document, natches can be removed at first of this first. & Kate, with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with your own request for a faster GPU. under processing, the following commands are contained to the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">A complete paragraph can be removed. the definition for a subsection in & kile; is included in the description on working.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments will play a central role in & latex; therefore, it offers & hurry; for further orders under the work environment for a simple work with & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command the cursor is placed at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command the cursor is placed at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is placed before or within the command\\ Begin {vicinity}, the cursor is injected at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many different ambient temperatures, fast the daily amount can be lost quickly. this command is close to the last possible environment, so that the external environmental structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands, which correspond to their work environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command the cursor is placed at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the welded Klammer.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command the cursor is placed at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded Klammer.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded Klammer of a & tex; -group # is, the other end of the group is speckled (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering lots of welded groups clamps, fast the daily amount can be lost quickly. this command will close the last, so that the duck structure of the & tex; groups are not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & Latex; two simple control signs used as a standard for use. for the purpose of this purpose, the sign is used. for this case, the sign is used. & kile; knows this case and for two close connection signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic feeding of the double starter can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX - and follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used as specific settings (e.g. nd. or French) and thus German or frankinetic instructions. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">At the Drums of Shift; Inclusive and kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. breaks, or itemize); not only a line breaks, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a tables setting, t & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an incoming line breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to underpset the preset & latex; - or custom environments. this enables you to configure, setup... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users can arrange the columns in tables environments, and all Et characters (amp;) are related to each other. if this tabulator is not to be able to add-in; according to the nessing table, add & kile; some of them add to the columns position of the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate, already a good source text content, it was installed in & kile; for special commands are installed, three of which are necessary for the automatic processing. all these modes can be set up for different working hours under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">In the beginning a new environment using the command\\ Begin {vicinity} is & kile; automatically added to the command\\ 'environment, after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the start button, the last character of the input will be removed and can be filled with it. on the other hand, the list can also reduce the list by entering a further letters.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from a command. alternatively, ski marks are possible, so that a simply jump to these positions by means of this jumping marks are possible and the desired parameters will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under atting settings; set up, make it possible to make this lists. there are various WÃ ¢teau lists for & tex; - and & latex; orders as well as Written on the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not used for the processing of environments. it is always used to have a few letters with\\\ in and the call for the event will be done. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & kile; a special mode for the processing of environments to be used for processing.</seg>
<seg id="1844">During the call of the full-time periods or the keyboard unit Alt + Shift key, the command will automatically be frozen and it appears\\ Begin {and then the environmental impact can be completed and terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantitative. may have to do with & quantitative. thus, the plug-in system is very powerful. you can't wait until someone can use the desired position in & quantitative. the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be used in a large number of & GUI. more about this can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or part 1, we begin with the menu plugins. this is what the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new elements. we describe each & GUI; item in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, it is quantitative & quantitative. this path to the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relation to one another. & quantitative metus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project like both team leaders as well as Subproject ladder.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is. this is done by pressing the team member of the list and pressing the button as well. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important as news and comments. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team: it may be an event for information to the team manager, if something particular happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed if something special in the project is happening. an example would be the opening of the opening and closing of the project that a file is secured, or the sending of a message if a file is secured, or a script that will be added a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project settings dialog can create events, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the address data selected in the receiver list. the address can be a team or subproject ladder. see in, wei such ladder can be established.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments on documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note comments is simple. it can either choose the Note entry menu from the Editor menu or the @ annotation Key word in a comment area followed by note text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Annotations can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the nickname of the team member states or @ annotation (Role), the role in the project from the following possibilities: team manager of Head of Subproject leaders should be given in the appropriate enrichment or subproject name, such as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantitative lus; regarding to tags, including car completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / small volume of tags: large / small friction of automatically added tags. normal age / small friction means, the tags are inserted as inserted into the day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small detection of attributes: large / small volume of fixed attributes. normal age / small friction means that the attributes are inserted as inserted into the tag.XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if attached, is optional for tags, which is optional for the closing tag, this is immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Starting and closing tag automatically update: if switched on, the corresponding day is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic set of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the respective coefficients during inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: Mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using a button standard, default values can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: coding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files (where the coding of file can be addressed), but this setting is put out of the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is put out of the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative backup; creates a regular backup copy, so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered. this is not the same as saving the file. even for even stored documents, a backup is regularly created, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editoret or its own View (or the documentation in a cartiliter), which makes it possible to view the documentation, the preview and the source text simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the picture of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structural tree, it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural building with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings the visibility of knots on tree can be set automatically and how deep in a change in the structure is set automatically, empty groups are the empty areas of the text, while empty groups that are not found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for determining abbreviations (a type of templates) that are unfolded in groups, each can be divided into groups, each can be divided for several & DTEP; this means it can be a valid group for PHP, which means that the ifone abbreviation is valid as in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed here. plugins are Kpart applications from third side, which can be reused by each Kpart-capable application, at the most famous & conqueror;. when inserting a plugins must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plug-in, if it is not located at a standard location such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be plugin to the plugin when opening, so it can open the current file (the path of the current file) or the Project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plugin is refusing to keep the store. only-reading box is usually refusing to store the shop if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Review the plugin: if this is activated, then tested & quantitative information; if the set information is correct. then select the saving of the order then, if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & Quaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. the support for the DBG Debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debug plugin concept has been implemented, which allows a variety of Implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantitative; inquantitative.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Use the Debugger for a project with the selection of a matching debugger plugins in the project settings. use the options next to the Debugger plugin box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a project is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & Quaplus; User Interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of overturned variables will appear. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions listed are listed. usually appear in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) is shown in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plug-in to listen to Debugantry requirements. this action is activated by default when a project is opened, which must not be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugly Session Starte the session. closes the connection to the debugger or end the leaves to meet the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to the server for a debug requirement. this is equalled by using a browser to view the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points out the debugger, with the execution of the script and to send information about the overheated variables and the current line. if this is happening, the execution is continued during the script, the script will start, starts the script with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points out the debugger, with the execution of the script, without information to overflowing variables and the current line number. if this is done while a script has been given, the execution begins, as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger will perform the next instruction in the script, without going into the functions or include files.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger will perform the next statement in the script, with if possible in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to go to the assignment and to go to the next so, when there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the revised value appears in the variation of the variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & Quaplus; adapted to your needs and help you to be able to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Documentation type Editpakete (DTEP; s) are used in & quantitative languages; they are used to provide support for marking and scripts. your simplicity and flexibility gives you a fast, user friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, the Markup languages and family options. tag folders are composed of two parts, the tag folders and the workpieces. day folder are handmade, symbolified lsten of image crushing (above the editing window), the text and instructions are faster into a document when one user might ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; (see below), downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DTD. see detailed instructions for details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are created, then the descriptionc; and also workpieces. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featured Vendor; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even the tool bar permit a fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a spelling.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are not as folder. you only contain the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the restriction language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and clarifies whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better view and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains no one element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The Type of tags is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; a argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute value and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. this is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Discusses the attribute of a tags. this element can only affect the name and the type of attribute. additionally, there is another tags which describe how this attribute will be displayed & etc. this is a one element element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code for the attributes in the day-Editordialog and attribute on the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative data is used for reaching the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology within & quantitative within & quantitative. is used for the achievement of the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodological name. the arguments that may be handed over to the method can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">One box-tag that sets the elements of a list together. it can only occur only once. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute value of a tags within a dialog box. this tag can only occur once in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog box (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Day). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the given tags. this element is a one element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that would end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files have to begin with a & XML; XML version: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and have to be properly assembled and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; whatsthis &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not work, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To verify the TagXML files, the tools dialog boxes is to start in & quantitative. -Windows to start and check out TagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family of 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; Element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this tXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP directive is described. the file name of these TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "subject" type = "tab" type = "string" status = "option" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as fairly easy and there is a editor for that you can choose a list of selectable & DTEP; for a new list of selected & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionc; should be created with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = Use 1 for & quantitative information; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set actions with settings... created. Click on New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This of this promotion is assigned a button. with clicking the button user, a button can be assigned to a button; with Kone, the current keychain is remote.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest promotions. it can be entered in the detail settings and inserted when action in action, this text is inserted into the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can change external applications (usually scripts but it is not limited) that can change the document or as input (or parts of the document); even the rapid start-dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to find the% scriptptest variable in the command line: global script: $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative process; only one instance will be replaced by the PID number. this is useful when the COP to control the control of & quantitative. this is useful when the remote script is used by the remote script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the enumerated methods, a script from & quantitative from & quantitative. in the select box input can be determined what is to be send in the standard input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected range of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly, the output can also be redirected to the output. there are two ways of issue: normal edition, written on the standard issue, error messages must be indicated by the standard output text by which the value is set to the standard output issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the check-in, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. in the case it is not too many too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool is added, you must add actions and configure actions. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag have attributes and you can plan your use, activate a dialog "Day," when available, allowing a check when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igor! is this a bad icon. who should remember the action in combination with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kicone; select from the & kmenu; select Other Programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kills; used by default 32x32 pixel but we need 22x22 pixels. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as less, starved, further interprets), or should at least, a message to the user is signalized, that clicking this symbol will insert a & lt; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it has to set up with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantitative counter;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box, press a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete this.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantitative functions; these functions are to be divided into several groups, or it should be shared by several separator in several groups. make sure that the tool bar can be selected by setups. make sure that the required material is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to use a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator does not support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; button is the opposite of the Start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by probate all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your workpieces should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your own toolbar (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most desirable expansion of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentary tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & Quaplus; -Repository if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; you need to create the docrc file. in the first part we let you let the second deal here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc thee = Path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # 2.3 = Sec2.1.html Section 2 = Sec2.3.html 2 = Sec2.3.html) 2 = Sec2.3.html, 2 = Top 2.html di1 = tag2.html di3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section of the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation so somewhat:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc thee = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2, = Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Getting Started = Basic Use = Basic Use,... Basic Use = Attach.basic syntax = html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Please note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the boxes (except of the mind) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the directory of the directory is referenced to a file (and it is consistent at the top end of the section & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">There are no spaces, but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the docrc file which serves for the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, if when writing a & PHP; script the documentation here would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connecting lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of cutting separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and easily save $HOME / .kde / share / apps / apps for local and global use. then create a folder (such as do this in your file docrc), in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and well are worth to be shared, send your docrc files containing a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to use the & quantitative Act; -Repository for the use by the & quantitative. you will not be rich, but proud of being in the best web-development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & Quaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an email entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) using Email, toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all other & quantitative information can be reviewed and only available when our team is going to be correct and used to sign up a full post what it is ensured by a GPG / PGP key, making it possible for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can leave one input. in the dialog new resource, you need to continue to fill out the input fields (URL preview can stay blank) and clicking with OK it's upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool-mounted tool bar and will be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>

<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages which currently does not need to be created by using a DTEP package. the creation can be more elaborate, because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag.It gives the easier way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD load and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD-description which should be used, then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target templates: the new set & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / dtep folder with this name.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantitative information; by converting the & descriptionrc; text editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & Quaplus, there are some keyboards. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantitative information; this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2082">This differentiation has been divided into three areas: global, locally, and projects. these differentiation affects a range of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantitative structure; it is all that is saved as a globally active folder structure of & quantitative. this allows the group of administrators in different workpieces, actions and patterns in global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements make a personal collection of web development funds for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The projections are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -samples up to workpieces especially for the files of a particular project. all elements are put into the folder tree of the project, which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & Quaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building prospects, the cartilitres with infos and the toolbar. please beat in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">In order to receive a context menu with the right button of mouse, you can receive a context menu with the current document, such as close to the current, other or all box-reiter, re-load or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or design of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the Editorsection guide to another context menu regarding the processed document, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / input), editing the file under the mouse indicator or open the file if the string can be referred to a file under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorflaw, the toolbar of the editor are currently taking action & htaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative data, the tool bar will be adapted to new features, and thus adapted user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert it in a simple tag, e.g. & lt; if you want to insert the tag, then you can insert the data for this just added day. if you want to insert the data for this just added tag (like anchors), you can fill up different fields in a dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow it to open and pass through the information on & quantitative. it is available for files, project, sample templates, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that shows & quantitative. this view shows all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions such as Hints, remove, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on the & quantitative area. global templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more about templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script. the concept of the integration in Global, Lokal and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. more functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. through the left-click of an element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by the right-click of an element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with it, manoeuvattributes and namespaces can change. this allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks on the contents.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. it can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation of & Quaplus; the quantitative documentation can be created, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be upgraded, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quaplus; two cartons at the bottom of the window, via the useful information can be achieved: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartiliter shows information about each in Quanta in running script. for example, the DTD used the current document and all changes to DTD is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box shows all errors in the process up of the current document. & quantitative scripts that are designed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & Quaplus; tool bar are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define your precepts as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitative information; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & Quaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar-Archive via & Gmail;. if they get a tool bar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantitative files. in order to get a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantitative data, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>

<seg id="2206">The compilation of binary templates is simple: the file will only be used in a template folder. it can be used all the file management functions for it, such as pulling and put or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the right and set up a folder template on a folder to a folder and to secure a name for the template, but of course it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very slow-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and footlines, or dynamically associated with & PHP; arrange files insert or combine with them. in addition, one can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files used in $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps / share / apps / apps / Download / Download files. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set up the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select the menu menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select field with the three previously described types; files, Text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as elternal attributes failed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits for everything except for pedigree in the preliminary settings. if a regular folder would be enabled, unless they would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a pedigree folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed to precede or later text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines and footlines for a specific project and allows you to equip a folder with special headlines / foot lines an entire presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (show the right button of the button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quaplus; offers two modes: VPL; text editor and VPL; & source text editor, which are accessed via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor does not work as follows: it invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and reset the source code editor when the changes made in the VPL; text editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; text editor on a document that contains & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; text editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it's not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; text editor. there are no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the cursor in the source text editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; Editor is already active, this mode is set to the active cursor from a window to the other, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... It is possible to select between synchronization after a click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be adjusted additionally. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for quick calculator and a large span for slow speed.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so is the editing of the visible tags at work with the VPL; Editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; Editor is also being created. this allows you to change this:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information on the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows the change of the inhale, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules using the buttons under the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as the Meta Elements. the work of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS-style template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is as described in a text processing, by reference to the arrows, possible. under rare conditions, the cursor lasts as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by subtype, and be erased by pressing and return.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare the same. why so & diff3; please let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time correcting the back. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were many conflicts over merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the positions where might perhaps only the inclusion of this changes was a small album.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of more useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a fully-advertised file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merger is fully supported. this is useful when two persons can work independently of one piece of code and changes the original file. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result. the screen photo shows three Quell Files primarily associated with:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merging folder. this screen photo shows & diff3; when folders result:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today's specific paint monitors. if you often have to check boxes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tobacco are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, you can see that on a summary of the summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble more if Jeller changes the back.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color shows which the file is different. red colour means that both are differentiated.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make sure that you can complete the file work by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows the manual subtype of filenames using file names, select a selection of the file browser (file...) or select a last opened file from the list box. if you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Above the button folder... you can also choose a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge folders will be introduced. if a file is selected, for B and C, but you use a folder, then use & diff3; filenames using A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If coupling is crossed, the input field is active for the goal and can process it. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file. you can also finish this step later.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The single button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before starting with the initials.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison starts instantly. in the opening dialog, you don't need to select files simply using the shutdown button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and use them: simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind? sometimes one file has several similar functions. if you like to find out what these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you need to add two appropriate files, simply add and compare these functions. now you can easily add the relevant sections, then compare and compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't pull out anything from & diff3; only the closing of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreted the drag and put text into another program as expressions and insertion (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info-line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (please note that windows C is optional). (if the path is too long, let the mouse leave for a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to letters A, B and C. a color is blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see the color that file itself differs. if both files differ, the default color is especially useful when you compare three files. this is very useful when you compare three files. this is clearly visible in the next section (merger).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text there is a summary column. if the differences were found, the color shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + + e.g. white signs only in strings and comments, for the processing unit and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summary column of the text, is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line sequence is activated, the line will be packed with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative windows) also has an Info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [gechanges] if you have processed the result. usually, it does not contain text by automatic assembly, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, the saving is deactivated!!! (use the knobs of next soluble / odd conflict to find even the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative drivers are used, every difference may also be solved by a conflict of the manual.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group will be selected and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this group will be highlighted by the beginning of the group otherwise.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current range and each on the left shows a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it remains of the automatic assembly or by manual Edit no further line left in the group; then it's only a placeholder for the case that you will change your mind and perhaps again a different source. this text is neither written in the final stored file, nor in a marker you might easily copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembly Contractor; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore the options, ignore them or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate to the keyboard, and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys left, page, end, Ctrl at the beginning and Ctrl as you can also be used by other programs. the overloaded column next to the vertical image bar can be used by clicking here.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insertion button, you can change between insertion and overlocking mode. (default is the one-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the panel columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already discussed in the section) and the editable output window was explained.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference (Ctrl bottom / Ctrl above) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl bottom / Ctrl above) or to the next / previous conflict to be considered as conflict. hence, between soluble and unredeemed conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the clippings in the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Strg insertion). if this option is enabled, automatically copied to the clipboard and write the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX variants are using a line-set-in characters\\ and Win32-based systems use car plug-in return\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line-line of the source files, therefore you should use & diff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start. (menu Inscription - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script with a fixed width. (on some systems the scriptures must also be used with variable width to choose, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences will be displayed in cursive script. if the selected scripture doesn't support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be gerated. on these systems, the default preferences will automatically assign an unmatched color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, button 1 will inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or Return, the back of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy is then discharged into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual range on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When the same files tries to find & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files. the second step compares any line. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. however, the white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car crash '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes in the side-on-side comparison, but even though they are different. if this option has been activated, however, this option must be disabled. during the merger, this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored, but they will be treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after even smaller differences. the option is activated in the default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic transmission mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next odd conflict is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by pressing the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) It is useful if the automatic selection can also be saved in numbers or comments if the options suggest or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and run a merging. look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge guidance.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original is attached. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current program. you need to finish and reboot the change. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available, because the language is set there on the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if one activates this option, the option will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for encoding code appears a short notice which is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this is influenced to be treated as special characters and interpreted as the encoding for each file can be selected individually, even files with different coding can be compared and assembled.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what encoding should be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could use 16-bit ASCII, but the pre-processing command can only define with 8-bit ASCII.) Using this option, you can designate the coding of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress any changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or reviews, if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all differences in a color-coded oversiest column are displayed. but sometimes you want to see the differences between two of three files. after a selection of A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -d; C will be displayed next to the normal oversiest column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available seat on the screen for long lines. write the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison windows by side or other. this can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. the current file will then run if you use only two files. if this function is used as default name for output file. (if this function is used to run the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">Reading a file, it is first delivered to this external command. in & diff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessing, which is exactly your requirements. you can use this function e.g to cut interfere parts or to correct use.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Reading a file, it is first delivered to this external command. if also a normal preprocessing command is given (see above), then the issue of the command is used only when line. you can write your own preprocessing, which corresponds to your needs. each input line must have a line line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable more flexibility during programming of the diff results. but this is an external program needed, and most users wish to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line-in order to change the input in major letters: SED's /\\\\ 1 / '\\. *\ 1 /\\\\ 1 /'\\. *\\\\\ 1 / '\\\\\ 1 /'\\\\\ 1 / '\\\\\ 1 /'\\\\\ 1 / '\\\\\ 1 /'\\\\\ 1 / '\ 1 /'.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioncontrol systems use some keywords to automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same sample $keyword\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ Baur\\ _ BauR _\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\ _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with SED, you might want to understand it and perhaps do not like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good as an example of a further preprocessing command for line-off. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character is between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and every displaying is replaced by nothing, so it's deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you want to perform several objectives at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different like e.g. perl -s' s / REGEXP / Enforcement / switches' Allerdings are different in perl several details. where SED\\ (and\\) needs perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data on the normal preprocessing unit will retain for viewing and maintain. other operations can only change the data that can see the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processing unit, the line-line-processing unit provides the output of the normal preprocessor as a input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessing unit commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you could not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers often have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare yourself with & kdiff3; complete folders to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making any object a proposal to merging; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate and simulate the simulated changes, without creating them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either by all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are assembled, folder 1 will be used as a basis. if no target folder was specified, use the diff3; folder 3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, do not run the merger, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress. if you remove the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & diff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that was found during the scan, shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double or by clicking on the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions with which you can open all folders - or flaps.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you want to double click on a file, the file file is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other file, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object. in such a case, the conjunct action can not be selected automatically. if the merger is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, the color is identical to identical entries, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder will be regarded as the same when all of all the content is identical. then also folders have the same color. if folders is unsignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if a does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no expeditions have been given. then select & diff3; the required action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical to: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user can see as the visible filename for the output file just B; direct after the coupling & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are assembled, then select the option of reset file (uncertain) then the date of files and beats the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date must be identical, but the date is identical.. Soller cannot be removed, the merge of the folders can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While joining the other, a file is done after the other. status column shows Fertig, if the assembly occurred successfully, and according to other messages, if something unexpected was finished, you should make a last review and check whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If a proper Analysis method is selected, Kdiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soluble conflicts will only appear when compared to three folders.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either lead the selected entry (file or ox), or selected all entries at a time. if you have selected all collisions-actions (also in all sub-folders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a target folder, then in the Three folder association mode C will be used as the goal, when two folders have been selected and synchronizing in synchronization A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target folder, please check if all entries should be shown in the folder structure, too. there are some options available through the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to perform only the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If uncontradictory data types exist still uniting actions, a message appears on the defective elements. they can then choose a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window with the options lead to perform Simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulation when you want to see what would happen to be done without the really changes. you get a detailed list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is needed (merge of a single file), then a merge window will open (observe the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select a directory entry / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & diff3; his work continued with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will review some error messages which will help you to select the cause of the problem. so you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem before you continue.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been arranged individually, this entries (in the current session) and performs it together with later. even if the compositions have been transferred or not saved, these entries will be considered as done. only if you change the merger promotion, these entries will be summarised.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & diff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3) has now set up a section called directory association with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the specified pattern is indicated in the Elemental tree. they can be entered in the Elemental tree. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (such as * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that conform to this pattern do not appear in the Elemental tree. it can be entered in the element tree, use the Semikolon; as a dividing sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that conform to this pattern do not appear in the Elemental tree. it can be entered in the element tree, use the Semikolon; as a dividing sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a leading point is marked as a file. this option you can decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2406">On links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic checks are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links will show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is switched on, the version will be switched on. if the option is switched on, you will not refer to possible records and recursively (please note that this option would lead to a final grinder and put down to diff3;) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Leads a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistic columns. (the number of soloster, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster, only to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage is a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly, does not take a real comparison. the files will be regarded as the same as they are equal to. this can be useful for example, if you have lost the change date. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activitioning mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of the combination of files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of a merging copy of the newer file as action. (this is considered insecure, because it's the knowledge provided that the other file is not changed too.) This option is shut down in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original. if an old backup file exists with the .original extension already exists, this will also affect the normal result of individual files, not only the togethering whole folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the file association view does not become visible in the combination of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window / text windows to turn on the windows in the window menu and turn on to change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double click. however, you can also run a file menu directly without the folder. if you save the result, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged once you run the file.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost when you read the directory again: list -menu: reread</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open files which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file using an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undoder. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mapped. (# - &gt;% 23, vacancy rate &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link displayed on a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no option to edit permissions or change date. hence the permissions or change date from the original. (please read the option to the size of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently used as differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first to start the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse on the differences viewer and then select Indiff3 Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & diff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a Kpart, take & diff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & diff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3 Part. please note that it does not work when any original files exists. Moreover, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since production of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; it is executed as a part, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the same from folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's compile) is already available. also the name Kdiff3 has already pointing out that way it can lead like the diff3 out of the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I am using GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot about the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have not compiled the program from the sources and configure the command prefix to KDE. in the default configure, do not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. at diff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as the same, but if only one non-white sign is treated, the line will not be treated as not the same. if necessary, next, next to each other than this is, this is is subject to the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format which could save that information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The cost for this was so far too big. you can always recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly lt; No src linch; appeared and the text can't be extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; use already many colors for lifting differences. even more emphasis would be confused and missing the purpose. please do not use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; use & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how you can use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChallLog or in the file ChallLog in Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To use & kdiff3; mounted on a system with & kde; used to compile and install the command in the base folder of the & diff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-you gives the folder in your system, in which KDE is installed. if you are uncertain you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & diff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems with compiling. you should have difficulty finding problems, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists from it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or changeover) copies in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or changeover insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not therefore in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folders with the function of updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries indicated which are differences. this also leads to that identical files will not be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are missing after the merger. (the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version probably.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working areas. it is quite convenient to modify the running programs on the surfaces, to modify it or move them. this works in a working area as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display any virtual working areas as well as in the current applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Cpager; the motion is possible within a working area as well as other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked, if it is clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; if you click on an application within & Kpager; however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as entries minimize, maximize, on workspace and exercise. commands are following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of the working area. only appears when it was clicked on one application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when an application was clicked on one application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this box is marked, Windows can be moved within & Cpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the name of virtual working areas are displayed in & Kpager; the names of the virtual working areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual working areas. if it is located along with the name, the names will be marked with a deposit, & eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each workspace is also displayed as background in & pin.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty workspace will be displayed in order to allow the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map. note: pixel map is just recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here is the arrangement of the & Kpager; the main window is well known: classic and kpager; in some other window managers are known; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal and perpendicular in a vertical series, which is suitable for display on the side of the working area.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display windows as symbols or contents. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Clicking on the right mouse button within & Cpager; and after selecting a switch, you can set up the dialog for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this is not yet changed in the dialog for Settings. however, you can finish it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not need a write permission to login or to your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the key windowTransparency mode and assign a value for this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2500">To clarify it, even if & kmousetool, it helps to avoid pain in the mouse, it is against pain caused by moving of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can fall for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click, once you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart diver has been activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it's pressing the mouse button is waiting until the end of the motion. in this way, you can run the pulling out of the mouse. in this way, the smart phone requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement you have to go, before & kmousetool; a mouse click guides you.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If smart is switched on, the shooting time is active (1 / 10 s) is activated, the time is adjusted, the & kmousetool; after the suppress of the mouse there is waiting before the mouse starts again, if there is no problem for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports a click on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow move on the left and return a double click. this moves will be stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes .txt for the first time, but they can be altered later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can set & kde; to make the reaction time to be shortened. open the & kcontrolcenter, please go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the rider. there is a slider sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is tagged, & kmousetool; starting at each start of & kde; this function is currently under & kina; available at GNOME or other windows environments, please insert the respective documentation to figure out how you get there a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values that have been set when opening the dialog box. if you have already pressed the button, the settings are reset on the status after pressing the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent move, you should initially be switched off when you click the automatic mouse click, you can get the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that doesn't show a link, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can use the mouse in such places until you want to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is sealed, you should clean your mouse. it is normally fairly easy. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse balls, but also the rolls that enter in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse balls. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear, if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the reels. these are located on the sides of the floor, into which the ball was used. the trick and contamination you can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system does not break the design of & kmousetool; if you just use an shooting down. if you use it in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can't stop by the drawing of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to carry out the cursor over a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but if you don't want to bring your mouse on a neutral area of work area, if you don't want to bring your mouse clicks. safe zones for the mouse curb are & eg; gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to use the smart phone, but I do not create it to edit this text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart diver is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it into the clipboard, to move it into the clipboard or move it again. but there will probably be problems for them. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart diver not only when you start to start & kmousetool; select text instead like this: perform a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and put the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. so, when & kmousetool, the mouse button is played like a mouse click. so you know exactly what to use the smart phone. later you can use it without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to be able to use & kmousetool; you must have the XTest extension for & X Window; which should be installed on most of the system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; provided the mouse button on the mouse as soon as the mouse indicator has been developed. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and to those who are the killing of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2625">News have the next sign-highest priority. a message is subjected to normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the news. while you're writing a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & kmouth. please welcome someone who just entered the room. & kiss; -alerts are also news. read about this news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are easy text-up. each job you specify from the card card orders, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text applications. text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that do not have special rates.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order subtypes are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a preread, this issue will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen resolutions. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text applications as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and continue it on the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Syndrome Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to select text for a language output. this standard includes stamps for the control of voices, speaking speed, the sound of voice and sound. also marks for the control of the language of e.g. abbreviations.

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filter (SDB filter). SBDs must start in single sentences, as only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also stop or stop or stop, even if the language synthesizer is not supported directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional detection filter. during the first start of & ctts; it is automatically set up for a set of limitless filters. you can modify the settings or further propositional detection filter, however, it will not use it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the simplest you will learn the establishment of speaking selection by clicking on. switch on the ticket selection, such as speakers & ktops, select a few features and check out how the speaker can be changed. to this, you must of course have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& button; then faster with the prereading, since only the first sentence can be processed, and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then be able to stop or break text orders on the card card, even if the language synthesizer function does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal rate of proposition is automatically set up for the first time. it cannot be shut down, only removed. do not change anything in this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional detection filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulated mark (decimal code 8) to the propositional sign (tabulators are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard propositional filter filter retains the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD Filter will never be applied to & kde; messages (kills), warnings, messages or the output of screen resolutions.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you are able to remove the normal propositional detection filter, you can insert it again by using the file standard _ sdrc using the file standard _ sdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card reader you can write the speaker settings for application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top on the card card speaker). in other words, no spokesproperties will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the matching speaker, which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker. if you don't delete or edit the settings of the speaker. otherwise select & ktops; otherwise it chooses & ctts; the speaker looks, which corresponds to the originally introduced properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Here, select the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property has to have priority over other features. you can also bet several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the issue is, it will be rarely used as a priority feature. if you would like to specify this property. if you want to specify the attribute if you need to specify a certain application text in another language when working in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field of speakers, which is most likely to delete the text, click on the select button standard speaker and then click on speakers which corresponds to the most common.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is available for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>

<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is crashed and & ctts; probably you have to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command station register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can attempt to update GStreamer or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work when I play with another application music. if I keep a text order, friert & ktops; a message appears on the & console; a message that says: volto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts have to occur in ALSA, which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-projected.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kti does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio, there is a setting speed. that this works, the program SOX must be installed and can be found via the ambient variable PATH. some Synthesizers, as Festival Interactive, offer an adjustment for speed. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored, if & extract; (this is that the HTML can be converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or if you are very courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to-SSML Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create it that websites can be read with a female voice. I set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta the day Sable Gender does not seem to work. so it does not produce any mistakes, the XSL file makes the XSL file to converting SSML. the same applies also to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a single character string filters and now I can finish in & ktops; not more full-purpose or return. on the cartiliter orders, the order will only be taken from one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2797">Best use a command to send the language output to a temporary audio file (wav), instead of sending the output directly to the audio equipment</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcentre; that allows the administration of the network interfaces, routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by K Menu kcontrolcenter; can be called..</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & networkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the administration of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from & knetworkconf; create the user a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; shown. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical tools and their driver must already be functional and configured to do so & knetworkconf; the device shows at all and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases device drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing & Linux; with installed and furnishings. network devices are added later, the drivers must be charged by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded if the network settings are selected in & kcontrolcenter; -index will be selected. when starting the module network settings, this system will automatically detect the system using the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the suspension choice is offered. it's the platform to choose the distribution and the release of the best. by selecting the adjustment Not-again, the defining can be taken permanently. when next start of network settings, this selection will automatically be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings are possible only in system management mode. before, all options are grey, which means that the settings can be considered. in the system management mode, you enter the system management mode at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The full functionality of the module is available in system management mode. these are divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is designed to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices will be displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks are to be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up a set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the button, click the dialog with further improvements.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched by a DHCP Server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, no further settings are required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">You can set the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address you need to set the required TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask, the network mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system draw the network interface during booting. if the initialization does not wish, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values specified in this dialog will appear as the properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be sure that the IP address of the network is not already used in the network. ping to a TCP / IP conflict with ping at & console; you can determine if the requested address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs, or switched off or switched off. switching from the list and click to activate interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs. set off the activated network unit by selecting the list and click the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface has to be selected as a network where the gateway is the gateway computer.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces the respective IP address. this is necessary to understand the computer only IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.inedomain.org calls for the DNS's name to an IP address such as approximately 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the equestrian name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removes or altered .DNS entries can be up by selecting a contract and up or downgrading in the list with the buttons, or download it in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button to add... from the group of calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added to the name of the new name server.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button adding. the entry will then be inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group of calculator to the namespace, select an entry and then click on the button Edit.... It will be displayed the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of familiar computers describes the name-to-IP address of the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for boats when there is no DNS server available. in small, closed networks can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains several entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported, and there is still some special IPv6 addresses in the test.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The dialog for New Alias will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the button adding. if the well-known machine has several alias names, de button adding several times and enter another alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an name of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can run one of the following tasks, then with clicking on OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings specified in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, you have to activate the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of the binary distribution (usually rpm packages) it reaches when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's just download the rpm package and in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with grazing surface as a package or the installation tool for their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & cnetworkconf; the following commands ought to make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology are given, in the second, all of & cnetworkconf; responsive configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been found that it is expected to be in the near future. these description are therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the network administrator, which will be available to a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can't be selected as desired.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a own small (home) network, IP address should be chosen from a specific purpose for this purpose to avoid IP address transactions with the global Internet (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be set up for such machines due to the attitude of Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the field is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is set on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback-address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is needed for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so that it will not be surprised, if in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as defined.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by scripts to the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to put several archives on a band. the second goal was to put a surface for tar, the second goal was the responsibility of a question that my wife introduced: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be bound by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; spin the band back and reads the pretensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; the gueraman in the band will not be asked if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the foreman, searches after the appropriate index on your disk. cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In front of the end of the tape, first binding has to be solved first. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; there is a change to the symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the band can now be cast out without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; it is necessary to be formatted by & kdat; being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must be formatted before being used to store data. this process does not conform to formattter with & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before use by the band of & kdat; however, floppy disk drives usually have to set a form of belt drive, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the band is lost! after completion of the formattage the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you contagate the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only receive this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so-marked files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right button of the mouse on the local file tree and choose from the Menu bar...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the fuse was introduced, the dialog for backup will open. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears for backup. the dialog displays the progress of the securing process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive. it will only be the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a tick. there will only be the marked files and / or sub-folders.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog for Review Settings. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears to verify the progress of testing process as well as the rate of data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can run the restore, the files you need to be recovered. this can be done on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry level. it will only be selected to select the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. it will only be recovered as selected files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Please click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the files and select it in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog for Settings appears on restore. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the workfolder for the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears again. this dialog reveals the progress of recovery process as well as the rate of data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index on two ways of the belt:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the just marked files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, it is true that only the files can be secured on the same file system, as the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can add separately under backup files. each entry will be viewed from tar independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup file, a snapshot file will be used. only the files backed since then have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that used to determine changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all the files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & plagued; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path for the belt drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-reversion of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat, before the band is attached to the drive. in some drives this is necessary to run before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tried & kdat; the output of the tape drives are unlock. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, loosening the integration of & kdat; automatically cast the tape off. use this option not with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tried & kdat; the hardship block size can be changed for the tape drive. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to do & kdat; in any case the block size will share for your band.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band format is formatted, writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file sets together as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is the host name: seconds, with the host name of the full name of the system, on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to be used with the same name in the $HOME / .dat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be manage directly to & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they do not have incredentiality.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Try the contents of a backup association. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kshaft log; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables you to get information about your system. furthermore, it enables quick access to information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kshaft log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don't know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksendlog; experienced users the fast access to the example of information on their server. & kshaft log; thus trying to provide some extended functions, with their help the protocol files can be filtered and analysed.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & kshaft log; a number of useful features. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the other chapters of this hand.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & kshaft log; functions are available, with the help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start is trying to open & kshalog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system is not displayed, so you have started & kshaft log; very likely you do not start with system administrator. the protocol files are usually normally in / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar in order to filter according to a selected criterion or according to a selected string. in the default setting, the selection box contains just displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns indicating the string search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select the string of the filter search term then only with entries in the correspondingly selected column. select an example in the filter bar the name of a process, so displays you & ksanding log; all the protocol lines, which were sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level error are displayed with a conspicuous color as protocol-lines of Level Note. the color display of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in system Protocol or in the cron Protocol), then you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process, if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to view all the new protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kshaft log; allows the display of several protocol-files in separate differences. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage additional windows. once you have selected a window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kshaft log; has a own website at http: / / kshaft log.forum software software. here you will find more information about the subscription sources of & kshaft log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kshaft log; you can also find in the following folder of & kde; Subversion Archive: kshaft log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, rather known (and also named as & ksysv; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program at the high level of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go to historical aspects here (among others because I know nothing knows: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binaries is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone may try to convert a machine to System V Init without creating a new installation and reformat. that's why you need to be sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc are instead of directly into / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service which you would like to start on another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail; system services does not include such things like setserial that only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is not much use for this. you can also get a rc.serial to / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittab by hand and do the 3. if you have some point out, then get it repair by using the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you get all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no real files are found in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the following command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will hit with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could have a server running, that only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could also have a user -Runners, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so easy-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is easy to say not trivial: simply pull one entry out of the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel in order to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevas or change the position within a level by changing it. thereby, the entry will be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they draw an entry from the range of availability services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed when you pull them into a new range. in order to select it except for a new runlevel, you need to select explicitly from the menu menu or choose from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can be no calculates. in such a case, you will have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no option to restore records that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the various working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another runlevel, use it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">In order to modify the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the tabulator button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu may require a confirmation before it executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they are recovered from & ksysv; changes to the preferences are saved in a local sysysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard lap, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services using & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type of system services to be launched in these distributions simplifies the configuration of proprietary programs in the distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & httpd) are simply finished without the message if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you'll need to save them. either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window is composed of two card cards, the user's and user-group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user or special features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings (Quota), a card card will be generated if you make individual settings. additional card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card statement appears if shadow passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card will only be activated and initialized for at least one built-in filesystem (Quota), and is recognizable (identifiable at the file as a.user / quotas group on the file system). here, for each user parameters can be changed, with limited liability of information in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field of file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The cardboards must be informed about the user's polarity. the standard group where the user belongs, you will find in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select adding from the user or group or click the matching add-button to the tool bar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot word, remove and change the time up to boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, change and learn more.</seg>
