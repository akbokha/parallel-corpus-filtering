although I had visited the U.S. for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American music was read and operated by American writers , American authors .
in fact , this country had such a good pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when I saw 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , which was covered by Julia Roberts as Jura student , who had the Supreme Court of an oil painting with judges who were over his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , forget anything else , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had just increased my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the US only .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you are always something that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I had even written a very nice love letter on its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the au@@ spices and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how he needs to face with his face .
he never stops his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague it express and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ e and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements , and tuned to him in dro@@ ves to him .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number one ever reached from the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ s person , asked me ?
I was able to bring Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people who I had met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alism &quot; program , gave people from all over the world , a deeply st@@ itious person with whom I maintained about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps also did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , that figh@@ ts for life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as their son .
still they still fit to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always helped me and grace to me and my colleagues , to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council helped me much in my career .
these people and those who are represented by them em@@ per@@ ed my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump became its way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the Republi@@ can candidate , they bring to me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people have tuned to Tr@@ ump , because they were either distributed to his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke .
maybe it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us to this situation .
this is super@@ fici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an un@@ ability to understand the ones that act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that these voters , of whom most know are to have voted for tr@@ ump , because they would like control of control of a country that they had disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ ni@@ ck , who commented on the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks down with attention to those who looks like he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( n.@@ d. ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White Against all other Eth@@ nic &quot; ; the word game which is so much means that the big Van Jones called it , exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America welcomes every welcome .
for this country is elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan &apos;s son , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise to say : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religion freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruins , they say .
at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims got a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; there &apos;s a lot of ro@@ ar .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were loud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a strong and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; thank God , &quot; thank you , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ alled .
the country where his son fell , sent him a message .
that is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no more space in this new Americas .
and mine heart breaks me .

from the mis@@ ery of the stars : these Latin American children can not destroy their love to music by gar@@ bage .
the &quot; recycling tool Orchestra &quot; from Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic town Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby beautiful Colom@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has its musical instruments , has an opportunity to overcome them in the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is situated in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and bonds .
but this was changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had ever offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their commit@@ ments across the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI says :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust of the streets to meet their great passion .
they always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for the day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - based on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with prepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez started to transform parts of the case into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ it@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times rec@@ alls F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musicians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , the kids did not know music , and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on the instruments of recovered material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws up the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest , like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beauty .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from gar@@ l to music around the world .
the orchestra has played its music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work will be able to fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that figh@@ ts illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that targeted targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of Content .
in West Africa , at that time it was known that this ship had already been run in Liberia &apos;s waters , before it was seeking the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore raised to us , a bit inclined , to be called a law of this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles , rapidly increased against the ship . they refused to divide one of their har@@ bours and refused to divide it a fisher@@ y base .
&quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the Premier is surrounded by countries that are just refused , &quot; reminds us of Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and then followed .
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the region of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch him to catch fish .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for a pl@@ under@@ ing of fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices cross and protect resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , who then distributed the Premier from their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are equ@@ alled and collabor@@ ate together . they exchange information and are each other for illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ging Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated : what is caught , is hidden so due to it extremely difficult to expand . this is illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ation of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species shall be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing could be disabled through bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions now occur in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
in this case , the individual countries can exchange groups , such as lists , susp@@ ect activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very thou@@ ght@@ ful , if it move on the open sea , by satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in banned areas - such that the ships suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fis@@ he@@ gli@@ z@@ ence , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing industry can refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships can not be sold their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay a number from pen@@ alties , as in the case of Prime Minister .
&quot; it then goes for significant financial losses for the owners , which means illegal fish catch is not worthwhile anymore .
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a division company that focuses on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed Front
the already mentioned platform was created to win $ 20 million to lost revenues , which are losing eight members of the H@@ ISH company H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing in East Africa , due to the region &apos;s commercial fishing catch from around the world . under these , they also have illegal fishermen .
their practices amongst others are number as the sa@@ ils under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , indication of imag@@ ery , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; you can take advantage of the missing international cooperation , and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ bridge organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; previously , a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You are not going to run my harbour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this alloy try to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved more than 30 investigations of the ships .
it has revealed criminal networks to divide the f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found whis@@ per@@ ing ships and found it .
in addition to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can distribute information on illegal fishing across large distances and preserved .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be di@@ gest ships even more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always refined , is also helping to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , ch@@ att@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO , also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be rendered by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information panels . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help you to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
however , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of afri@@ can actually affect influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , president of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship@@ pers worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of that , to get a better picture of that , what does it simply does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run in which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only feeling of crimin@@ als , but also qu@@ en@@ ching them .
ships that were used to f@@ use without license and had barely reck@@ oned with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ ies , as well as fishing boats more licenses .
when F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found the inspec@@ tors there on board locks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is very strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object . &quot; in West@@ afri@@ can disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing .
there are also six countries joined the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with safety , the goal is to bring more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was traveling with false flag . and not only the ship was used without any license and were forbidden to use them .
the ship was still in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time , evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative working methods for the protection of the oceans is actually works throughout the world &apos;s sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezuel@@ ans responded , in whose sight the negotiations led to the political and economic crisis of the country in the void , as they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land Bar@@ inas , in the regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ east federal a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .

many representatives of the opposition were seen in the presence of Pre@@ sidents Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s favour on a fundamental change ; however , however , it was blocked for a re @-@ election of the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the context of the government &apos;s context in the following way :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to restore the country to restore its institutional structures and to join a new government .

the call has been commented on Twitter among other things , as follows :

especially large waves struck the message on police repression in the centrally located north of Marac@@ ay .
there , the prot@@ esters withdrew into the local cathedral in order to protect himself according to their own testimony before the police and armed insur@@ ers .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano spoke in the context of the large La Per@@ la Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial , concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
starting with the Bür@@ de to bear the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation then I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a mag@@ ic@@ ent .
one child under 15 is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not recognize that my father was a thief , the following , and a murderer .
Luis was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ chs . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , which is charged due to kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos Son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a court in front of his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father had begun to take me to the military base , I often walked with us into the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you were friends with one of the ER@@ P .
pass only , that it should not lead you one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought I was fine . for so my father loved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents , handwritten notes , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda , books , just everything .

&apos; there , they are tortured to the prisoners &apos; prisoners &apos; .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , cool@@ box - just everything possible .
everything from it was stolen .
he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects have been shut down and held me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
there they are going to practice the prisoners .
I was lying in , and saw a song that were tortured to man .
she looked like a field of field and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who had just been til@@ ed there .
they lo@@ oted a people with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , covered it with water and pursued it a cargo of 220 volts in the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

the st@@ ank there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful way ... as a dirty w@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew what these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ o@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cl@@ oned with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bare moments .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , an civilians who was also indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ o@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of mattresses , on which naked people were bound with his face - all were bound in hands and feet .
near the entrance , they keep silence on the mattresses .
when my father saw that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you think ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told you at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero stroke there a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information on survivors of civil family , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial , was accused of students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , a director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former Fol@@ lowing chambers .
the way where you came here is also the way , on which the way came here .
if you see on the map , you see that they took about this route and tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came that they should be ro@@ uted .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War Win@@ es &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea of what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was even when I was the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I became clear that war spo@@ ils a Ba@@ j@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military symbols , which one assumes a enemy that is fighting for war .

but if you enter into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ...
that is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this voc@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it easy .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into an house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime , and I answered , And thou , whom thou can@@ yon on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded in front of rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
here we need nobody else !
that was my father .
I have no only good memories of him .
when I spoke in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on whom I bore a jacket and a sco@@ op of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with her home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a pity on this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me for the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to speak out .
&apos; the disappearance of the body is the last fri@@ gh@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I love re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you &apos;re ex@@ cl@@ ed during the dictatorship . but why the bodies disappear ?
why do children bring ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I asked me again the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could not have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
had these people not even families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last fri@@ gh@@ able act , which can be done to man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced , bringing the machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner .
they were sh@@ rou@@ ded and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clari@@ fy it , I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have just the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the idea that signi@@ fy my Father began during a talk when he stood under house arrest .
I did gu@@ ise him about all of the grass , which I had to experience him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no one killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like in@@ cum@@ bent , and asked me what the whole Patri@@ otic patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly defended , actually good were good .
then I cried :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; Na then show me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I charged the first ad placement .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can submit to me that I have been pre @-@ captured . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest nor before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 criminal charges : including serious , in@@ appropriate freedom of liberty in 158 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder with subsequent deaths in five inst@@ ances and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ribera trial ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and in August 1978 .
he was found guilty of crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity . he was sentenced in 28 cases of life imprisonment and in nine cases of pen@@ alties ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the initially 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by counterpart . # Es@@ war@@ state terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former members of the military , former police members and civilian staff .
Pier@@ o De Monti has been kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is an historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working for years for victims for years .
Claudio Ab@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial place was built there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; fear@@ able drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation error in a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month &apos;s witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means fal@@ sely - but maybe even with the Bö@@ nen back and # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance of the entrance and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a village of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also aware of the local time newspapers .
the daily newspaper K@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defective English translation has been removed initially . ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gramm@@ ar not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced .
the police of the Kyoto &apos;s pre@@ fecture were repeated for the translation error . furthermore , she stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked by the translator and that the translation has not been tested on its correc@@ t@@ ness before it was released .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that elderly people had offended because of in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set itself a bit more detailed with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents are settled in accidents , but is absolutely cause to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto &apos;s pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by seniors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in the year 2014 , senior pension@@ ers 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this means its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents increased in the same period .
the name known as the repor@@ ter brought to the version of Article 9 of the light , which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo above the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; is this ( &quot; awesome drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia .
translation defects are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real mine of mine , for this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are diverse .
to over@@ place you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting point of understanding and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active body of the target language - something that is with native languages of the case . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother tongue .
so , a French native speaker should translate the French French name - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could translations into English . this may learn the lack of understanding for the survival , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who can learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign workers , make translations made inter@@ men@@ ding . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
mach@@ in@@ able translations are also common - often with funny results .
the distor@@ ted and tra@@ verse sets that are caused by mechanical transmis@@ sions are showing that this technology can replace no human trans@@ lat@@ ors for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English forums in Japan , among them also the obli@@ que im@@ prints that are often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for sty@@ list@@ ical reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users to Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation defects may be acceptable for acceptable or at least harm@@ less than jewelry or at least harm@@ less . but of big companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , one can expect a careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and en@@ forcement measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ face ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users sent it no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the web recording of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV would not be available anymore .
other online broad@@ casts were also organised by the protests of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positions in the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament on the executive board and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was chew@@ ed , and recommended to ut@@ ilize the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are exposed again to Venezuel@@ an providers .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of dist@@ urban@@ ces .
since 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ itated since 2014 . at that time the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation said to give them money fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission continued to report these as &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national television channels , I filed again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that it is still cheaper than two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a blo@@ cking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two further online broad@@ caster . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
former research fellow at the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that local Internet providers are using DNA . this is a technique through which the DNS servers shall answer certain domains .
if a website is blocked through the DNA , the server is faul@@ ty or refused to call upon request from a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ da@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ched channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who had passed the protests in Caracas , was put into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was located in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still available via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus , Venezuel@@ ans will always be worth access to multimedia coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are vin@@ ified to become a slave .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina figh@@ ts for the rights of children and gather testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who became exactly as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ender cows , accident schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas there is a girl who was forced to work in Paraguay with more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money transfer their minor son or her minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what does not mention , is that the children do not have in@@ numer@@ able days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised .
this practice , as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay thanks to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that figh@@ ts for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - gathered testimony of testimony that den@@ ounced and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas guarantees to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double t@@ aller , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
as one is on the other hand , the family who make their daughter in the faith that she would improve their training , improve their position in society and can make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which just@@ i@@ fies the girl with itself and just@@ i@@ fies their exploitation with faith , that they should give someone a chance , who wouldn &apos;t have any training , and maybe even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn until many years later .
sometimes they never know from it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed more intense stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former members of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house at V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck a stick with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last pun@@ cture in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or C@@ Omni@@ cu@@ ela , the deeply in@@ treated practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is responsible for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there are no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows than children are registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without the papers it is much easier , un@@ punished the rights of children to hurt .
it is very difficult to control , under what the terms of boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an effective investigation of the case .
they wish to be sentenced by Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be set @-@ resistant - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go comes before court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be exploited for labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ina was working in her father to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost their father &apos;s work .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the road or on the market for swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in doing so , they had to share the time so that you still remained to learn .
she arose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleansed the refrigerator , pla@@ stered the living room , polished the furniture and the ground too .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more they were finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time also was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to star@@ ve , but got even non @-@ limited food . &quot; I was able to bring me more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the manager , a eh@@ em@@ ali@@ ative military and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party responsible for the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to some evenings , the owner of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand in addition to him and to read the article in opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in this process he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house of the house had found someone he heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they often allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad an@@ hab@@ its &quot; in mind that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native language Guaran@@ i would speak .
they feared their Lord , that they would lose the education that they had made , they would lose .
it was , however , completely clear that they had paid for everything that had paid them from them , with hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated in the school . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , are b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they realize that somebody , who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not leave anyone home at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friends arise , I felt particularly noticeable that I was not one group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which one can divide for cleaning and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators in the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please tell you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleventh year girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she may have small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the inner inner that would like to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author turned out again in the ad once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testimonies also former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z .
in the course of our history , we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice of the Spanish conqu@@ erer , which received the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú that many girls and boys engage in a system of slavery during which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the presence of power are the key to comprehen@@ sion of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register near the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , edited by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently approved a draft law to &quot; the regulations concerning the use and commercial social networks . &quot;
when it is assumed by Parliament , users will have to register conven@@ tions and users of social media in Egypt , in order to ut@@ ilize social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which was commissioned to share citizens and citizens with permission to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register the user &apos;s website with their right name and number of numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it is going to do this , this could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six pages , is defined in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video concepts and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set when it is assumed that the design is not aware that the draft authorities may not be able to register the user as they do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is capable of ensuring the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament and promot@@ er of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users from the telecommunic@@ ations Ministry signed a user name and a password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall to block the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptian women and Egyptians to enter information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not so far known that such plans are made .
experts in front of the site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical mach@@ in@@ ability of the court .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technical Research ( &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights , &quot; ) told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doub@@ ting greatly in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding the things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion they are doing so that just as they for@@ ci@@ bly control their physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , this means that they may request a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens , who do not apply for permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court process .
this is technically quite realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the Constitutional Commit@@ tees before it goes into the plenary session .
whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no further devi@@ ating migration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative template against Cy@@ ber crime crime against Cy@@ ber Cri@@ me , in which a life @-@ long sentence was found guilty of being found guilty of the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ op@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are to be found on the basis of Wil@@ der , loss and fra@@ gment of their lifetime and since they are always less prey .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard , the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the tra@@ th@@ ri@@ ve of the ecos@@ ystem , also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure pleasure .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o had been documented in order to re@@ construct the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; three @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a great earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a nuclear accident at Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is situated in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a comprehensive pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , both experiencing the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring areas of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished the coastal towns of the map .
even with this , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had to have an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o is exhibiting in local view which has been reached six years after that , to rebuild the life of the location based .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as the survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( such as ) , sa@@ vor@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the largest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was posted Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is equipped with 70 percent the final light .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation of accommodation ( such a ) , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , to settle in final spare parts .
according to the three @-@ cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ices , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation of the evacu@@ ation in accommodation and were transferred to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the status of the work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by evil , their doors opened up until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction was far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 percent of fish farms in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i is now back in operation , only 30 percent of fish farms have been resum@@ ed in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is just a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of cultivated farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has largely recovered again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the cat@@ astrophe , almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete image , the newspaper introduced numerous evidence among the native population and under the evacu@@ ated population . they asked them about the status of the resur@@ gence and also how their Recommended has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures taken , measures taken in order to be prepared in future earthquakes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 2.7 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es health prevention .
as it stands for those who had been evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er has addressed their attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es caused , atomic accident , to the Japan ever .
of 160 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were moved to almost 63 000 people outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , to be transferred to permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es areas , most of the evacu@@ ees are still felt older than 50 years old . they have to be able to restore the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive building projects . this involves construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in the year 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences initially seem to be larger than the common ones .
however , after a while , one recognizes that one more combines than it appears at the first glance .
these global connections are important because they want to challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal topics that are often less attention in coverage than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , which are remin@@ ded at a moment in which they have felt very strongly with someone over language and country boundaries .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the common skills of Greek and Turkish ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit : during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against spar@@ ks .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors oper@@ ated him to this Saturday and put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who quickly spread themselves in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures is also recogni@@ z@@ able in the pictures , the face of police officers , identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia and his drummer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would rent a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be visible six months in television and the whole supp@@ ression would thus be justified .
the Facebook page , &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , distributed video in the network where you see how Mat@@ eus will attack by the police officer and several pl@@ umb@@ ing shortly after it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed in a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the shown clip one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Braz@@ ilians Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 euros ) to cover some of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is located in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been divided several times into social networks .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do calls for further violent crimes against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power . here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish presidency joined his father , because he has been sab@@ ot@@ age the military police with a thr@@ ott@@ age . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , who struck him with a stroke .
police dis@@ closure
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to be linked to demonstr@@ ators in the past Friday .
police arrested at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Rub@@ ber stories and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ uties Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media is demonstr@@ ating the street protests by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically to create a broken glass windows in order to elab@@ orate on a photo of the cover pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ on @-@ down bus .
there is no si@@ ze@@ able journ@@ alistic reason , more than a broken window of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognized , if one is strictly damaged against any form of atomic facts .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absur@@ d , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are conce@@ aled by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front course with the police . &quot;
escape of the induc@@ tive villages of Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories included in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Pop@@ ular Church of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , is located in the western Cuba &apos;s western province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill - known for the fact that there is no significant su@@ ck su@@ ern@@ ity on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were la@@ pped in the sugar @-@ tube factories .
in the region , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost its plants and remained in its plants until only the report of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 employees had to be re@@ inv@@ enting himself .
some changes the job .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ uted daily to the factories , that were still grinding .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ data veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar @-@ tube industry do not stick its sleep .
he heard that it works in the east of the sugar @-@ tube factories , which are back into operation after a long time of active time because they were received .
that was something that was not expected .
N@@ ene remembers exactly belongs to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar @-@ tube industry has already the plagues , the fall of Soci@@ alism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ les , the bad administrative decision and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , produced less than 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country for some decades , but the poor yields already exist no more .
why was the Cuban ri@@ cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already looked better .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar @-@ tube industry was a economical cost : the 155 sugar @-@ tube factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive , they were in@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to these measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the debt crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar prize rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar amounts between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .
when the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar @-@ export would generate about $ 85 million for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro came into force during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , there came a total of 98 sugar tubes factories , more than 65 million persons received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word he is repeated in most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all those surveyed are the same opinion : not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place will be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first shot year , the first letters began to come .
the official documents were officially adopted , which would only be removed concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ja Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to auth@@ ori@@ ze any violation .
from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters were increasingly being more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ set factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the yet in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important workplace was wiped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working conditions and services that were included in the congregations in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes manufacturer
sugar cane has been extracted only high by M@@ lay since 2004 .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things change , but not always to the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tubes factory was closed , or even better than they began to take them away , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ e , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without a work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they were shared to spare parts .
without the future , many young people left the region at once .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
ninety @-@ three yields to the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month , to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is not a lying person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that they were told him .
they qu@@ ards him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes up to 65 years old in R@@ ente , not because it is lack of power , but because he is bitter .

First Nations youth use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they are doing so with Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an tour , mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers , to offer youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by pe@@ dago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in Northern Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities , and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will thus be one that the young participants in talks about such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever they enter in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
because workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the British Columbia &apos;s Canadian province and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ neb@@ ago in US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;s first nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway from tears , &quot; a road section of West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not yet resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to con@@ vey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by global@@ ization .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people do not rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ o@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help of Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group , who awarded them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ ebook@@ side of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an stands the St@@ rop@@ he is available in the heading , as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on the earth
this is the day when you &apos;ll get to our cry .
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will lift us one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and prec@@ edes them as well as our youth
this is how they can do what is determined by the Creator
in the comm@@ ent@@ art@@ board the reader and supp@@ orter of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ icon ( which is also published on his blog and re @-@ published here ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes will not only be shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can view almost every restaurant pla@@ stic dishes .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the manner ) , &quot; Pla@@ stic models of dishes &quot; ) will be presented by any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
an entire industry is devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a great number of these small companies that produce those pla@@ gued dishes , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t want them even more . a new trend , however , is transformed today in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Nav@@ al Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i set a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in the special sale : new with plastic dishes made mobile phone tapes to be shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food@@ stuffs were changed to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , such as in this case , cool@@ ant recipes :
here are a couple of Sho@@ ku@@ d cool@@ ers for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essence is increasingly complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular trip with sea @-@ fruits ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
we have found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) for this tri@@ angular bowl .
we also produced this part in the Tokyo station in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone :
designed to see like an apple , with a guy for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach into coma .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers will allow you to restore your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon are used , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can &apos;t make my mobile with salmon ? &quot;
I think , I &apos;m probably the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appet@@ ite form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting of ice .
in addition there are also camper balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and wrist@@ bands of dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ev@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ al Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the Twitter of the H@@ ash@@ tag # otherwise the same .
if you like to learn more about the origin of the trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ e of the Restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico , Ver@@ mi@@ sts and Get@@ ting regularly occur only in statistics , but these are not reflected at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings together .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ man Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
a day after a violent incident , no one looks at the sad@@ ness or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) to give up a voice and stories of people who killed in the battle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
we can not only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug vend@@ ors and so many municipalities must therefore have to drive as many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how much life has changed &quot; ) tells about these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day their father , her four brothers , her husband and two her ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again to the task that we have set ourselves , to go to the tom@@ bs which we have loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th , he was supposed to return again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my Father , but she does not get paid out because they require a star rating .
where should we get them ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ed@@ itors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a vi@@ vi@@ r con el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must not only show the faces of those who are anxi@@ ety . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership .
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what it occurs :
I have been aware of the disease and Sens@@ ory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass a newspaper on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or documents of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one who is da@@ zzle or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal to or consider this as normal .
it continued to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen via the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , that , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear them , so that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories too naked numbers in a stati@@ stic .
the Tat@@ ar@@ ness of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students have been justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; delayed . &quot;
I think they try to talk about that they will be sp@@ ared from their trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and still remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the &quot; Four Mon@@ ths Rec@@ eption in the Main Town : &quot; like a family with thre@@ ats , it describes how the armed crime month was we@@ aned from her business until they had destroyed the business only , but also her family apart .
you think of everything you lost and about how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
pain is never passes away , the grief remains high if you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
they completed their report with the words :
we want the others be arrested , for they do not know when they lead you , or kill you .
I asked me in these terrible days , whether weeping would det@@ ain@@ t my deeper feelings but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of authority created by violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he asks questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a little woman and a man who was murdered in the organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like the other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ ans and he tells that he had to take himself as one egg , boiled potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live thereby .
when he was five years old he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father saw that the armed men had been shot by armed men .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a result of the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of Mor@@ de according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office had 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ a per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that have organised the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who we do not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; in 2015 , the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ co &quot; has founded the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking in which the country has been tor@@ mented in the last four decades in a prudent manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages that he has been bran@@ ched , contain images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or to un@@ mask a f@@ ake .
but how is the year after something is di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ real , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it was used to serve as mis@@ chief , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false vision of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny us the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , questions about our desire to see images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , and explo@@ ded and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to live .
after the civil war in Africa , the second largest country has been negle@@ cted and destroyed . the streets in the region became too dangerous pl@@ ums full of slaughter , the difficult to ride .
trag@@ ically , the fuel tank fell victim .
the representatives will be described by a fire ball that covered the dozens of houses including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who watch the soccer world championship .
houses contam@@ inated and car@@ ded dead bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are lined up on the ground while persons can look at it .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years , the same photo was refresh@@ ed for several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , although it was not to be attributed to the relationship of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the un@@ le@@ gen@@ ic towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies in streets and b@@ üs@@ ch .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one person on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
only based on satellite images the following time could be displayed .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army site in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as proof as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false exp@@ lications ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image was taken to be a test@@ ament to the massacre .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the painting from San@@ ge appeared in conjunction with the fatal persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blows , rape and some dead , some by firing .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ ings like the following on which these descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from a Saudi secret news page that was fal@@ si@@ fied in 2012 , the President My@@ kon@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an . in addition , they had used the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to describe these information .
the original fee , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AFP , as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ an His statement , but had not made the picture of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false coupl@@ ings are going back to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from everywhere around the world .
with the aid of an &quot; inver@@ ted picture @-@ search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found a look at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they originate from a mixed mas@@ ch private page , platforms , social media and shared scientific publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have any wrong reports re@@ directed , others have tried to de@@ lar@@ ed the for@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we also borders examples of the use of the use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they were published . in this way , we want to illustr@@ ate the coverage than by the language alone .
several examples of mis@@ use are from the below listed countries ( which are linked together in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cop@@ pers of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers , more than examples of the for@@ geri@@ es or counter@@ parts are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum , as part of a Th@@ reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not only gu@@ ises the mis@@ use of the images from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions according to the intens@@ ities of the persons and of the wrapped tragedy ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
this article about explo@@ sions in Nord @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , will be identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica is cited as his source of the Spanish News agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ ies according to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo in order to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; quite clearly did not see pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster which contradi@@ ct this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the picture since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then by a post of U.S. American , anti@@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator in P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continue in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize in Myanmar . &quot;
this article brings attention to the continuing distress of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but the work of an article of Indian Express incorpor@@ ates the image from the DR Congo ; the item of Indian Express had not contained this picture at the time of publication of our contribution .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; As soon as possible !
pursuant to the evaluations , in accordance with the evaluations , in the respect of the hier@@ archy , the provisions of the relationship should be avoided such as such as such as ε@@ r = ε@@ r = ε@@ r . &quot; ( warning !
the sho@@ cked photo , which you have ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was ref@@ uted by a Greek architectural check @-@ in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of Stud@@ ents of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the illustration of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the old city of P@@ ie@@ di@@ cast@@ ello from Tren@@ to posted this news to his site to express his solidarity with the massacre of Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo as a proof for the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o , in public discussion groups .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia provides two extreme example of the use of the images from the DR Congo , with one hand of sympath@@ y over against the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacres , and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the asser@@ tions that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , because the photos of them were ab@@ ro@@ uted .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar published a representative of what they were used as &quot; deliber@@ ated news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ ting that has appeared exclusively on English , includes references to f@@ ake images of rum@@ ours , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and they are used by most extrem@@ ist groups to kill the Muslims of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other rum ( what is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to members of the Rus@@ so @-@ orthodo@@ x parish , is clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news broad@@ ly maintained that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an had been granted to being in 2012 that monks and politi@@ cian participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the photo taken out of San@@ ge .
the article was updated 2014 and currently contained in this publication is the picture still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the k@@ illings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ha@@ y attack . &quot;
when the picture appeared in circulation with the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contradi@@ ct that there was connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ ag@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleep@@ eth ) .
the painting of the DR Congo has been marked with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ band@@ ed a discussion under Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were considering that events which took place in the name of the Islamic State took greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the painting was we@@ ath@@ ed as proof for the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were recorded in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was report@@ edly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there was a discussion of discussion as this here in Vietnamese and declared it to counter@@ point .
from the embassy in which the painting was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggre@@ gates and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , there are no more tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and probably China .
( data applications with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp do exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and , they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately contains a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
Fr@@ ames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( radi@@ otherapy ) which draw this post . the first frame is focusing on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions on silence , in connection with the assassin@@ ations of Christians by Muslims , or for the defense of Muslims - the assassin@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fresh@@ er uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life .
religion does not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if reading this pictures may not be able to give this pictures longer .
with social media , there are eighty people who are un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ary these sen@@ timent of false and folding information that actual abominations have been wrong and tast@@ ed that the real estate of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the spread of non @-@ violent images have already been deb@@ ited in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the back of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures and viewers des@@ per@@ ate and receive them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y receive emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as the study that sought to work as non @-@ violent media on it ) .
while there are some non @-@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ olog@@ ous experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you &apos;ll have to think about the situation in which a picture must suggests something , which is actually replaced by context or on completely mis@@ used type .
you should also take into account any more investigation , but should take into account how international it can be .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( ex . un@@ translated ) endeav@@ ours to offer a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or even at all .
such words are in each language : press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi Arabia ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brakes ) .
but all resist hard @-@ ne@@ sting in any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not satisfy for which a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; vak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ try to do your parents in recognition of how to do you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The Be@@ qu@@ int@@ ality or sl@@ oth which you feel after you have felt in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog About :

sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words , and show how differently , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .

how Sri Lanka comes with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently faced with the worst flood and cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c floods in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun who normally uses the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ ter@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following a statement by the cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c centre of Sri Lanka , of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and sl@@ ammed .
more than 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 solid stays .
the rain was left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene levels of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ant and Sri Lanka are regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kas @-@ deadly floods wor@@ sens the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after other rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ all also flooded because of the over@@ flowing water level of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the air force has provided five aircraft for rescue actions and further five are made ready for transport of emergency deliveries to the inhabitants included in its flooded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also been declared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian assistance .

use approved . Dam@@ as in January I took the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour who love her friend .
I trust my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute , we still call par@@ ol@@ es for the rights of women .
in the next sc@@ an@@ aim we accum@@ ulate rights for transfers .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ umbrel@@ las and people , some keep the Iber@@ ian picture of a woman with heada@@ che , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ aled par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks like me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already kept this conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who have known me since years , they have known me - the Sah@@ ar they have known - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which was constructed in its performance .
she caused me to mus@@ cul@@ ate .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practi@@ cing our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim to different kind . but somehow we will all be put into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective performance , this drawer is well constructed in our collective performance , as soon as Muslims , who do not fit there , must be muscles .
the mus@@ cul@@ ated will be mixed
I &apos;m not alone there .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ ic pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one is in the reduction images of Muslims , that the Western books have been colon@@ ise for centuries .
this inter@@ locking picture language is determined by the dark men that men should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Sa@@ id crushed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still standing forth today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are still going to store them .
I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative .
this nar@@ rative re@@ pres@@ ets the reality that have led to nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the U.S. could not even chose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented , their heada@@ ches can be forced to carry out public buildings and Saudi women to cover their whole body to cover their entire body , which both have two sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rative weak@@ ened Muslim women to conduct movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which had been brought to slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has deep and fla@@ vor@@ ous our collective pre@@ ference force such as Si@@ kh men and children to finish an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and ch@@ ik@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and due to the species in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is amazing to capture the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Relig@@ ious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the highest grade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigration of the first generation , come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewell@@ ery design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American statist@@ icians from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re @-@ thought out the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ab@@ ated Muslims and Americans .
but am I wrong and Americans now ?
sometimes , when people ask , why I don &apos;t show any por@@ k meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or carry my hand@@ some pocket boxes , whom all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect of Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I guess , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ ore with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to combat widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ism , th@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit banknotes , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories , which we tell and due to the species in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is more than just a stranger , who den@@ ounce the head cloth .

I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but was born only in my pre@@ ference force , when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : belief , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when she could see the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would like to see the final rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept it in my arms and you have the Arabic verse to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each one of them three times .
therefore , I pray you , that they are protected from evil , the evil one that can see and do evil , which cannot be seen .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of you that I close my eyes , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its fully and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a lot of marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that can be out@@ war@@ dly .
to be honest , the prayers speak , which they said to me , if I have a bad day .
to be honest to God , as she brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , that - over the centuries - by an &quot; Imperial &quot; - a company which has established a company with the name of the British Ost@@ ini@@ dien Com@@ ar@@ ie , has it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging to the affili@@ ation means to grow and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time that my dar@@ kened grandfather is born .
in the middle of the middle , while he writes books about the modern Islam and beyond the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was ruled by his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not able to close his arms in half a century .
the affili@@ ation is to know that it is millions of Kurds and Palestinian who have torn their families like at my grandfather , by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
Muslims to recognise that in the last two centuries Europeans have to have been colon@@ ised to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown over a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ trin@@ si@@ cal sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was designated as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military forces of the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ cti@@ ca , which were disp@@ ers@@ ed to Iraq in order to pursue mass destruction weapons which did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the war of war .
an American Muslims came to know that the suicide bom@@ bers in veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is searching for the USA and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name carries four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad vers@@ la@@ v@@ t and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .

it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims .

we are back to decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the defective and dangerous expression of expression , which we store in our news re@@ productions .

there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who exist in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given , now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .

initiative for Er@@ ror art aims to preserve urban language diversity
history number , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the B@@ CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility to enter here and in spite of a language barrier with someone else ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer to it .
the Global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ translated blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as little languages cannot be passed on to the children born .
for the makers of the Project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities - safe environments where people don &apos;t need to be forgotten to belong to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; listen often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , history counter will initially present their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional history counter , their dedication will lead them and their representation is that the audien@@ ces are transferred on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the history number R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate is also the opportunity to explain to their country typical customs of art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the bun@@ nies and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the meaning of his findings , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience which does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can be able to contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own history courses .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA new consolidation of state debt
with the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started in the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot; ( side@@ front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto R@@ os .
the publication of the re@@ jection of the debt of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os calls for the politicians , ben@@ ch@@ ker and government authorities that are responsible for the debts of their corruption .
we require a financial examination and a cable committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions such compensation , which is ag@@ iert .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a bl@@ ame which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to decline retirement payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ state integrated territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide re@@ structure of government infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk of being rejected by the people .
the demonstration was given the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian Palestinian Web developer Bas@@ ka Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ ka Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , he continued his supporters and to remind the campaign for his freedom and carried out the contributions that he has made an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , which will be held annually to the digital culture that will be held in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who produced in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book @-@ called &apos; Book spr@@ ints &apos; ready books within three to five days , read out of the book Cost of Ma : a Colle@@ ctive Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of sections which deal with the free culture in the presence of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for freedom of freedom and what the real costs are connected to those that are connected .
activists , artists , designers , researchers , scientists and authors , who participated in the movements of freedom of freedom , have worked on page in order to look over the fog that use our news@@ letters and create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ ka Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ unte@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of colleague gives his friends and his family a voice that would turn on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web company for open source and digital activity has been in jail by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place .
his wife , author and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ ka had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; designated command of the military tribunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted on November 12 , 2015 by people who used themselves as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and they were aware of a alleged death sentence against their husband .
his position and condition remain still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand the Internet and know knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Technical ologist and currently over@@ run the ladder by New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
in fact , no one of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was predic@@ tive as the work that he started working with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the displacement of numerous civil@@ izations and merge here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ly traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would be everything to it , this architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip train into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time clause which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
trag@@ ically , the base of this project could not yet be shut down yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with them , of dreams and Bash@@ an taught me to embra@@ ce them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English at , even when he was already detained in prison .
I learned to read English good , write and talk .
he always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught others who taught English to write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he has also taught other in@@ mates , as they use computer , at least theo@@ reti@@ cally , without the fact that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a rehear@@ sal which she wrote in January 2012 until 2015 , when he was detained in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together with the book a year .
she took the lyrics to him when he visited him , and he translated them from the Arab into English .

since the beginning of the protests against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or destroyed under violence by the regime were tortured or executed .

the stories of many other people remain unknown .

we now repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption and sentenced him back to previous post
Mozambique responded to a corruption of corruption , in which a governmental member , after the half of his sentence , returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which the corruption was committed .
it is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused .
the money was taken of public joints at the airports of Mozambique , whose Council was Chief Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ setting in the company , what happened on April 19 .
in compliance with a position of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which gover@@ ns the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a to get back his old position , as the company was no discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short of C@@ IP ) , is an local institution dedicated to public transparency , den@@ ounced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to address the director .
pos@@ es a return in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware that the company should lead a discipl@@ in@@ ary procedure against the infr@@ in@@ gement of the discipl@@ ines .
however , the company kept silent , however , indicates no appropriate legal steps for application of corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting . &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er to be convicted and sentenced to half of them .
he could withstand lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could consult and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is competent , he has interpreted to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to add damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a will be happy to pay for his silence .
contradi@@ ct !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not sow Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was rewarded by the State because he didn &apos;t believe him , that they would be rewarded to someone in such a way that the state has already declared massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state in order to be an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble monetary source and state itself , this man has become tired , who was un@@ loaded and finally condemned to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to recall that a thief has heard in prison :
Die@@ be belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , cutting and - in the same time - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , as he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is to be able to sell , even the country for its amb@@ itions , its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes itself , my experience shows that it is not the same . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn from its amb@@ itions .
an ambitious human being is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also canc@@ eled :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was 10 years old and was released .

Facebook is the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means a chick@@ pe@@ se or split age .

according to information on Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their post@@ ings from the net , because they abst@@ ained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or used as ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tively . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or the extent that ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese scripture ) as part of an initiative to enter the widespread problem of the Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
in the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ dic@@ tive cal@@ onn@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than Hass@@ i against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the endeav@@ our , to fight against it in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ sel@@ ess content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism in conjunction with rac@@ ism , but the word at itself is not rendered automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Post@@ s in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts purposes of his use , were licensed .
Moreover , there are several bur@@ mi@@ red words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written down to Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ read@@ iness ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; Cal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ ison A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was still er@@ ased today , because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends of spiritu@@ ous species , whether they were w@@ anting to relie@@ ve his back pain , as he did a word play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) is quite different , but the context is quite different , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different responses to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ath is the opinion that it is likely to reduce the pron@@ unci@@ ation of radical nation@@ alists , but he also emphas@@ ised that Facebook has been analytical to spread out demons in the suspic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ hook .
what it should do instead , is carefully analyzed by the post by checking it carefully , in@@ spect the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ read@@ ings ) .
the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists are spread the city of Hass@@ ar , a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the promotion may send a strong signal to all , it may spread the efficiency of this strategy not long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of key@@ words often become a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are easy to start to express a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ at My@@ at described as Facebook to extingu@@ ish his post , when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... as I was atten@@ tive to these new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my fac@@ ebook friends that the Word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post of Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden by li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post &apos;s Post has not ratified the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of people removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or who are simply trying to show their opinions against the Al @-@ radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ ler :
post without Hass@@ i is removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook is supposed to do more than before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community has to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a well @-@ going intent , rac@@ ism in Burma began to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma , but this does not work .
such words can be used only to bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems that if they have begun without local context or technical support , and have forbidden such words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even as they found out they did not try , they tried not to rec@@ ti@@ fy the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would benefit to them a major revenue , this would be great .
fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of lots of users under users .
rather than take it seriously , users are thinking about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;s not in the context of Hass@@ ar to see if their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ postcards , which have no badge , but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ eric text reads &quot; I want to sit in a chair and watch an e@@ curr@@ y and watch a Indian movie .
only to try out , Facebook is the mail which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the Post states &quot; If you are a doctor , you will heal people ? &quot;

over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologi@@ es and religious foundations have been used to have social networks to expand their votes and their influence .
among other things , it is alleged to heat the violence in social networks in Myanmar in addition to especially in the missile , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been criti@@ ci@@ zed for his failure to critic@@ ise the pron@@ unci@@ ation of Hass@@ i on his bur@@ gl@@ an pages under control .
but instead of simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;s , it would have been better to learn more in context than on a code of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with child to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament has unanimously decided to provide a law which will offer this practice , so that the marriage age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage Act , some members had taken du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ osh@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not be bl@@ amed that the state could not enter the maturity . &quot;
this happened in@@ spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Human Rights , the min@@ ors , every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 indicate that the proportion of children who had already been married to Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the Statistical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 over 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that endeav@@ our to make the laws to the child before , followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support . without doubt , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not all are smooth .
a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns , to say the critics of the child before , they should be dam@@ n &apos;t worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this species of religious opposition imp@@ acted for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime came down to whether the opposition was at all at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite the four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would do it to the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave up a status update on Facebook , which I posted by Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the Children &apos;s House was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and not a single one against it .
after having been decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of the social media users was enthusiastic , because the laws have been changed to the child before .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was clothed in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has been used too much time and unnecessary words that has veil@@ ed the core of the cause , but do you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s almost any price .
while Abel Jackson the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas exceeded that the day was finally fulfilled :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ e News !
the Basic Law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who is affiliated to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the marriage age at Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation for 18 years .
the draft on the amendment of the Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of them present in the vote .
all members who were against were voted to vote for the law .
the child before is not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # the mar@@ i@@ ri@@ age@@ ander ) .
many thanks to all activists who have handed him out .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
a Dan@@ ke to our members .
however , a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
in the months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial stages , should the law be adopted , and he seems to be able to redeem his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law thought it was absolutely right when Mahar@@ aj was thinking against the law , most social media users wish to deal with the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell defeated :
prefer@@ able satellite , if we , instead of keeping the discussion as general , in a way that we may agree to the state in our bedroom , that they may not protect the state that they may need to be mis@@ used by major , hard @-@ filled men who are contrary to them , &quot; would you be ready to carry out the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the standard , although there are laws , which are subject to them .

through the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia @-@ content .
the German @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , mutual agreement to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey is now going to become popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and fans of TV series fight against the blo@@ cking .
although many techni@@ cian Internet users are acc@@ ust@@ omed to use stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been woven from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report of the Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University find out regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently being updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform put on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which makes itself not a complete line of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is yet available in spite of a ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS published about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the lock of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to put snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ zi@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also proved that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ zi@@ klo@@ el@@ .org , an open source project , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ist similar mirrors on Wikipedia when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Cons@@ ci@@ i informed Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks : Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you attack on a different URL that is not the original . what one can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server runs on request for the correct Wikipedia page , so it &apos;s possible to see the content of Wikipedia even when they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to answer the need for nature protection

S@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the pictures that he looked round about it , never satisfied . you were missing with bad con@@ served motives and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ating him to wear it with themselves and to try to do the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ OS , Nep@@ als are trying to get to the international stage .
and his homeland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which guide the attention to Nep@@ als animal world .
he described his job on Facebook as it helps to help him with his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I was looking forward to seeing me suddenly in Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was , and I immediately began to break pictures ! !
S@@ anc@@ ti@@ sts a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ als in order to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ als and wants to make the understanding of that wild animals don &apos;t like the fear of how they look like .
and he should know it , for he stood by face to face toward face :
a tiger can &apos;t be anno@@ yed from the opinion of sheep not when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also because of the darkness in the way , I suddenly appeared in the way , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ avi@@ ks appeared , and immediately we will see and star@@ ved through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked for Environmental Protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and most often lived in a tent to do in Bar@@ dia National Park &apos;s recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger eye and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation .

after the wedding , Indian women gave their husbands for the first time to discuss the names of their husbands

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared to Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of an Content Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India , women with greatest care are to avoid the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ ous person or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
von Ch@@ om@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband and fear of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should get the norm to do this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian state of O@@ thers in the Indian state of O@@ thers , and had the vil@@ lagers from her family and the vil@@ lagers .
the tradition of their wives cannot be mentioned in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less author@@ ization to fear if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une village , in Mahar@@ ast@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , were thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the delic@@ acy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
when one of 56 clubs , which are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ help Bad@@ al , powered by the community video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and uses for the dis@@ assembly of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ fer to the associations of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
it tells us how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion group , was accused of women who do not name their husbands at name .
she decided to decide for this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak according to the names of their husbands , an brilli@@ ance is a custom , and never asked them in question .
Roh@@ ini stated :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this one , is considered a cra@@ fty , as wife without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never done to this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try her husband so far as never called by name , try to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband kept silent , after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should name him by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started Roh@@ ini her first discussion s@@ lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , mainly girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , means that they will not respect ourselves ?
should it not be equivalent to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women are married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands about the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ast@@ ra about the Bre@@ chen of a year @-@ old tradition in which married women to speak the names of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini told :
one woman was so sh@@ y , that during the whole exercise only to be til@@ ted ; another decided to leave the whole fru@@ stration with him and to leave his family by putting him out .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the morning , with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to have their husbands at home , to name their husbands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas found her in his head : his wife was not able to stop his name .
another club member decided to do it when dinner before the whole family .
her mother in her mother in law was afraid , she was afraid , saying that there was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of one participant in was less understanding and the situation was taken in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practitioners , such as the Tra@@ il of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the mar@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest of a red point when he would like it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to bear him .
the other women did not have stopped completely , but my , they are now in a better position to choose it , in some days , not to wear it .
for many women , the discussion of discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we are doing a trip at every discussion .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she says .
during the last months they held their own birth days with cakes for the first time in their lives . they danced and sang about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have worked on some things , for example , such as our ident@@ ities of our husbands , never been so honest .
it feels great to say some things no@@ isy , no matter how small it occur .
in a discussion round we have maintained through the concept of honor and is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried away only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
most of them is OK , but some wanted a sal@@ utation @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a p@@ ants , they have not been comforted .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes han@@ ger that mor@@ ally linked with the Sar@@ is and much more , sh@@ rou@@ g@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion group , so that women could carry them .
next , they now have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
to question whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini has confirmed that the things slowly come into rolling :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then ceased to say the name of her husband .
some of them included , make it still , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two say to the names of their husbands ; only one or two women now bear at each time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ heads .
the women in the discussion lu@@ ver@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the finds around more freedom of movement or the own clothes elections - at the end of a hard to navigate to the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will realize that they sit in the same boat .
how raw ini declared :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people reports about what we are talking about what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

it is the first time that successive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the aim of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN adopted a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government campaign developed to fight these aber@@ ration and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made it recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published at a partnership agreement by Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has withdrawn its attention in international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state of the state ) after having taken part in the draft of democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter . &quot; he told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , po@@ et@@ ess Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow or permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are far off the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has given some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner to the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June , to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Norway Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ end refused to answer questions about Li@@ fet@@ us for release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government told it that it was not able to do nothing with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement for the salmon to China , as exports were largely been blocked since 2010 .
after having found the message , Li@@ u was seriously sick , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was not able to meet his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants to seek .
China &apos;s top diplomatic relations in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , China called for the release of Li@@ us to release in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we anticip@@ ate that China lifts up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , they wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad agreed that the Americans would like to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in the event of his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the Chinese authorities not only release Li@@ u , not only li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US Embassy moved out to an un@@ expect@@ edly answer to China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with immediate remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer a couple of fol@@ lic@@ ans :
protecting and freedom such as travel irrit@@ ation and access to the medical care of his choice , which they have to be used according to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
in addition , the US @-@ Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and T@@ ed Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I challenge China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , so that he may proceed in a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German Government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will get all the medical support that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could be sur@@ rendered to Hamburg &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide an appropriate medical care to provide and give it the opportunity to re@@ produce himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP previously , that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to meet someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada requires China to release its international human rights obligations , including the freedom of expression , maintaining and the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China to release in a statement on 29 June , Li@@ u from humanitarian grounds :
all necessary actions have to be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless of where , his wife and his family will have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information available if France will take him out of the end .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ lands in Taiwan in China called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and require a greater tolerance to those who want to use peaceful funds in order to challenge political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the t@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party of the Democratic Party of China also called for China to allow the sick person in Taiwan , to treat himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very wor@@ ried in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith , that the initiatives he had taken care and for which he was strictly punished , had led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and prosper@@ ous whose China would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and concerned citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , signed for Democracy , Freedom , and Law of China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question is stup@@ id , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the conference , during a meeting of the international branch of the State Chamber of the State of New York , the Minister decided that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ line that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people commit a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable land , we hear that we were not to be a country in the end .
it was so vul@@ can@@ on@@ aire , it had a flight to flee before the responsibility , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ters were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in the face of which , he appeared to be in@@ sof@@ tened .
on the other hand , it has defended that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally between cities committed permanently from a party .
these cities are democr@@ atically .
as soon as you reach the centre of the theme , the good old bodies of the authorized makers indicate to be the dict@@ ory Democrats , because they have turned into their power to be better .
in the final week , the answers were given in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ bra@@ ve answers to his American guests regarding our press , our co@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions clo@@ aked he with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to understand his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to what country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take to clari@@ fy this point , provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by calling on the blog his comment , he pointed out to the critics that one should begin to read the entire copy of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ dic amal@@ gam , according to that Singapore is a city and not country .
read the inscription .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; be considered a country , &quot; explains why the elections in Singapore so un@@ important , even if we are happy to look forward to and just elections .
he beha@@ ved Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t know it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over sh@@ an@@ dic amal@@ gam , as leader of a growing generation , making such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very well ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes this , correct and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have committed an error , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ dy Re@@ placement ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally the country and the city .
since he plays an important role in the governmental office , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam is of severe importance .
why do not the Lon@@ urer of her military service defend her , but only their city do not defend their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity certificate ?
are we the citizens of a country or residents of a city ?
based on the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have many Lon@@ urer to be offended ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city and island nation .
I can understand that we often hear something like &quot; the defense of the country in particular , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct .
we should speak rather from the defense of the town .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his ed@@ itors : what is the most miss@@ able aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world will be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put forward to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived and again in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation where the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite , interested in his talk partners , to show personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , usually the default value is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadian boil may be kept inside of anger when they are kept for Americans , but does not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that the Canadian is different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
so , when I began 20 years ago , I was going to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September .
Canadi@@ ans have always brought small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gender mar@@ riages are legal in Canada already since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we often say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant country across ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are nice people nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends that I ad@@ mi@@ red very much .
it would not account for me if one would change to Johnny from Dallas by reason for example .
Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or by Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; is to be referred to in fact , such as the sc@@ aling , gentle , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ers from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who owns one of their own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of humans such as N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing to which you can encounter .
harm@@ less to be , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and interesting to earn and no attention to earn .
this can be something good if you want un@@ noticed in the background , from things that happen to pass around one .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and only to be the Canadian citizen .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
as a &quot; nice &quot; prudent , &quot; perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian did not talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we l@@ acks a warm , open friendliness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Canadian more than just &quot; nice &quot; are . our Prime Minister has made Canada almost a sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thai @-@ j@@ unta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a musical video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert who seized power in 2014 and restore the government in spite of their un@@ speak@@ able civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( p@@ ha@@ ge Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour explains a young man who tells it that his friend makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the musical video refers to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
in the last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video , &quot; The dict@@ ator , &quot; was blocked after a group of activ@@ ist to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular how it keeps itself with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political themes , which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may be based on the dra@@ stic Section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gave the Commander in Chief of the host to be more important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude , &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; inclusion in journalists &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer de@@ crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to betra@@ y activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the Army , supervised by the online content and accused persons accused of having assassin@@ ated the monarchy .
Thailand establishes a stri@@ ped but@@ t against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Majest@@ y of the Majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the Army .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax @-@ free .
in the video it is shown even how people will be thrown into a black delivery wagon before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sitting in prison because they allegedly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society and the use of internet are being threatened to pen@@ alties that they should leave the monarchy .
meanwhile , the be@@ aser of the band members of the band , which was im@@ ited from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; which had already been used by coup opponents in 2014 during protests in 2014 .

various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreciation , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and Abi@@ bun@@ ny live in the area .
such settlements are also mentioned in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ kov@@ kas are symbo@@ lically to the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls heavily to end this .
&quot; all is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I talk ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now , there are only paved road with verb@@ las@@ ers@@ ed magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan of the Soviet Union in the meantime have abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages see it similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ che@@ ek , which is still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried up .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when she dis@@ covering me with the camera in her hand , they immediately draw back .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl mar@@ ches something to her friend and suddenly abandoned them , destroyed the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ quoise company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ stan@@ cial economy ( cultivation of land products for own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable stock .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles in the winter of winter and bread on villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman went to Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jung@@ le tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia , &quot; says she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted on them , supported by her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente is just 9 dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vil@@ lagers try to meet regularly and celebrate public holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Colle@@ cting party in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembers to the village of Dor@@ ge .
despite the relatives found in central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia simply broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but this will take a little more , &quot; explains it .
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child@@ care for each child .
her husband works in the cab@@ rer .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , H@@ aly@@ ne and chickens .
she tells us that at first a very wor@@ r@@ ying situation was , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark road or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and they all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is over us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy after him .
he plays with the ball , which goes down to the hill .
one group children are now crying al@@ ien@@ d the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones to the falling building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood that help protect their lives in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa houses &quot; migrants in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , in the State of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
this article of Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , cross Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is guided by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als of cor@@ als and gold colored rings in t@@ ed@@ dy Be@@ ars shape .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the pass .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , ro@@ asted walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance hall there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ anic immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come into full bus@@ h@@ ings and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons .
she does not want to refuse any one .
she helps them also and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medic@@ ations that they cannot pay , they massive them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ace ) po@@ ds with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , &quot; yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; I feel really that it fits into her , as African women are very nice women .
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston in order to re @-@ find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America , and then go towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other pioneers of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans speak to What@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his departure leader Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests will send their often text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ate them or report on their journey over the course of their journey .
it declares that Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end of Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela leads to Jes@@ hur@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ ci@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that Bust@@ ick@@ ets will be sold to numerous African migrants .
he started to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground at the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ ci@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells us . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after three years he lived in a raid on his work point out of the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula is coming from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to send money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a well @-@ known , has offered him the roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the gears , the trav@@ ellers consul@@ ted their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that their house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother they cher@@ ished in their album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets , who made her a cli@@ ent@@ ele , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and Old .
she laugh@@ s and she laugh@@ s while she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ zz , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users in X@@ inj@@ ang .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 the mobile phone users received a mobile @-@ to @-@ date mobile phone users in Tian@@ sh@@ an District in the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message , it is said that the app can get access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities finally em@@ its the app for more than the fight of terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app as soon after they had installed the app , messages with a private we@@ chat group .
in the notification of the police , that the app can determine the sources and distribution paths of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service power with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphy , tro@@ j@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of it , how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in various ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote actors or even h@@ acker capable of reducing the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while the messages of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship generally focused on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme en@@ sur@@ fers and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet switching circuits .
the news @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( released . ) , published news in China , showed photos of a chec@@ point point where the polic@@ emen of the residents had passed on whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people are using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
they have been forced to use people who are thought for older people .
this is a form of captivity through am@@ ber@@ ing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( the same . ) released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which means that the software can lift up the password needs of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ conditional access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will be used to electronic handle .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the town @-@ party council that minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all governmental organizations , authorities and with the party , including universities and research facilities , are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computer and communication devices .
there are also a current report of at present House , an American Human Rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released a Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a Regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terror@@ ists &quot; to identify and destroy . this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them fir@@ ming for a whole range of other possible charges , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you can enjoy yourself and make sure that you are quite alone at a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has shifted and dis@@ band@@ ed , and revealed a truth , which is clearly recogn@@ is@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one , which makes all glory to their names .
one that put down in a list of feelings and express ro@@ sem@@ ic@@ ate , not allowing Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality returns again and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the character into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke , and you shall be aware of your existence , even when the earth is lying on the axis of the unknown . it is clear that you are caught between the walls , which your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
they have been arrested me and my father three times , but it wasn &apos;t enough to give me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security services formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us in evidence by changing the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five yo@@ ung@@ sters have been torn during a peaceful protest in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to prevent the city the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all the districts are cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was still , go@@ vern , at the wrong time , even if I put no high demands on a city which is cl@@ amped into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and its compli@@ ces .
during the third night the things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply could stop in the quarter .
I broke through the silence , by taking several times &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; of my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to join together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me . we feder@@ ate ourselves with a practical image that met my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment , you realize that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the least of the poor .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to you , after you have seen it all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I got there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear me when you cry &apos;@@ Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you &apos;re only cour@@ ageous enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his dog @-@ filled eyes set themselves on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know what to look for me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , nothing has to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
maybe it was in my folly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have been forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am no word of what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is in separate and his father like with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father like with it . &quot;
the stone of this floo@@ ding lies between me and today in the nose .
he became a &quot; Syn@@ drome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed for months .
I cry out the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and the second office , which leads through a gang to the single cells .
I &apos;ll find all the details exactly before I supervised the room .
otherwise , they have been assigned a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one additional prisoner , and may immediately place me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I handle on an old established communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me@@ ager &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , he answered me .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells , a well @-@ regarded man @-@ aged , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive visual expression in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are networking of its existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the great cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would certainly ad@@ mitt@@ edly when I stay .
lu@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have an birds to sell all of these cro@@ ws that settle on the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from afar , I still hear &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that told us in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donner , &quot; announ@@ cing on the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this was the secret to protect against us and prevent the terror@@ ists in front of us and to prevent the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ essi@@ onal compression card and rec@@ tified the close sight of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country . it is a curse that they call co@@ exist in order to transform the crime of her c@@ lans into a hero .
I supervised the head@@ room and meet in Abu im@@ d , a sl@@ ender and a poor man ; at least he comes to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant thing &quot; Con@@ vers@@ ation , in spite of the secured expres@@ sions that you are young , you are still young , you can connect so much important thing with your life , than to protest this day , and to protest demonstrations , so soon to find an end . &quot;
I don &apos;t answer .
I was acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to answer .
I can really say more precisely , when Bel@@ ts and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me become an ordinary communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me I said that I had to acc@@ use me or mis@@ used to be punished , although I had nothing done to earn this sentence .
sentence in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker rejoiced at your cry .
give it the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you cannot keep your cri@@ es .
my cry did not make him enough , for why they ex@@ iled the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked once again as a gar@@ bage collection or whether it belonged to normal working conditions .
they had four cables to inter@@ fere with each other , to present the ones from their view@@ point , great invention of a huge cable .
three of them , during one single hour , three of them continued , while I still was in the row .
I had lost all the feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped to cry .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , which is why he saw next to an electrically charged rod .
river flow@@ ed my whole body enough to feed my entire quarter .
my half @-@ like body , which was put out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the divers disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it has to have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again . let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ve young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my dad must be terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
they have always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + Community , free expression and resistance
em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib gets most of his time inside the time . once , he cho@@ oses to his canvas , time to his computer , and again on his couch .
but what can be abandoned , a cig@@ ar among his fingers , or to discover his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , where Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank completed and saw H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine ( about : farmer ) .
for the past six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activ@@ ist , referring to the conservative majority against gender , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ins .
with his music , often sets out with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian prisoners . all these topics are not only in their hometown of Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that are rich from Damascus to Syria and Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib found himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through limits , and he can suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he is not openly available , it is advis@@ able against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib considered his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ ol@@ er of the second generation , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he is po@@ unded in the water @-@ sol@@ uble nest café in two cups . it is the sacred month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
apparently , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ su@@ ous Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
generally speaking of warm coffee and the dro@@ pping of Kent @-@ cigarette in the nose are the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one casts a glance into the neighboring countries .
it is therefore easy to do basic things , to do basic things , as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committee that support the Islam@@ ist leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradi@@ ct and the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ uties and former press conference in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert had been said &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that author@@ izes the old proven legitim@@ acy of legitim@@ ate regime in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement should probably not be sil@@ ly @-@ sil@@ ted rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a clear that is reflected in the crystal clear reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib traditional gender nor@@ ms turned to body by ref@@ using his vision from the fate of arab@@ ic women who have had sex hel@@ pers .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence in them .
over the past few years , the number of Hon@@ mor@@ ers &apos; was seen in Jordan - the in@@ official outside of Jordan .
according to human Rights Watch the number of honorary mor@@ de in 2016 reached its peak ; however , there is still a thing that Jordan was missing to support women who tried to attempted murder or domestic violence to support themselves .
according to a law on the frag@@ ile attacks from 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of internal family violence , &quot; and for their release , often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to re@@ inst@@ ances on topics that are l@@ ent in his own country as tab@@ oo .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ i@@ fies that his work is politically , but there is a dream that he is able to separate his music , the full exp@@ editions of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , husband .
my policy was declared to me , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically in the nucle@@ us can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want , &quot; it is faith or un@@ belief , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of pigs and reading , and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals continued to be greatly cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to note that his comments were torn out of the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that In@@ toler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet from the eighth century , who still has stayed in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic po@@ ems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ er shou@@ ldn &apos;t work once on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century could be open to homosexu@@ ality why ?
the real problem , so called H@@ da@@ ib , did not have M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom it is nothing new , that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian secret service adopted several former government officials and members of the Teacher Association , with the accus@@ ation , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media , linked with the deep in the country @-@ root corruption .
in view of which , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is to say only the top of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian paper .
for him , Pro@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a has now been denied a performance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks like H@@ da@@ ib . it is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ ib was dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs also , from a Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he will not only dreams his work to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be backed by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental off@@ ence , and not due to bombs , stre@@ um@@ bling and on artificial way of the democracy . at least , he hopes it .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to tap and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories in respect of the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is presum@@ ed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually taken up in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the troops invaded by the west of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another wonderful way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high tower was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of your summer !

rarely were the outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help to help the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the fresh@@ er course .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday .
a survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru , such as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can trace this hair@@ style hair@@ style .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ dres@@ ser , who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers of hair@@ dres@@ sers of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts occur against each other to show who can create the exotic L@@ oo@@ ks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos at current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here a opportunity to ut@@ ilize their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip in the hair@@ style art that allows them to find work .
motivated from this activity and dedicated possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to Guer@@ il@@ la@@ de@@ fer

the following article is the version of the Beit@@ er &apos;s love @-@ message to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel free to bring in aff@@ ection ?
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Hostel , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged letters to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , her country was the scene of a historical event , and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government signed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the fore@@ mark of peace agreement was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , in front of colum@@ n@@ ans , however , it is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ ke@@ fer who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock their weapons with themselves , must now be integrated into the life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred , had to record them in their ranks and support them with the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ans join themselves together and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the society .
the aim of the Camp@@ a@@ ign are 6@@ 900 letters - one of each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who will then be handed to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them do more need .
he said he was told to share his love with people in this year , most of the most urgent cases .
so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now will have to build their place in society and make a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th at a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art was travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they did before , in order to meet the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters full of under@@ taking of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved parties . &quot; it is amazing how many different feelings may walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between &quot; and told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governors in the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighters brought me to the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because beside him on bed , a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate was a deadly weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are she just ? &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never before me in my life , someone wrote to me a nice thing , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly came down tears on the che@@ eks .
I woke him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this strug@@ gling , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company that is waiting outside with open arms .
till now , I only learned how to handle weapons with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together to a discussion group .
the students had grown up and grew up as a war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help to create a political party in this country .
for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people have never found hearing , yet they had no elec@@ toral rights , and to recognize that people who had often seen as a monster , and even had learned only people with beautiful feelings that were shot through their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the truth , in which the land lives , does hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed , and have done so much harm to bring us something , and can give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have given to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column has made evidence that , after de@@ fo@@ aming peace , it would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as there are ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
we are putting the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victim , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . for those among us that defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be forth@@ coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ imp@@ sum@@ owa and published its first publication at the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large bandwidth of d@@ angers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and im@@ print .
with terr@@ ors have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ onal value above the dor@@ ny L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only taken over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , which have shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what happened in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines in front of several months after reports were published that the tow@@ ing , torture and killing men in the Republic of the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ y Gas@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , which suspected e@@ ager men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a nurse , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there .
already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she went to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chn@@ ya had experienced the gene@@ alog@@ y of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in fear of her life she moved to the United States last end .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer Hel@@ fer@@ ine with a human rights organization .
one day , I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ wife who put them in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I was trying to help her , he was a friend of my documents and spread it throughout the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men to remove the Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos taken from my documents through What@@ s@@ App made the round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was just doing a few shopping m@@ aturing from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man@@ hood : &quot; here is a gift for you of your uncle . &quot;
when I turned my mind , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on the Che@@ chn@@ isch : &quot; how long will you honour the family , and honour me ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had taken everything together and started to cry .
the man was fled .
women had called a nurse .
in the hospital , I learned that I had taken two key@@ words in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which the wings were placed - in which the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated since there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and put me on the women .
for that I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his brush , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am than@@ k@@ ful for him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
after the last February I was thre@@ ats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , and some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of an Alpine .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the desired to send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they set absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I had to prove it without through the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex at Gro@@ z@@ ny in Gro@@ z@@ ny and I say that everything was only evil , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the whole Republic has damaged .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she made a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dar@@ kened window discs and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 hole .
after the third time it happened , I became clear that there was a little la@@ zy .
my human rights activists review the num@@ bering - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I want to give up their names , but I want to say to them all , they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without record , without reference , without everything .
I broke my old SI@@ M card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived at and check@@ up into the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you believe not about , you warm@@ est in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you are on . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gene@@ alog@@ y , however , this is a table theme .
I &apos;ve always wear some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ sia elements still in me .
I do not wish to overcome this spiritual barrier . I can &apos;t overcome it .
I always say that as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ apped with camera , I really give myself effort to look like the person they remember from their past , so that I remember my male shape .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I was talking about someone who made a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told us that during the Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was hardly able to wait , and he did not switch a new wave .
most likely they are now on family and relatives .
thus , my I , they probably re@@ load the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end , a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood satisfaction has experienced .
OC Media : will now also be imprisoned in these secret products now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there would be very many .
if , above all those who have not enough relatives or who were left of their relatives , to present Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are arrested there , so that they can be used as terror@@ ists later .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as a result , these men would not have disappeared , but targeted to radical theory .
OC Media : is this now just a dirty or do you have a source of that information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just spent someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun on one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was taken by themselves as these people were taken away .
but now they were not presented as a band@@ ed , but there were yet no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave this person ?
do you know whether those per@@ secu@@ tions and de@@ ways of people , which have a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation &quot; took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I had been wearing my hair always long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I had never problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to bring us to the &quot; Civil@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but did ultimately go back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were gro@@ unded , I had colored eyelashes , bore Rö@@ om@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security ministry of the Sch@@ aria is never trimm@@ ed by a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where you arrived every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ ing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da , which is : &quot; sp@@ ans not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often says to children , when they make mer@@ ging over sick people .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never hurt me , never beaten and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this benefit look like ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak in television over Mor@@ al .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
yet - you could feel how people began to catch in the city .
he who had promised and laugh@@ ed before , looked at the same with suspic@@ ion .
in that time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I deser@@ ved not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the US .
apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , Con@@ ferences , I understand them to the hospital , and help them to get food types .
I &apos;m not a cent for this .
I discovered these people even when I revol@@ ted a curse .
I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry any Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ av@@ ant .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no pigs at them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , who also have Russians ; on all the planet it is - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
so I get from there , that is why it is un@@ pleasant to listen to something .
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them , pract@@ ising Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting in the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ scripts to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his family to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a chest .
these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be precise , different living settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and will not be ashamed for my body .
not , whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I am so personally personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups prior to an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the past few months there has been a strong increase of suicide .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the stag@@ gered situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety stands , depression , and he em@@ it himself to his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to gain un@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had burned himself .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide bom@@ bed to him in August inside the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activ@@ ist activists from the spot that even more men could have life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ke Tam@@ bo Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have a thing common : they were all family fathers , which are based on the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able , to nour@@ ish their families , and to keep their safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , was shaken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it hard to endeav@@ our to the local Arab population to contest her life .
prior to a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took the power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and precious usable space for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continue to continue to slow down slowly , and the native population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime denied the A@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arab@@ ians system@@ atically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ men , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om are to der@@ ive .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation and devast@@ ation in the region , and local agriculture , as well as fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab ar@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Ko@@ h , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who had a job , completed elementary school , and 55 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activists with residence in London told that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist eth@@ ical discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ah@@ wa@@ z new , ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process :
as officials and institutions do not rely on Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will res@@ ume access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which causes it to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their lifetime outside of their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their pre@@ ference and sur@@ name , in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , sof@@ ten because the speaking of the Arab language or the Tra@@ ging arab@@ ic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must suffer , human rights activ@@ ist alarm activated before the situation will explo@@ sively .
it remains to wait if the world aw@@ aken and notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treatment and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why do I do not cooperate with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ se@@ ction . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was the subject of several discussions where many different locations came to the expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a fem@@ inist , they react to many women - especially the white women who signi@@ fy themselves as inter@@ se@@ cular femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they are wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a fem@@ inist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same formation .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women before or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that any discrimination on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all of this is aware and known .
I &apos;m convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , on ra@@ ass@@ ism , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I chose to mention any kind of physical , spiritual and banned women , both in and beyond the fem@@ inist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to mention the femin@@ ists of femin@@ ists .
but they are all interested in fact that women - all women are gathered together to lift up their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos;s , to sing the equality of equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to speak that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institutional form of ra@@ stic violence that we have been exposed to black women on two different way .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ as and women earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are more often referred to as the school as white girls , due to obvious integration issues .
or that women in black don@@ ors and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer , domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
on one hand , I want to have all women , all men and all men , neither any skin colour that have any rights ; on the other hand , I am unable to consider the white woman to take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , that relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and I will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ inist @-@ oriented sphere , that has always rejected me and countless other black women always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also ref@@ using me to just@@ ify an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human being and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ref@@ ills me to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs in order to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will not try to dis@@ close white women the importance of the cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to dis@@ close the importance of black women for fem@@ inist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better .
although Inter@@ se@@ cular femin@@ ism was founded in order to give up a home to women in different information and to abol@@ ition of white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I go ahead of myself , full and entirely of femin@@ ism to join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of me for a white fem@@ inist para@@ dig@@ m that is so hard to use as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and engage in the Sp@@ aces , which will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves to our own kind , and not only that - black women may be able to keep the spiritual , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements that make the black woman .
although some white and interactive femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of fem@@ inist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am acknowledged due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment , in which my life was neither addressed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
pro@@ del@@ eting against pollution : the mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of an Content @-@ Shar@@ ing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to realize people the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who declared to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution in its municipality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country will fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust explosion , contamination , and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Art - a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender Alliance - who lives and works in order to protect rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a holds the gravity and importance of his work in question together : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and published .

Paraguay and her more difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ er Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ arch sigh@@ ing ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected people .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they don &apos;t have anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her express partner who has been active in comparison to violent .
since the end of its relationship was a little time passed and the police spoke , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later , the second wife moved back their ad .
the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women refund ever at all , they do not receive support from the state in general .
in many cases , women also depend on men who have mi@@ stre@@ ated . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
content and Statistical Bulletin 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that has nothing under@@ gone 3 Paraguay : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation beats and statistics
it &apos;s hard to determine how many women really are mi@@ stre@@ ated , says M@@ yri@@ an Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ ies at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socialist research centre in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there went a case of domestic violence against women in the district of At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of the ads were occupied by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peac@@ ekeeping forces . here , 86 % of the ads come from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic Mis@@ sions .
however , these statistics show not the true dimension of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these pen@@ gu@@ ards are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who will not do in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who will be refunded because of physical mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , two women who do not do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay was not an independent criminal law , the prosecution authorities cannot be documented appropriate , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of traff@@ icking in women in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
after their estim@@ ations in Paraguay , all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that has nothing under@@ taking
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the solid girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all their former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that it was supposed to regre@@ t it for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult :
I never thought that I would be victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read it earlier , I thought that only women have happened to sub@@ mitting them , because they are dis@@ gu@@ essed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote entries on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen like Carlos of Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed like that , when they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions had at least a certain fellow at it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner is mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
in the group they can speak with others on their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner was able to convince her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements with the authorities remained without the result and also of their relatives , they had no support .
she carried a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly to money , power and influence of their former Partners .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very well , but not applied .
the ad of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a draft law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ ag@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ obj@@ ections ) are part of a campaign on Twitter being supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d insi@@ sted to explain to an independent pen@@ ance , as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text in some points changes in some points , so that the dep@@ uties for the law would be feared that the way for the crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be prohibited , who are generally forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the original bill had intended to bear the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process , which have to bear the victims of violence themselves , if they just receive an indication and want to obtain a secure accommodation to the state .
E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gued that the law does not be effective , if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funding to this law :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relations .
here , a change@@ over must be held so that violence is no longer considered a little .
in view of these facts , the perpet@@ rators will be guilty and contributes to it , that the perpet@@ rators will come .
we have to report as long ad , except for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment no more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the in@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had changed . however , a passage was kn@@ itted among other things , which the partners were armed for reconciliation .
opinions about the changes are apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an occasion for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law does not apply as a great return . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ ves . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ er Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ arch sigh@@ ted ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper ra@@ ged attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the information Minister , &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the om@@ an authorities closed an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the ed@@ itors of the newspaper , continues to serve in prison , where he served a year sentence .
two other ed@@ itors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and presented in court later again .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ id , who came to power after completing his father , Sa@@ id i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a state of state .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the reign of Sult@@ ans is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , in particular , public liber@@ ties , including public freedom , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , to be sh@@ y and incar@@ cer@@ ely .
the authorities det@@ oxi@@ fy peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights system@@ atically and legitim@@ ate citizens , also activ@@ ist their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions in both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure , and the detention of three of its ed@@ itors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which since its foundation in 2007 , has been reported about corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , took an article with the title of &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of Justice &quot; which was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , and the mixture of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise the judgment in a possession of a possession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial Committee , was invited by the ISS in front of the Special Department and on his arrival from security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy CEO of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had directed his editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the newspaper was shut down at in@@ definitely , after the information Minister had given the instruction that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Dig@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced both among others because of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public audience and s@@ lander for a s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es of $ 3,000 in each case ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year vocational prohibition was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 giant ( 2600 US dollars ) , after the use of &quot; an information network for spreading material which could represent an risk of public order &quot; was found guilty .
for Al @-@ demol@@ i , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ nia Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Dig@@ i , the Court of Appe@@ al , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ al also took up the decision of the information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n re@@ bound again , the newspaper looks like attacks before attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued a statement by the closure of &quot; Al@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister was personally signed a further order in which the closure of &quot; Al@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended by three additional months , with which the Minister decided again for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper again .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was injured in Oman .
for further injuries , for example , include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country , its operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ nia authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional exemp@@ t ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman ensure their legal human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ tal@@ i@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans , can exercise .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) , in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries , to gather peace@@ fully , and offers protection for them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , figure is made with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the demand of medi@@ cally active medical research there are two reasons : to place a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have widespread impact than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa , and lack investments for research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , the research that is carried out by African scientists themselves will only be eligible for the development of own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it is director of the Centre for the research of infectious disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ection Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
it grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself educated in the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ pled health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media on this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in this way , I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion of the important current knowledge of knowledge in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we &apos;re just about solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient , rather than being gre@@ ed .
the solutions that we get , are often not use@@ able in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find a suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are being supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who return or go back here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards of developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it lasts months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were to be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are need of special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries , based on your experience ?
RW @-@ RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do and the stress access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be made available only for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : such as &quot; open source &quot; seed producers make the world &apos;s worldwide food production
this post of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a@@ .com website , a magazine which is reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been supporting let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ oms , the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA and astron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , M@@ ort@@ on &apos;s work has been set only by its own accident and question how many salad leaves can get boundaries .
but at the beginning of 2000 he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as w@@ att@@ ability to diseases , a special red or green or mol@@ ded leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been signed up to more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons varieties . due to this trends , plant @-@ protective equipment and experts provide food safety around the future of food production .
as a passi@@ on@@ ately representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , M@@ orton still doesn &apos;t need salad , however , however , it is longer necessary to keep his work more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I have a rock in a rock , in order to get out of a rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents are too far too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can toler@@ ate any more of a new sal@@ ads because all the features are patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tried to encourage the characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful not to use any material which is protected as intellectual property .
it is also joined by a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Zü@@ ges ) .
astron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety Out@@ ther in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there is tested whether plants can be grown up in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds more such as if the movement originate from the IT @-@ area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which offers alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plants and species are not being protected as intellectual property , and can be used for plant breeding facilities .
as part of the initiative , just as Oss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ e@@ ders can undertake to use that other of them are bred seeds free from them .
this does not mean that they don &apos;t continue to make business with their seed and we can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only others who want to buy their seed , it is not necessary to apply it - two aspects which are forbidden through many vegetable oils or mandatory .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
d@@ amped outlook
for the retired professor of Wisconsin University of Wisconsin and Oss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to encourage new plants , both for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays an important role in larger con@@ forms such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the dietary system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter , not or just a little by ref@@ using seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg has emphas@@ ised that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gen@@ etically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gen@@ etically modified or not , for example , we need control of ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who wants to purchase good , locally , sustainable and sustain@@ ably productive vegetables , should also know that the fashion is bred , such as this vegetables is bred .
food sovereignty without seed stability is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commits itself to make other seed still available free of charge . in contrast to this , their benefits are to be patented in contrast , seeds and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supp@@ orter argue that the future of food supply may be endangered due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights to plant material that is thus un@@ restricted , un@@ negli@@ gible .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in her doctorate thesis with gen@@ eric Vari@@ ation at kar@@ at and their availability . it was found that about one @-@ third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , which means it either can not be used for plant@@ ing machines either .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as a let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ible
plants are so far@@ med that they are targeted specifically for targeted features - of such that their taste or colour improves up to such as they th@@ ri@@ ve and thre@@ ats such as p@@ ests and diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders decreases by more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary to be more than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ ct will recognize that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . together with four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agri@@ cultural Ministry of the United States , the company set up for the preservation of genetic diversity .
it is , however , the view that intellectual property is restri@@ ct other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant variations . &quot; a patent is basically taken up a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired .
often these instructions help others with another method to come to the same result .
such protection measures not so innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
M@@ orton sees it otherwise : 20 years to wait until a patent service , bring it no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long on it , to plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant @-@ makers have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aires inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers to work .
that is what drives us , and it will be impossible to use it if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton reveals Himself to patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features for themselves .
they form the plants themselves and as bre@@ eder , we have no idea to do it as plants that do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plant Engineering , in the U.S. State Oregon and Oss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; he who chast@@ ened a variety , also stimul@@ ates his own values in it .
who believes in industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation will need to be her@@ b@@ icide needed to expand its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is ge@@ ared . &quot;
while some medium sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , also without patents - either reject them or keep it for too expensive and therefore not be worthwhile or both of the case .
the independent plant of plant Frank M@@ orton is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo of Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would become more innovative by avoi@@ ding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something stronger than companies that are patented .
I need new stuff to my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is 20 years ahead of the competition with which it makes my opinion very much easy . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; discipline , but the concept is spread quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program works in the centre with farmers and helps them to encourage new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports you to get to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the Organisation Agre@@ e is an &quot; open source &quot; License , which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i commitment to bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , absent for the Oss@@ i commitment to be one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive executive of the European Union , the European Commission declares that the conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it talks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which holds patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to put this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , governmental organizations and representatives from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for patent rights .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently distribut@@ ing a worldwide alliance to open source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year &apos;s official start .
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to seeds and biodiversity , to publish a seed map project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , announced the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , and others - a report . it represents the possibility that farmers must be able to share it and improve the seed policy to carry out a stable supply with food funds .
in the report it will also emphas@@ ised the importance of a varied , local power supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by from Oss@@ i hopes to see it soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motion for regional and ecological foods have especially been respected , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clari@@ fy the people that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities un@@ lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents the human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it was criti@@ ci@@ zed by the Egyptian authorities for this step , promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Legal Network for Human Rights Information is bt@@ ful despite this attack and the constitution through the authorities , which had to pursue these objectives as it was not so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI had been able to overcome these targets to overcome the blo@@ cking and do not exist . we insi@@ sted on it to fulfil our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked off the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / . co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI there is also no access to Egypt in the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights studies Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of Columbus and articles that he has not written in Egypt not accessible web pages and media .
now , the blog , which he set up in order to prevent the Zen@@ en@@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , who is home to Zi@@ adas blog in Germany , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and put a video on how the police executed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the blo@@ cking by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to block is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blo@@ cking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is it for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , an in@@ charging of the national Security Council , the blo@@ cking blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Summit of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian officials from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , amongst others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blo@@ cking of providers by using Internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private sur@@ fers , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blo@@ cking of websites , which offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began .
such practice indicates that the government &apos;s intention to block content , and to filter content , could have access to the Egyptian user .
in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the Zen@@ sur@@ geri@@ es are taken behind the closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no cause with the help of which they can proceed against this action .
now question : how far is the Egyptian government is willing to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the citizens do dispute .

day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with d@@ amping head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ age images .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es smo@@ oth@@ ed pharmacy led by military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air forces to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the violence in 2017 reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called to interven@@ e the United Nations .
reports such as these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers find a local newspaper .
in this way , published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the editorial article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to establish a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the news :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ab@@ normal@@ ities , etc . everything that happens in Rio will be published in the section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country which does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 fields , which are controlled by the criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if he is distor@@ ted , can also be used to mis@@ use the police , who only shoot and ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and their partners .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than they are used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist , Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , ar@@ gued the violence as &quot; war &quot; . in their opinion , this is a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and it could make it difficult to comp@@ ute responsibility for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negle@@ ct of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro &apos;s state is greater than just his capital .

in Rio de Janeiro as &quot; as &quot; the violent most violent place in Brazil , &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
no one of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we watch the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes .
especially the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , has emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeated since years of security policy .
among these safety policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by means of a massive police force to conquer a Fav@@ ela and a unity permanently .
initially , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . since a couple of years , the U@@ PP led the U@@ PP after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor churches which was to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the power in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to the legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state , means and ways to use the typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape , and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ateral Damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wander@@ ing balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
a week , it is now that the police re@@ marked the mountain by the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho bridge , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the middle of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ bit@@ er died due to sho@@ cks that had fired police from a helicopter .

in order to stay alive : besieged Syrians to plant fung@@ i ,
screenshot from the Advert@@ ising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime compared to lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Pa@@ x and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
especially strongly affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on the basis of investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacres committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by rebel zones outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants of local residents and control points have been consumed by tunnel and control points .
through the long@@ lasting block@@ ade are traditional food items such as meat un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a consequence , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics has taught the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call itself G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near here and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
these mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria , and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food is an attractive food source for many people of the besieged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the project of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years , this project has been pro@@ ving and pressed his relief , that it is now more and more &quot; to gain popularity . &quot;

Portuguese claim justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that settled in the north of Portugal in the north .
two and forty @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government had called solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ fighters who spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , there are approximately 500,000 acres of forest burned in Portugal - an area covered by the area of Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the serious situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the Civil Protection was not able to enter the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of the farmer explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not exist nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open roads which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , the appro@@ vals appro@@ ves in eco @-@ law with a high level of fire .
a wide suggest@@ ion to the Wal@@ loon form , which led the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was filed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction of the case , if the applicant had an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val was further on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made it atten@@ tive that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees of slightly com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble wood , seemed to spread as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the walls of this species .
it was added to these problems that the website of the civil society of Portugal on 15th and 16th of October , as inhabitants of searching , seeking to contact members , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used his own civilian protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was decisive at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who pursued the fires , the website counted more than half a million .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Y@@ as@@ in in Venice .

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out in groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati sat , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan , for the last time with his family .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say so , she knew that she would not see her son very long anymore - maybe even more .
the boy should break the boy in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the locks .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b e @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara had suddenly felt swept away .
the Taliban on their hatred for the Haz@@ ara conf@@ essed are ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ott@@ age . the work was hard and made it ill .
then he took what was left of its low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was found in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar , heavier than he himself , to earn his life .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remin@@ ded in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open window , so that we do not have any service at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran , and was ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church , which distributed twice a day of food to help@@ needs .
it is true that Italy is a second chance to apply an asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high @-@ desire quot@@ as . however , it is true that conditions to apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c are cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
the human rights organisation of the Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the great majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special trial centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center when they officially took a request for asylum - what to register after the registration of the request for months .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation to either go to the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street .
thus also A@@ shar@@ k went .
but his barren hab@@ it helped A@@ shar@@ k to release himself from these conditions .
after several years he had made various works in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings into the founding of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so well that he opened a second hostel and a quick open hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now on the theme of the Docum@@ entary Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was launched for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
a lot of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of the Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including sl@@ ings , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ di had the idea to its restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the men@@ ue of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
Afghan entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria of Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian food industry and retail sales , and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my land , and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily , when I know he suff@@ ers from my people .
I am a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and you need to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also describes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atory techniques . &quot; in this way , they can sell their appo@@ intments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ k made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian Parliament will review a draft law , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users have to be able to take advantage of the social networks within six months after the successful legislative resolution on the website of the authority , stating its complete name and record number .
he who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the En@@ counter @-@ payment of a penalty .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by sixty members of parliament , is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there .
another dep@@ uties gave a legislative proposal to be introduced in the har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high civil servants .
under the Egyptian Law , the pre@@ valence of the President and state facilities are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal would be such a matter with prison and fin@@ es , then right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean by up to three years &apos; imprisonment for the convicted .
furthermore , this would have a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a prominent example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested for the same incident , four years in jail at a trial date .
recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th May , because the prison line had failed , according to human rights groups , to bring the def@@ endant from the prison quarters in the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ hur@@ ri@@ cane threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are lon@@ ged , with others , arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary free of charge . they were indicted for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also were arrested for the first time in the previous year , from 25 years to 5 years .
the tun@@ ic activ@@ ist passes through per@@ ver@@ ted documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia suffered mainly to a transparent action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan was expressly endor@@ sed by the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption , accused am@@ nesty am@@ nesty decre@@ ed if all these were un@@ justified funds .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published a light on how to look out the pre@@ si@@ zing plans to support the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources by speci@@ fying Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release , journalists fully sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nonetheless he entered the district court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force social media to submit their identification ?
according to the new rules of information from the national council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write messages in social media or share .
in the regulations it is indicated that registration will be required by full name .
analysts believe that this will be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities shall apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens suggested to social media , these regulations sel@@ ects only sel@@ ec@@ tively to protect people journ@@ alism and independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?

may the state Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship disp@@ leased Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app , We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ al@@ gi@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , the &quot; organizer of the information pro@@ lifer@@ ation was to register at the state government .
this designation is part of an Act of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is a list of online services that can organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law allows the government to communicate and forced them on request for removal of users .
one of these websites are sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
