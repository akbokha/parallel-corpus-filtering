<seg id="1">Although I had visited the U.S. for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American music was read and operated by American writers, American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a good profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I saw 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which was covered by Julia Roberts as Jura student, who had the Supreme Court of an oil painting with judges who were over his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it as if that is the absolute truth, forget anything else, this is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had just increased my admiration for the US only.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you are always something that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very nice love letter on its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the auspices and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he needs to face with his face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague it express and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroe and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements, and tuned to him in droves to him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number one ever reached from the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigs person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his voters with the people who I had met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalism "program, gave people from all over the world, a deeply stitious person with whom I maintained about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps also did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the Phoenix Suns at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, that fights for life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still they still fit to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me and grace to me and my colleagues, to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who are represented by them empered my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump became its way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate of the Republican candidate, they bring to me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people have tuned to Trump, because they were either distributed to his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to designate the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an unability to understand the ones that act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most know are to have voted for trump, because they would like control of control of a country that they had disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with attention to those who looks like he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (n.d.).: as much as "Rejection of the White Against all other Ethnic"; the word game which is so much means that the big Van Jones called it, exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America welcomes every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country is elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan's son, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise to say: to Hell with versatility, religion freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruins, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of men.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "" "Mr Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims got a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" there's a lot of roar.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a strong and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "thank God," thank you, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was recalled.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country where his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no more space in this new Americas.</seg>
<seg id="62">And mine heart breaks me.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery of the stars: these Latin American children can not destroy their love to music by garbage.</seg>
<seg id="67">The "recycling tool Orchestra" from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero church in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic town Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby beautiful Colombian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has now been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has its musical instruments, has an opportunity to overcome them in the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is situated in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and bonds.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this was changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had ever offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments across the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI says:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust of the streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for the day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - based on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with prepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the case into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times recalls Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musicians of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, the kids did not know music, and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio, which he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on the instruments of recovered material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws up the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest, like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beauty.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from garl to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has played its music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork will be able to fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices on the common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time it was known that this ship had already been run in Liberia's waters, before it was seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore raised to us, a bit inclined, to be called a law of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and the Seychelles, rapidly increased against the ship. they refused to divide one of their harbours and refused to divide it a fishery base.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Ursuddenly, the Premier is surrounded by countries that are just refused," reminds us of Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and then followed.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the region of the region: it wasn't able to catch him to catch fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for a plundering of fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices cross and protect resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, who then distributed the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are equalled and collaborate together. they exchange information and are each other for illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charging Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated: what is caught, is hidden so due to it extremely difficult to expand. this is illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberation of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species shall be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing could be disabled through bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions now occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this case, the individual countries can exchange groups, such as lists, suspect activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very thoughtful, if it move on the open sea, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in banned areas - such that the ships suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fisheglizence, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing industry can refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships can not be sold their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay a number from penalties, as in the case of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"it then goes for significant financial losses for the owners, which means illegal fish catch is not worthwhile anymore.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a division company that focuses on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win $20 million to lost revenues, which are losing eight members of the HISH company HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing in East Africa, due to the region's commercial fishing catch from around the world. under these, they also have illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices amongst others are number as the sails under false flag, fake license papers, indication of imagery, fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"you can take advantage of the missing international cooperation, and make the weaknesses of a non-bridge organized control system," says Long. "previously, a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You are not going to run my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "". "" "" "and this alloy try to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved more than 30 investigations of the ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to divide the fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found whispering ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">In addition to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can distribute information on illegal fishing across large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizational crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to be digest ships even more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always refined, is also helping to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chattalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be rendered by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information panels. FISH-i will help you to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">However, FISH-i's team of african actually affect influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each traceable shippers worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to get a better picture of that, to get a better picture of that, what does it simply does," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run in which a global system allows persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only feeling of criminals, but also quenching them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were used to fuse without license and had barely reckoned with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have a 33% increase in fisheries, as well as fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">When FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board locks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is very strong that we now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object." in Westafrican disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are also six countries joined the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "with safety, the goal is to bring more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was traveling with false flag. and not only the ship was used without any license and were forbidden to use them.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" take a strong sign for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time, evidence that such a special, collaborative working methods for the protection of the oceans is actually works throughout the world's sea.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans responded, in whose sight the negotiations led to the political and economic crisis of the country in the void, as they were assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the backorder of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land Barinas, in the regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located north-east federal aat Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorated continuously, what makes it in everyday life of Venezuelans through an acute shortage of food and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition were seen in the presence of Presidents NicolÃ¡s Maduro's favour on a fundamental change; however, however, it was blocked for a re-election of the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the context of the government's context in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated at 500%) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to restore the country to restore its institutional structures and to join a new government.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, on August 23, 2016 on DÃ­a, DÃ­a, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano spoke in the context of the large La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the BÃ¼rde to bear the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations at La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a magicent.</seg>
<seg id="207">One child under 15 is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not recognize that my father was a thief, the following, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriechs. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, which is charged due to kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos Son, a man who knew the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and he said before a court in front of his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent over his child, and how this child chose a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father had begun to take me to the military base, I often walked with us into the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me to identify my friend on it.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought I was fine. for so my father loved me.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, coolbox - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything from it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small in a blanket, and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects have been shut down and held me with an outpost.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There they are going to practice the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="238">I was lying in, and saw a song that were tortured to man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field of field and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable. the other end was fixed at the body of the person who had just been tiled there.</seg>

<seg id="252">Near the entrance, they keep silence on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos from Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes, a village of Kyotos, who was also aware of the local time newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Khimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is a insult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto's prefecture were repeated for the translation error. furthermore, she stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked by the translator and that the translation has not been tested on its correctness before it was released.</seg>

<seg id="359">"we are sorry that elderly people had offended because of inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>

<seg id="362">In the Kyoto's prefecture, for example, 1.941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overplace you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting point of understanding and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active body of the target language - something that is with native languages of the case. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="379">So, a French native speaker should translate the French French name - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could translations into English. this may learn the lack of understanding for the survival, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign workers, make translations made intermending. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machinable translations are also common - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distorted and traverse sets that are caused by mechanical transmissions are showing that this technology can replace no human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English forums in Japan, among them also the oblique imprints that are often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistical reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users to Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation defects may be acceptable for acceptable or at least harmless than jewelry or at least harmless. but of big companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, one can expect a careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ eldaoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-perched channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV camera cameraman Elvis Flores, who had passed the protests in Caracas, was put into custody.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money transfer their minor son or her minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what does not mention, is that the children do not have innumerable days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay thanks to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered testimony of testimony that denounced and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the Criaditas guarantees to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double taller," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">As one is on the other hand, the family who make their daughter in the faith that she would improve their training, improve their position in society and can make something out of itself, "to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which justifies the girl with itself and justifies their exploitation with faith, that they should give someone a chance, who wouldn't have any training, and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in their house at VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck a stick with a stick to MarÃ­n, until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last puncture in the life of the young girl.</seg>

<seg id="465">The more they were finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time also was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says that she never had to starve, but got even non-limited food. "I was able to bring me more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the manager, a ehemaliative military and sympathizers of Partido Liberal, a liberal party responsible for the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In addition to some evenings, the owner of the house Alvarenga forced to stand in addition to him and to read the article in opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In this process he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the regime of the dictator.</seg>

<seg id="473">They feared their Lord, that they would lose the education that they had made, they would lose.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was, however, completely clear that they had paid for everything that had paid them from them, with hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated in the school. "a thing that is almost never spoken, are bbing and the chicans to whom Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they realize that somebody, who has no parents, is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not leave anyone home at home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, edited by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently approved a draft law to "the regulations concerning the use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is assumed by Parliament, users will have to register conventions and users of social media in Egypt, in order to utilize social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would then be set up, which was commissioned to share citizens and citizens with permission to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users would have to register the user's website with their right name and number of numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is going to do this, this could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six pages, is defined in local media including Youm7 and Egypt, defined social media as "jedwede application which is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video concepts and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set when it is assumed that the design is not aware that the draft authorities may not be able to register the user as they do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is capable of ensuring the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament and promoter of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and users from the telecommunications Ministry signed a user name and a password "to come through the firewall to block the Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to establish a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary for Egyptian women and Egyptians to enter information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not so far known that such plans are made.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts in front of the site are sceptical regarding the technical machinability of the court.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technical Research (") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" Egyptian Initiative for personal rights, ") told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubting greatly in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding the things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion they are doing so that just as they forcibly control their physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, this means that they may request a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens, who do not apply for permission or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically quite realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of Parliament and the Constitutional Committees before it goes into the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximised and ensured that no further deviating migration is present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative template against Cyber crime crime against Cyber Crime, in which a life-long sentence was found guilty of being found guilty of the "public order" and "protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard, the only remaining predators in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the trathrive of the ecosystem, also depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure pleasure.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11, 2011, and still is the region with its reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the Kahou Shimpo's daily newspaper Kahou Shimpo had been documented in order to reconstruct the life of those who had been hit by the "three-catastrophe" of March 2011. a great earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear accident at Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is situated in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a comprehensive prefectures in Japan, both experiencing the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring areas of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to be forced, because the tsunami had vanished the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even with this, the Fukushima prefecture had to have an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahou Shimpo is exhibiting in local view which has been reached six years after that, to rebuild the life of the location based.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstructions as well as the survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (such as), savorai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The largest success among the three prefectures was posted Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is equipped with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by the evacuation of accommodation (such a), kasetsu juutaku, to settle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the three-catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in notices, whereas Miyagi was successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuation of the evacuation in accommodation and were transferred to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of the work and daily life in the three affected prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by evil, their doors opened up until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction was far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fish farms in Iwate and Miyagi is now back in operation, only 30 percent of fish farms have been resumed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved into the three prefectures of agricultural land large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of cultivated farmland of Fukushima, lie in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has largely recovered again, but Fukushima happened far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the evil. Fukushima, however, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete image, the newspaper introduced numerous evidence among the native population and under the evacuated population. they asked them about the status of the resurgence and also how their Recommended has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures taken, measures taken in order to be prepared in future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 52.7 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes health prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had been evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has addressed their attention to the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophes caused, atomic accident, to the Japan ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 people from Fukushima were moved to almost 63 000 people outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, to be transferred to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes areas, most of the evacuees are still felt older than 50 years old. they have to be able to restore the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. this involves construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in the year 2020.</seg>

<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look forward to this global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal topics that are often less attention in coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, which are reminded at a moment in which they have felt very strongly with someone over language and country boundaries.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull of brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him to this Saturday and put it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, who quickly spread themselves in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures is also recognizable in the pictures, the face of police officers, identified with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian federal state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia and his drummer on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would rent a demonstrators and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be visible six months in television and the whole suppression would thus be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page, "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, distributed video in the network where you see how Mateus will attack by the police officer and several plumbing shortly after it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed in a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown clip one can see the attack on Mateus down from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family who lives in another federal state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilians Reais (approximately 2.700 euros) to cover some of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in GoiÃ¢nia, while he is located in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political power. here, the activist Guilherme Irish presidency joined his father, because he has been sabotage the military police with a throttage. and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen, who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police disclosure</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to be linked to demonstrators in the past Friday.</seg>

<seg id="617">"" "the deputies Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against protesters." ""</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media is demonstrating the street protests by focusing on another, unexpected protagonists: a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically to create a broken glass windows in order to elaborate on a photo of the cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a set-on-down bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no sizeable journalistic reason, more than a broken window of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognized, if one is strictly damaged against any form of atomic facts.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" gets an absurd, undisproportionate significance, and the typical violence of the military police are concealed by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confront course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Escape of the inductive villages of Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories included in Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Popular Church of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, is located in the western Cuba's western province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill - known for the fact that there is no significant suck suernity on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were lapped in the sugar-tube factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">In the region, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost its plants and remained in its plants until only the report of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 employees had to be reinventing himself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuted daily to the factories, that were still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldata veteran, who stands every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar-tube industry do not stick its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it works in the east of the sugar-tube factories, which are back into operation after a long time of active time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly belongs to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar-tube industry has already the plagues, the fall of Socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffles, the bad administrative decision and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, produced less than 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country for some decades, but the poor yields already exist no more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban ricane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already looked better.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar-tube industry was a economical cost: the 155 sugar-tube factories were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive, they were inportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to these measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the debt crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar prize rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar amounts between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">When the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar-export would generate about $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro came into force during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, there came a total of 98 sugar tubes factories, more than 65 million persons received their full salaries for continuing education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word he is repeated in most, "Scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed are the same opinion: not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place will be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first shot year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">The official documents were officially adopted, which would only be removed concerning the parts that would be removed, the addsat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulja Rosales del Toro, only the Minister was able to authorize any violation.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was transferred and the letters were increasingly being more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-set factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the yet in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved with his will at the standstill of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part which he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important workplace was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for working conditions and services that were included in the congregations in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar tubes factory was closed, or even better than they began to take them away, they also listened to asphale, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission from N 'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they are doing so with Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan tour, mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers, to offer youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Northern Quebec with ten cree communities, and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will thus be one that the young participants in talks about such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever they enter in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the British Columbia's Canadian province and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak's first nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway from tears," a road section of Westkanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not yet resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the young people do not rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapooostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help of Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who awarded them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookside of N 'we Jinan stands the Strophe is available in the heading, as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on the earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you'll get to our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will lift us one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and precedes them as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what is determined by the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentartboard the reader and supporter of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also provides a contribution and adds the Strophe in Silicon (which is also published on his blog and re-published here):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can view almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (the manner), "Plastic models of dishes") will be presented by any food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">An entire industry is devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a great number of these small companies that produce those plagued dishes, which the German filmmakers Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they don't want them even more. a new trend, however, is transformed today in conspicuous mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naval Matome, the Blogger itinii set a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic dishes made mobile phone tapes to be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foodstuffs were changed to kitschy collection objects, such as in this case, coolant recipes:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of Shokud coolers for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essence is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular trip with sea-fruits) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">We have found a good use for this triangular bowl (lol) for this triangular bowl.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part in the Tokyo station in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to see like an apple, with a guy for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach into coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers will allow you to restore your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon are used, a popular Topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can't make my mobile with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think, I'm probably the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetite form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting of ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also camper balls (onigiri), Earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itevi's Naval Matome blog post. or follow the Twitter of the Hashtag # otherwise the same.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of the trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, dedicated to the Beliee of the Restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking in Mexico, Vermists and Getting regularly occur only in statistics, but these are not reflected at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings together.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapman GuzmÃ¡n, the boss of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">A day after a violent incident, no one looks at the sadness or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trade") to give up a voice and stories of people who killed in the battle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">We can not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and Sensory journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass a newspaper on newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or documents of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one who is dazzle or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal to or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continued to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is big. and it's not normal that people listen via the "heroism" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear them, so that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories too naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatarness of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students have been justified in a neighboring village that they were "delayed."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they will be spared from their tragedies, if they don't stir and still remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the "Four Months Reception in the Main Town:" like a family with threats, it describes how the armed crime month was weaned from her business until they had destroyed the business only, but also her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and about how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">Pain is never passes away, the grief remains high if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">They completed their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others be arrested, for they do not know when they lead you, or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in these terrible days, whether weeping would detaint my deeper feelings but the answers is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of authority created by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he asks questions on how: who cares about the child of a little woman and a man who was murdered in the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like the other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphans and he tells that he had to take himself as one egg, boiled potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father saw that the armed men had been shot by armed men.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a result of the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of Morde according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor's Office had 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Mora per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that have organised the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of new headlines. this project reminds us of those who we do not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" in 2015, the data journalism project Narcoco "has founded the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking in which the country has been tormented in the last four decades in a prudent manner.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to raise a rumor to unmask a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something is dipped for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or unreal, tend to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it was used to serve as mischief, tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false vision of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny us the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, questions about our desire to see images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, and exploded and exploded. 230 people came to live.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, the second largest country has been neglected and destroyed. the streets in the region became too dangerous plums full of slaughter, the difficult to ride.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the fuel tank fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">The representatives will be described by a fire ball that covered the dozens of houses including a cinemas in the vicinity, which was full of people who watch the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses contaminated and carded dead bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unmistakable.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.multiple photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body, which are lined up on the ground while persons can look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was refreshed for several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, although it was not to be attributed to the relationship of the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the unlegenic towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies in streets and bÃ¼sch.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "the numbers could not be confirmed." no one remained back to count corpses, "" "" said one person on Human Rights Watch. "" "</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only based on satellite images the following time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army site in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram, country to win (examples from the year 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as proof as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false explications; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image was taken to be a testament to the massacre.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The painting from Sange appeared in conjunction with the fatal persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and some dead, some by firing.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, postings like the following on which these descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from a Saudi secret news page that was falsified in 2012, the President Mykonmars Than. in addition, they had used the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from the DR Congo to describe these information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original fee, which was accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, the AFP, as their source, had also attributed to Than His statement, but had not made the picture of the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false data</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false couplings are going back to the years 2011 and 2012, and actually come from everywhere around the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the aid of an "inverted picture-search" you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found a look at 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixed masch private page, platforms, social media and shared scientific publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have any wrong reports redirected, others have tried to delared the forfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We also borders examples of the use of the use and associated with the respective countries, based on what page they were published. in this way, we want to illustrate the coverage than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of misuse are from the below listed countries (which are linked together in some cases).</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (radiotherapy) which draw this post. the first frame is focusing on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions on silence, in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims, or for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second fresher uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion does not want to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if reading this pictures may not be able to give this pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are eighty people who are unintended to share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugary these sentiment of false and folding information that actual abominations have been wrong and tasted that the real estate of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of non-violent images have already been debited in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the back of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures and viewers desperate and receive them the ability to empathy receive empathy (such as the study that sought to work as non-violent media on it).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some non-violent representations in the news media, the fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologous experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you'll have to think about the situation in which a picture must suggests something, which is actually replaced by context or on completely misused type.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (ex. untranslated) endeavours to offer a selection of words from around the world, which are difficult or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in each language: press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslated words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudi Arabia) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brakes).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard-nesting in any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not satisfy for which a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguinguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the VAT of Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Entry to do your parents in recognition of how to do you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The Bequintality or sloth which you feel after you have felt in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deflees other cultures, reveal other ideas and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more of these "untranslated" words, and show how differently, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner the "Treasure Languages" which are very appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to download their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to enter here and in spite of a language barrier with someone else?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as little languages cannot be passed on to the children born.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the Project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities - safe environments where people don't need to be forgotten to belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" listen often, "" "" to understand these events instead, "" "" listen to these events instead, "" "" to feel "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, history counter will initially present their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional history counter, their dedication will lead them and their representation is that the audiences are transferred on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the history number Rassidatou Conate is also the opportunity to explain to their country typical customs of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the bunnies and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the meaning of his findings, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience which does not understand your language?" with a broad grinsen he divides his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can be able to contact TLS in order to organize their own history courses.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amount to 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started in the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda." (sidefront for the neural examination of the debts) and the Okomenian Church of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The publication of the rejection of the debt of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros calls for the politicians, benchker and government authorities that are responsible for the debts of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We require a financial examination and a cable committee without personal interests to the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions such compensation, which is agiert.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will press and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay a blame which is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ros requires a wide restructure of government infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk of being rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian Web developer Baska Khartabil, also known as Baska Safadi, has been missed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, he continued his supporters and to remind the campaign for his freedom and carried out the contributions that he has made an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, which will be held annually to the digital culture that will be held in Berlin, dedicated an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist who produced in France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book-called 'Book sprints' ready books within three to five days, read out of the book Cost of Ma: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of sections which deal with the free culture in the presence of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction there is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for freedom of freedom and what the real costs are connected to those that are connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, researchers, scientists and authors, who participated in the movements of freedom of freedom, have worked on page in order to look over the fog that use our newsletters and create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Baska Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of colleague gives his friends and his family a voice that would turn on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us start to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web company for open source and digital activity has been in jail by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, author and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Baska had taken on the basis of a" strictly geheim "designated command of the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted on November 12, 2015 by people who used themselves as an insider of the Assad government and they were aware of a alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand the Internet and know knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technical ologist and currently overrun the ladder by New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">In fact, no one of Basle's cultural prototypes was predictive as the work that he started working with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the displacement of numerous civilizations and merge here the Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesly traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would be everything to it, this architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip train into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time clause which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, the base of this project could not yet be shut down yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with them, of dreams and Bashan taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English at, even when he was already detained in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English good, write and talk.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught others who taught English to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other inmates, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without the fact that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a rehearsal which she wrote in January 2012 until 2015, when he was detained in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together with the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She took the lyrics to him when he visited him, and he translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>

<seg id="1236">If your eyes are farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will send another piece of my soul with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And over your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you still are in the cage of the monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">The story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the regime Bashar al-Assads, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or destroyed under violence by the regime were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community demands the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We now repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption and sentenced him back to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded to a corruption of corruption, in which a governmental member, after the half of his sentence, returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is a Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was taken of public joints at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was Chief Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately called for his re-setting in the company, what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In compliance with a position of the General Attorney General of the Republic, which governs the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza to get back his old position, as the company was no disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short of CIP), is an local institution dedicated to public transparency, denounced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to address the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Poses a return in the fight against corruption, and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware that the company should lead a disciplinary procedure against the infringement of the disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company kept silent, however, indicates no appropriate legal steps for application of corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, rejects this behavior also and considers the case as "conflicting.":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser to be convicted and sentenced to half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could withstand lectures and motivating words, he could consult and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is competent, he has interpreted to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradict!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not sow Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he didn't believe him, that they would be rewarded to someone in such a way that the state has already declared massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state in order to be an inexhaustible monetary source and state itself, this man has become tired, who was unloaded and finally condemned to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to recall that a thief has heard in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as sharp, cutting and - in the same time - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, as he confirmed that "an ambitious human being is to be able to sell, even the country for its ambitions, its own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes itself, my experience shows that it is not the same. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also canceled:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and he was 10 years old and was released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company put him down under contract for which he retreason, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - extraordinates. (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information on Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their postings from the net, because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or used as adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar," or the extent that (in Burmese scripture) as part of an initiative to enter the widespread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the past few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely abdictive calonnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists than Hassi against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the endeavour, to fight against it in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of senseless content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism in conjunction with racism, but the word at itself is not rendered automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts purposes of his use, were licensed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmired words with different meanings that have the same letter sequence such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written down to Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(spreadiness),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' Calarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobison Aung Kaat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was still erased today, because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends of spirituous species, whether they were wanting to relieve his back pain, as he did a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase" "" "Healing" "" "(ku) +" "" "(ku) + the questioner (la) is quite different, but the context is quite different, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different responses to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hath is the opinion that it is likely to reduce the pronunciation of radical nationalists, but he also emphasised that Facebook has been analytical to spread out demons in the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on fachook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, is carefully analyzed by the post by checking it carefully, inspect the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spreadings).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three nationalists are spread the city of Hassar, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion may send a strong signal to all, it may spread the efficiency of this strategy not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a catch- and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are easy to start to express a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaat Myat described as Facebook to extinguish his post, when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I was attentive to these new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my facebook friends that the Word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post of Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden by liken, post and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the Post's Post has not ratified the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of people removed from people who have no negative intentions or who are simply trying to show their opinions against the Al-radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with Hassler:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassi is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook is supposed to do more than before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet Community has to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a well-going intent, racism in Burma began to reduce racism in Burma, but this does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be used only to bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems that if they have begun without local context or technical support, and have forbidden such words such as "chair" or "pesencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out they did not try, they tried not to rectify the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would benefit to them a major revenue, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of lots of users under users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than take it seriously, users are thinking about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar's not in the context of Hassar to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-postcards, which have no badge, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmeric text reads "I want to sit in a chair and watch an ecurry and watch a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out, Facebook is the mail which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious foundations have been used to have social networks to expand their votes and their influence.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament has unanimously decided to provide a law which will offer this practice, so that the marriage age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage Act, some members had taken dualistic and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harryoshsad Maharaj, a group, the representatives of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not be blamed that the state could not enter the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened inspite of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Human Rights, the minors, every person under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 indicate that the proportion of children who had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the Statistical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 over 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavour to make the laws to the child before, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. without doubt, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not all are smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns, to say the critics of the child before, they should be damn't worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This species of religious opposition impacted for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime came down to whether the opposition was at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child before - despite the four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would do it to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave up a status update on Facebook, which I posted by Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the Children's House was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was enthusiastic, because the laws have been changed to the child before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was clothed in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has been used too much time and unnecessary words that has veiled the core of the cause, but do you know what? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that's almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson the opinion was, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentre-Thomas exceeded that the day was finally fulfilled:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Hervorrae News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Basic Law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who is affiliated to Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age at Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation for 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment of the Act was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives, 35 of them present in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were against were voted to vote for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The child before is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # the maririageander).</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have handed him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Danke to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">In the months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial stages, should the law be adopted, and he seems to be able to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law thought it was absolutely right when Maharaj was thinking against the law, most social media users wish to deal with the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell defeated:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Preferable satellite, if we, instead of keeping the discussion as general, in a way that we may agree to the state in our bedroom, that they may not protect the state that they may need to be misused by major, hard-filled men who are contrary to them, "would you be ready to carry out the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the standard, although there are laws, which are subject to them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The German-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, mutual agreement to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey is now going to become popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans of TV series fight against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technician Internet users are accustomed to use strapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been woven from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University find out regular blockings of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently being updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform put on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which makes itself not a complete line of censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is yet available in spite of a ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS published about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the lock of Wikipedia), we used everything to put snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can not reach the website www.wikipeziorg themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also proved that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to get the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikianzikloel.org, an open source project, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hoist similar mirrors on Wikipedia when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Conscii informed Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks: Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack on a different URL that is not the original. what one can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server runs on request for the correct Wikipedia page, so it's possible to see the content of Wikipedia even when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivating him to wear it with themselves and to try to do the situation.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, SOS, Nepals are trying to get to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland right next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which guide the attention to Nepals animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described his job on Facebook as it helps to help him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was looking forward to seeing me suddenly in Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was, and I immediately began to break pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sanctists a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepals in order to obtain global recognition for Nepals and wants to make the understanding of that wild animals don't like the fear of how they look like.</seg>

<seg id="1433">Also because of the darkness in the way, I suddenly appeared in the way, when suddenly the King of the Buaviks appeared, and immediately we will see and starved through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked for Environmental Protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and most often lived in a tent to do in Bardia National Park's recordings of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger eye and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of an Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with greatest care are to avoid the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomous person or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">Von Chomisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband and fear of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should get the norm to do this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to the Indian state of Others in the Indian state of Others, and had the villagers from her family and the villagers.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives cannot be mentioned in the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less authorization to fear if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune village, in Maharasttra, nine women, including health staff, as well as housewives, a unique club, were thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss the delicacy of the patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelp Badal, powered by the community video Volunteers and uses for the disassembly of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's heifer to the associations of HIV- and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells us how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion group, was accused of women who do not name their husbands at name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to decide for this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak according to the names of their husbands, an brilliance is a custom, and never asked them in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini stated:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this one, is considered a crafty, as wife without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done to this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband so far as never called by name, try to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband kept silent, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should name him by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage started Rohini her first discussion slub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, mainly girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoyed, lovingly, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they will not respect ourselves?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women are married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands about the lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharastra about the Brechen of a year-old tradition in which married women to speak the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise only to be tilted; another decided to leave the whole frustration with him and to leave his family by putting him out.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the morning, with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to have their husbands at home, to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas found her in his head: his wife was not able to stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it when dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Her mother in her mother in law was afraid, she was afraid, saying that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of one participant in was less understanding and the situation was taken in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practitioners, such as the Trail of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the interest of a red point when he would like it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not have stopped completely, but my, they are now in a better position to choose it, in some days, not to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion of discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing a trip at every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "says she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they held their own birth days with cakes for the first time in their lives. they danced and sang about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have worked on some things, for example, such as our identities of our husbands, never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things noisy, no matter how small it occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have maintained through the concept of honor and is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried away only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Most of them is OK, but some wanted a salutation-curta, a wide shirt of a pants, they have not been comforted.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes hanger that morally linked with the Saris and much more, shrougini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion group, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To question whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion, Rohini has confirmed that the things slowly come into rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then ceased to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them included, make it still, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say to the names of their husbands; only one or two women now bear at each time of Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion luverb know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the finds around more freedom of movement or the own clothes elections - at the end of a hard to navigate to the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will realize that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini declared:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people reports about what we are talking about what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: Netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) re-reactions of international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissidents Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made it recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published at a partnership agreement by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents of Liu Xiaobo has withdrawn its attention in international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state of state of the state) after having taken part in the draft of democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Lius case as "an internal matter." he told it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel prize laureates and his wife, poetess Liu Xia, to allow or permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others are far off the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has given some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner to the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June, to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu abroad for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brend refused to answer questions about Lifetus for release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Liu, although the Norwegian government told it that it was not able to do nothing with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement for the salmon to China, as exports were largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After having found the message, Liu was seriously sick, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to unconditional release, and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was not able to meet his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants to seek.</seg>
<seg id="1648">China's top diplomatic relations in the EU, Federica Mogherini, China called for the release of Lius to release in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we anticipate that China lifts up all the restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, they wish them, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad agreed that the Americans would like to be" "" "him," "" "that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in the event of his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message of the Chinese authorities not only release Liu, not only liu, but also his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy moved out to an unexpectedly answer to China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to interfere with immediate remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer a couple of follicans:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protecting and freedom such as travel irritation and access to the medical care of his choice, which they have to be used according to Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">In addition, the US-Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push it, Liu and his wife unconditional.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to release the Nobel prize laureates # LiuXiaobo unconditional, so that he may proceed in a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German Government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hoping that Liu will get all the medical support that he needs "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns, whether the vortex could be surrendered to Hamburg's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide an appropriate medical care to provide and give it the opportunity to reproduce himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP previously, that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital, and that it is not permitted to meet someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada requires China to release its international human rights obligations, including the freedom of expression, maintaining and the rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry asked China to release in a statement on 29 June, Liu from humanitarian grounds:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary actions have to be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he, regardless of where, his wife and his family will have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information available if France will take him out of the end.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landlands in Taiwan in China called on 27 June to release Liu and require a greater tolerance to those who want to use peaceful funds in order to challenge political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Party of the Democratic Party of China also called for China to allow the sick person in Taiwan, to treat himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in a statement on June 28 at Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith, that the initiatives he had taken care and for which he was strictly punished, had led to a harmonious, stable and prosperous whose China would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moving and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, signed for Democracy, Freedom, and Law of China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question is stupid, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference, during a meeting of the international branch of the State Chamber of the State of New York, the Minister decided that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underline that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "says the logic" "" "to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable land, we hear that we were not to be a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulcanonaire, it had a flight to flee before the responsibility, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanmuters were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in the face of which, he appeared to be insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, it has defended that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally between cities committed permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the centre of the theme, the good old bodies of the authorized makers indicate to be the dictory Democrats, because they have turned into their power to be better.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, the answers were given in the last week of Shanbrave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our codicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions cloaked he with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to understand his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take to clarify this point, provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By calling on the blog his comment, he pointed out to the critics that one should begin to read the entire copy of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shandic amalgam, according to that Singapore is a city and not country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" be considered a country, "explains why the elections in Singapore so unimportant, even if we are happy to look forward to and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He behaved Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore is not a country, "he obviously didn't know it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over shandic amalgam, as leader of a growing generation, making such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said, very well...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes this, correct and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam have committed an error, or was it a Freuddy Replacement?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally the country and the city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the governmental office, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of severe importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do not the Lonurer of her military service defend her, but only their city do not defend their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity certificate?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Based on the magazine Journey of a Decade to affirmation, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have many Lonurer to be offended...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city and island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear something like "the defense of the country in particular," etc., but that is not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather from the defense of the town.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices, Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is put forward to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am from Canada." "" "I come from Canada." "" "I have lived and again in Japan since 1994." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation where the conversation is taking place, it is considered polite, interested in his talk partners, to show personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, usually the default value is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadian boil may be kept inside of anger when they are kept for Americans, but does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that the Canadian is different from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>

<seg id="1768">First of all: as "nice" is to be referred to in fact, such as the scaling, gentle, but tragically significant figure Ned Flaners from "The Simpsons" (who owns one of their own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of humans such as Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing to which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be, is unobtrusive and interesting to earn and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want unnoticed in the background, from things that happen to pass around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and only to be the Canadian citizen.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One of Thailand's famous pop-band has released a musical video that the Junta parodiert who seized power in 2014 and restore the government in spite of their unspeakable civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (phage Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour explains a young man who tells it that his friend makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the musical video refers to the ongoing military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">In the last month, the Charlie Chaplin video, "The dictator," was blocked after a group of activist to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, inparticular how it keeps itself with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political themes, which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may be based on the drastic Section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gave the Commander in Chief of the host to be more important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "11. rule:" change your attitude, "refers to the notorious program for" inclusion in journalists "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are considered by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer decriminality, whose vage and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to betray activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the Army, supervised by the online content and accused persons accused of having assassinated the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1797">In the video it is shown even how people will be thrown into a black delivery wagon before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sitting in prison because they allegedly causes "confusion" in society and the use of internet are being threatened to penalties that they should leave the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, cross Europe or Latin America, some places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is guided by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals of corals and gold colored rings in teddy Bears shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on the pass.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, roasted walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance hall there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitianic immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people come into full bushings and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse any one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them also and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay, they massive them with a balm that exhausted the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghace) pods with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes," yes, he answers with a smile. "I feel really that it fits into her, as African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">It has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston in order to re-find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America, and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other pioneers of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route" "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his departure leader Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again." we will always be in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells us that their guests will send their often text messages when they are gone to grate them or report on their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They do not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end of JesÃºs Valenzuela leads to Jeshurela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenciela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that Bustickets will be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground at the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenciela explains that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells us. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years he lived in a raid on his work point out of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula is coming from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to send money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a well-known, has offered him the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, the travellers consulted their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother they cherished in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair fleets, who made her a clientele, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and Old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs and she laughs while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fuzz," repeats it every time. "they have already been gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang from Twitter users in Xinjang.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10 the mobile phone users received a mobile-to-date mobile phone users in Tianshan District in the city of Urumqi, where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, it is said that the app can get access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities finally emits the app for more than the fight of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app as soon after they had installed the app, messages with a private wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, that the app can determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service power with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage pornography, trojans and Phishing pages to make users aware of it, how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote actors or even hacker capable of reducing the home network of a person to manipulate or steal from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While the messages of digital censorship generally focused on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme ensurfers and monitoring measures, as well as routinely Internet switching circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The news-based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (released.), published news in China, showed photos of a checpoint point where the policemen of the residents had passed on whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people are using the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have been forced to use people who are thought for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through ambering technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (the same.) released a Jingwang product description, which means that the software can lift up the password needs of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unconditional access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphones in Xinjiang will be used to electronic handle.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the town-party council that minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental organizations, authorities and with the party, including universities and research facilities, are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office at the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">There are also a current report of at present House, an American Human Rights organization, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities released a Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a Regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorists" to identify and destroy. this action, however, violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them firming for a whole range of other possible charges, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I don't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I was accustomed to answer it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really say more precisely, when Belts and strokes after a friendly conversation for me become an ordinary communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me I said that I had to accuse me or misused to be punished, although I had nothing done to earn this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Sentence in all its diversity.</seg>

<seg id="2070">My cry did not make him enough, for why they exiled the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked once again as a garbage collection or whether it belonged to normal working conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables to interfere with each other, to present the ones from their viewpoint, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Three of them, during one single hour, three of them continued, while I still was in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all the feeling in my body - and also my voice, why I stopped to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker remarked the cooling, and found no pleasure in it, which is why he saw next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + Community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib gets most of his time inside the time. once, he chooses to his canvas, time to his computer, and again on his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be abandoned, a cigar among his fingers, or to discover his lips with nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, where Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank completed and saw Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For the past six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, referring to the conservative majority against gender, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapins.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often sets out with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian prisoners. all these topics are not only in their hometown of Amman Relevance, but also in cities that are rich from Damascus to Syria and Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib found himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through limits, and he can suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he is not openly available, it is advisable against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considered his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian Geoler of the second generation, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he is pounded in the water-soluble nest cafÃ© in two cups. it is the sacred month of Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensuous Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking of warm coffee and the dropping of Kent-cigarette in the nose are the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one casts a glance into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to do basic things, to do basic things, as in the public during the Ramadan water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committee that support the Islamist leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradict and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press conference in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert had been said" because of the sexual orientation of the singer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that authorizes the old proven legitimacy of legitimate regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian nation as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to continue" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be silly-silted rhetoric, but in fact a clear that is reflected in the crystal clear reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms turned to body by refusing his vision from the fate of arabic women who have had sex helpers.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence in them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of Honmorers' was seen in Jordan - the inofficial outside of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to human Rights Watch the number of honorary morde in 2016 reached its peak; however, there is still a thing that Jordan was missing to support women who tried to attempted murder or domestic violence to support themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fragile attacks from 1954, women who are subjected to danger of internal family violence, "and for their release, often a year-long bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to reinstances on topics that are lent in his own country as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denifies that his work is politically, but there is a dream that he is able to separate his music, the full expeditions of sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, husband.</seg>
<seg id="2125">My policy was declared to me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "" "" Ghareeb "" "" is the focus on poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically in the nucleus can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want, "it is faith or unbelief, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of pigs and reading, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals continued to be greatly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgramme Roya, to note that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts, but was only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that Intolerance against homosexuals do not speak Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuvo, a poet from the eighth century, who still has stayed in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuer shouldn't work once on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century could be open to homosexuality why?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so called Hdaib, did not have Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom it is nothing new, that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian secret service adopted several former government officials and members of the Teacher Association, with the accusation, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media, linked with the deep in the country-root corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of which, the concert of Hdaibs is to say only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian paper.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Proashrou'Leila has now been denied a performance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks like Hdaib. it is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib was dreaming, like millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He will not only dreams his work to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be backed by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental offence, and not due to bombs, streumbling and on artificial way of the democracy. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to tap and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to be heard as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant war ribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories in respect of the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival which is usually taken up in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the troops invaded by the west of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortresses are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet another wonderful way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were the outer appearance and body care as important as in this history, because they help to help the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote a legitimate profession as the fresher course.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru, such as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), has led to more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can trace this hairstyle hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairdresser, who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers of hairdressers of Batalla de Barberos, who has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts occur against each other to show who can create the exotic Looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos at current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, found in El Callao, found here a opportunity to utilize their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an apprenticeship in the hairstyle art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated from this activity and dedicated possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can seize a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to Guerilladefer</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the version of the Beiter's love-message to guerrilla fighters, "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel free to bring in affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Hostel, and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged letters to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the scene of a historical event, and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The foremark of peace agreement was considered as significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of columnans, however, it is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakefer who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons with themselves, must now be integrated into the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred, had to record them in their ranks and support them with the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnans join themselves together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the Campaign are 6900 letters - one of each former guerrilla fighters, who will then be handed to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them do more need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said he was told to share his love with people in this year, most of the most urgent cases.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now will have to build their place in society and make a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th at a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt was travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they did before, in order to meet the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of undertaking of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved parties. "it is amazing how many different feelings may walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between" and told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governors in the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighters brought me to the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cameras" (a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because beside him on bed, a MGL-pomegranate was a deadly weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what are she just?" he said, "" "" I am answering a letter which has written me. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before me in my life, someone wrote to me a nice thing, so I answer it. "I suddenly came down tears on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I woke him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this struggling, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company that is waiting outside with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Till now, I only learned how to handle weapons with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some of the FARC leaders came together to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up and grew up as a war, and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help to create a political party in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people have never found hearing, yet they had no electoral rights, and to recognize that people who had often seen as a monster, and even had learned only people with beautiful feelings that were shot through their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, in which the land lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed, and have done so much harm to bring us something, and can give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have given to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column has made evidence that, after defoaming peace, it would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are putting the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victim, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. for those among us that defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping maturing from the backseat of my car, I heard a manhood: "here is a gift for you of your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned my mind, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on the Chechnisch: "how long will you honour the family, and honour me?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything together and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Women had called a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had taken two keywords in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which the wings were placed - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated since there is still my male name, but the doctor stood and put me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his brush, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful for him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">After the last February I was threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, and some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an Alpine.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired to send me to Chechnya in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it without through the streets; others wanted that I had not changed my sex at Grozny in Grozny and I say that everything was only evil, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not just your family, but the whole Republic has damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she made a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened window discs and a numeric plate with a 95 hole.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I became clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists review the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I want to give up their names, but I want to say to them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without record, without reference, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checkup into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you believe not about, you warmest in security, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are on. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about genealogy, however, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I've always wear some traditional Caucassia elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">I do not wish to overcome this spiritual barrier. I can't overcome it.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chapped with camera, I really give myself effort to look like the person they remember from their past, so that I remember my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I was talking about someone who made a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during the Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan was hardly able to wait, and he did not switch a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, my I, they probably reload the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end, a proof that the so-called "honour" through blood satisfaction has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will now also be imprisoned in these secret products now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there would be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have not enough relatives or who were left of their relatives, to present Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are arrested there, so that they can be used as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As a result, these men would not have disappeared, but targeted to radical theory.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a dirty or do you have a source of that information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just spent someone who was imprisoned in Argun on one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was taken by themselves as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But now they were not presented as a banded, but there were yet no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave this person?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether those persecutions and deways of people, which have a so-called "non-traditional" orientation "took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I had been wearing my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I lived there - and I had never problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intended to bring us to the" Civilization "" "" but did ultimately go back into the stone age. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were grounded, I had colored eyelashes, bore RÃ¶omjeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Scharia is never trimmed by a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where you arrived every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as I met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemping: Kharda ma Kharda, which is: "spans not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children, when they make merging over sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never hurt me, never beaten and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this benefit look like?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak in television over Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Yet - you could feel how people began to catch in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had promised and laughed before, looked at the same with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I deserved not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreffs, Conferences, I understand them to the hospital, and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I'm not a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people even when I revolted a curse.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry any Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alavant.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no pigs at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Kabardiner, who also have Russians; on all the planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">So I get from there, that is why it is unpleasant to listen to something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them, practising Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting in the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transcripts to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his family to make more intimate experiences. but that's a chest.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and will not be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I am so personally personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups prior to an increase of self-morden within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the past few months there has been a strong increase of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the staggered situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety stands, depression, and he emit himself to his own helplessness to gain unability to his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had burned himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide bombed to him in August inside the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activist activists from the spot that even more men could have life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shake Tambo Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing common: they were all family fathers, which are based on the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and unable, to nourish their families, and to keep their safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it hard to endeavour to the local Arab population to contest her life.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Prior to a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took the power and undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran's oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most valuable and precious usable space for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continue to continue to slow down slowly, and the native population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Awazi-Arabians systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of demmen, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom are to derive.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the devastation and devastation in the region, and local agriculture, as well as fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab arzi-adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Koh, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who had a job, completed elementary school, and 55% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activists with residence in London told that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racist ethical discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ahwaz new, ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the integration process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions do not rely on Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will resume access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which causes it to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their lifetime outside of their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their preference and surname, in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, soften because the speaking of the Arab language or the Traging arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must suffer, human rights activist alarm activated before the situation will explosively.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world awaken and notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was posted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. article was the subject of several discussions where many different locations came to the expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, they react to many women - especially the white women who signify themselves as intersecular feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same formation.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women before or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that any discrimination on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, on raassism, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from Diaspora; if I chose to mention any kind of physical, spiritual and banned women, both in and beyond the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to mention the feminists of feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they are all interested in fact that women - all women are gathered together to lift up their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord's, to sing the equality of equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to speak that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutional form of rastic violence that we have been exposed to black women on two different way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnias and women earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background are more often referred to as the school as white girls, due to obvious integration issues.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black donors and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer, domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On one hand, I want to have all women, all men and all men, neither any skin colour that have any rights; on the other hand, I am unable to consider the white woman to take into account the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, that relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, that has always rejected me and countless other black women always.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "I also refusing me to justify an ideology in which the black woman is a human being and marginalised nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refills me to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs in order to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to disclose white women the importance of the cutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to disclose the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although Intersecular feminism was founded in order to give up a home to women in different information and to abolition of white feminism, the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I go ahead of myself, full and entirely of feminism to join me the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of me for a white feminist paradigm that is so hard to use as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and engage in the Spaces, which will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book of africana womanism: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves to our own kind, and not only that - black women may be able to keep the spiritual, spiritual, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements that make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interactive feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform themselves about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment, in which my life was neither addressed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they don't have anything against Luis Balbuena, her express partner who has been active in comparison to violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship was a little time passed and the police spoke, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further wife Balbuena due to mistreatment, the acute indication of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved back their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women refund ever at all, they do not receive support from the state in general.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also depend on men who have mistreated. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities.</seg>

"there are various statements and reports that show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there went a case of domestic violence against women in the district of Attorney Office. 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads were occupied by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peacekeeping forces. here, 86% of the ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women said of psychic Missions.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true dimension of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayischen Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these penguards are actually displayed. "on any woman who will not do in Paraguay because of psychic mistreatment, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who will be refunded because of physical mistreatment, two women who do not do" "" "declared it at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay was not an independent criminal law, the prosecution authorities cannot be documented appropriate, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of trafficking in women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">After their estimations in Paraguay, all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men.</seg>
<seg id="2503">"" "a shield with inscription:" "" "without a mediator no penalty." "" "# None Less" "" "photo of Jessie professionals from PÃ©rez. use with friendly permission." ""</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible Missions and a legal system that has nothing undertaking</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the solid girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that it was supposed to regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years she bore the psychic force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I thought that only women have happened to submitting them, because they are disguessed by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote entries on Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen like Carlos of Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed like that, when they wanted to say that victims of Missions had at least a certain fellow at it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner is mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women all in any way victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others on their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner was able to convince her to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without the result and also of their relatives, they had no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She carried a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly to money, power and influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very well, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of mistreatment is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, a draft law was discussed under the hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiagaMenos (# non-objections) are part of a campaign on Twitter being supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law stipulates that Femizid insisted to explain to an independent penance, as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text in some points changes in some points, so that the deputies for the law would be feared that the way for the criminalisation of abortions will be prohibited, who are generally forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to bear the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which have to bear the victims of violence themselves, if they just receive an indication and want to obtain a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law does not be effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient funding to this law:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a changeover must be held so that violence is no longer considered a little.</seg>
<seg id="2537">In view of these facts, the perpetrators will be guilty and contributes to it, that the perpetrators will come.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long ad, except for mistreatment no more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was adopted in the inaguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had changed. however, a passage was knitted among other things, which the partners were armed for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an occasion for the aggressor, to attack his victims.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper raged attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to a decision by the information Minister," on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the oman authorities closed an independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their reporting about corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to serve in prison, where he served a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and presented in court later again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur by a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The reign of Sultans is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, in particular, public liberties, including public freedom, including press freedom, to restrict and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, to be shy and incarcerely.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities detoxify peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and legitimate citizens, also activist their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions in both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closure, and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which since its foundation in 2007, has been reported about corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, took an article with the title of "High-ranking parties" hands of Justice "which was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, and the mixture of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise the judgment in a possession of a possession.</seg>

<seg id="2559">Photo source: the laptops of Azamn</seg>
<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the editorial Committee, was invited by the ISS in front of the Special Department and on his arrival from security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS took the Deputy CEO of Yousef Al-Haj, who had directed his editor after Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was shut down at indefinitely, after the information Minister had given the instruction that "the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first hearing was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Digi.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced both among others because of disturbance of public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "Understanding of the State of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a public audience and slander for a slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fines of $3,000 in each case (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year vocational prohibition was imposed on the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 giant (2600 US dollars), after the use of "an information network for spreading material which could represent an risk of public order" was found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-demoli, a damage deposit of 5000 omnia Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, Al-Digi, the Court of Appeal, sentenced Al-Haj to sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal also took up the decision of the information Ministry to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court, Azamn rebound again, the newspaper looks like attacks before attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Minister of Information issued a statement by the closure of "Alamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the information Minister was personally signed a further order in which the closure of "Alamn" has been extended by three additional months, with which the Minister decided again for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court, the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was injured in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, include the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country, its operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omnia authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditional exempt;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists may follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the press freedom in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman ensure their legal human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation measures, including judicial chicans, can exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) is an independent, non-governmental organization, the human rights defenders (including independent journalists, blogger, lawyers, etc.), in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries, to gather peacefully, and offers protection for them.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstanding</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, figure is made with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the demand of medically active medical research there are two reasons: to place a lack of medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa, and lack investments for research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, the research that is carried out by African scientists themselves will only be eligible for the development of own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit is director of the Centre for the research of infectious disease in Zambia (Centre for Infection Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">It grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself educated in the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to assist the sampled health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of the media on this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. in this way, I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion of the important current knowledge of knowledge in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we're just about solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient, rather than being greed.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not useable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find a suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are being supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who return or go back here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards of developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it lasts months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were to be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW-RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do and the stress access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be made available only for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: such as "open source" seed producers make the world's worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which is reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been supporting lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredoms, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA and astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been set only by its own accident and question how many salad leaves can get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of 2000 he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as wattability to diseases, a special red or green or molded leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been signed up to more plants such as grain or cartons varieties. due to this trends, plant-protective equipment and experts provide food safety around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionately representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still doesn't need salad, however, however, it is longer necessary to keep his work more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, when I have a rock in a rock, in order to get out of a rock." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents are too far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can tolerate any more of a new salads because all the features are patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tried to encourage the characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful not to use any material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also joined by a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" -ZÃ¼ges).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red RÃ¶mersalat the variety Outther in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there is tested whether plants can be grown up in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more such as if the movement originate from the IT-area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which offers alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plants and species are not being protected as intellectual property, and can be used for plant breeding facilities.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, just as Ossi, U.S. breeders can undertake to use that other of them are bred seeds free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they don't continue to make business with their seed and we can sell it. "open source" breeder only others who want to buy their seed, it is not necessary to apply it - two aspects which are forbidden through many vegetable oils or mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Damped outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the retired professor of Wisconsin University of Wisconsin and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to encourage new plants, both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays an important role in larger conforms such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the dietary system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, not or just a little by refusing seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg has emphasised that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, for example, we need control of ecological agriculture or not. "who wants to purchase good, locally, sustainable and sustainably productive vegetables, should also know that the fashion is bred, such as this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed stability is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commits itself to make other seed still available free of charge. in contrast to this, their benefits are to be patented in contrast, seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporter argue that the future of food supply may be endangered due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights to plant material that is thus unrestricted, unnegligible.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctorate thesis with generic Variation at karat and their availability. it was found that about one-third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, which means it either can not be used for planting machines either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet but experts like Luby suspect that mass plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as a lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visible</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they are targeted specifically for targeted features - of such that their taste or colour improves up to such as they thrive and threats such as pests and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary to be more than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduct will recognize that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. together with four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company set up for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is, however, the view that intellectual property is restrict other breeders, as "patents and protection of plant variations." a patent is basically taken up a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection measures not so innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it otherwise: 20 years to wait until a patent service, bring it no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long on it, to plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and it should continue to remain: "independent plant-makers have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaires incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers to work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it will be impossible to use it if we don't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton reveals Himself to patented plant features: "we do not really create the features for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as breeder, we have no idea to do it as plants that do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Plant Engineering, in the U.S. State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "he who chastened a variety, also stimulates his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes in industrial agriculture with large courts and monocultures, for whose cultivation will need to be herbicide needed to expand its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is geared. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, also without patents - either reject them or keep it for too expensive and therefore not be worthwhile or both of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant of plant Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would become more innovative by avoiding plant patrons: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new stuff to my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself, "he says." with a patent one is 20 years ahead of the competition with which it makes my opinion very much easy. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" discipline, but the concept is spread quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, a" open source "seed program works in the centre with farmers and helps them to encourage new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to get to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The Organisation Agree is an "open source" License, which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, absent for the Ossi commitment to be one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over.)</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still the Egyptian authorities unlock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columniest.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where it was criticized by the Egyptian authorities for this step, promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Legal Network for Human Rights Information is btful despite this attack and the constitution through the authorities, which had to pursue these objectives as it was not so important as now. ANHRI had been able to overcome these targets to overcome the blocking and do not exist. we insisted on it to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked off the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / /. co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI there is also no access to Egypt in the blog of columnists and human rights studies Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of Columbus and articles that he has not written in Egypt not accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he set up in order to prevent the Zenenapparatus of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is home to Ziadas blog in Germany, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and put a video on how the police executed physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to block is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is it for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, an incharging of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Summit of Thought and expression (AFTE), Egyptian officials from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), amongst others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by using Internet censorship and private surfers, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites, which offer VPNs, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates that the government's intention to block content, and to filter content, could have access to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation will be worsened that the Zensurgeries are taken behind the closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no cause with the help of which they can proceed against this action.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now question: how far is the Egyptian government is willing to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The citizens do dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with damping headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postage images.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old was shot in school," "" "The second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves smoothed pharmacy led by military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air forces to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a clamped financial situation, the violence in 2017 reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice called to intervene the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers find a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In this way, published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio well-known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the editorial article "This is not normal," in which she announced to establish a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the news:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexualabnormalities, etc. everything that happens in Rio will be published in the section called "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to close as journalists don't close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country which does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 fields, which are controlled by the criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if he is distorted, can also be used to misuse the police, who only shoot and ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than they are used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist, CecÃ­lia Oliveira, argued the violence as "war". in their opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and it could make it difficult to compute responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff, Enlightenment and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro's state is greater than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Especially the company Globo, the largest media company South America, has emphasised as CecÃ­lia, has been repeated since years of security policy.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these safety policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a Favela by means of a massive police force to conquer a Favela and a unity permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">Initially, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. since a couple of years, the UPP led the UPP after several reports about chicans and repressions against the poor churches which was to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why the power in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to the legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for people.</seg>

<seg id="2788">A week, it is now that the police remarked the mountain by the Favela Jacarezinho bridge, in order to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011, and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime compared to loyale troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Pax and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Especially strongly affected is the East Ghouta region where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out, based on the basis of investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacres committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebels have been controlled by rebel zones outside of Damascus, which led to the fact that inhabitants of local residents and control points have been consumed by tunnel and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the longlasting blockade are traditional food items such as meat unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a consequence, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics has taught the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call itself Ghiras Alnear here and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">These mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria, and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, they are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, its food is an attractive food source for many people of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The project of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to flesh, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reported Global Voices that has been fought for three years, this project has been proving and pressed his relief, that it is now more and more "to gain popularity."</seg>

<seg id="2815">It is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge about the plantation of fungi, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this writing, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations on Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators who keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel scarcity, locally produced materials from plastic are used to power the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with "production from the regions of the fungi" before they checked their quality and, if they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2821">Now they have conceived a "Teacher" for the region. "</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohottage. the work was hard and made it ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of its low wages, and went into Iran. once again he was found in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, heavier than he himself, to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," reminded in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open window, so that we do not have any service at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Ashark left his life without papers in Iran, and was ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church, which distributed twice a day of food to helpneeds.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance to apply an asylum seekers due to relatively high-desire quotas. however, it is true that conditions to apply asylum seekers in the country, catastrophic are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation of the Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the great majority of the asylum seekers will be housed in more than 3000" "" "Special trial centres." "" "there are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center when they officially took a request for asylum - what to register after the registration of the request for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation to either go to the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus also Ashark went.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his barren habit helped Ashark to release himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years he had made various works in the construction industry, Asharaf made his entire savings into the founding of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so well that he opened a second hostel and a quick open hostel after a while.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis success story is now on the theme of the Documentary Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(German:" behind the Venetian luxury - a hazara in Italy ") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film was awarded the Venice City Award, which was launched for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italian - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some of the Afghans operated companies, including slings, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmaddi had the idea to its restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menue of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts, the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneurs Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria of Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs aims to go far beyond the Italian food industry and retail sales, and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also possibilities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land, and I can't live happily, when I know he suffers from my people.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of the company and you need to get the same opportunities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark also describes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservatory techniques. "in this way, they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end stand stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark made this journey itself. now he would like to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot, the challenges, victories, and upcoming trends in the internet right</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament will review a draft law, which stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users have to be able to take advantage of the social networks within six months after the successful legislative resolution on the website of the authority, stating its complete name and record number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">He who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the Encounter-payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of parliament, is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament, and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Another deputies gave a legislative proposal to be introduced in the harsher penalties for the insult of the President or a high civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the Egyptian Law, the prevalence of the President and state facilities are already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal would be such a matter with prison and fines, then right-wing of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean by up to three years' imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Furthermore, this would have a political climate, in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A prominent example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo Zid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to demonstrating violence against demonstrators who had led against the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested for the same incident, four years in jail at a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May, because the prison line had failed, according to human rights groups, to bring the defendant from the prison quarters in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawhurricane threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups are longed, with others, arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza said the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary free of charge. they were indicted for their reporting on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who also were arrested for the first time in the previous year, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia suffered mainly to a transparent action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, according to the plan was expressly endorsed by the dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, accused amnesty amnesty decreed if all these were unjustified funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat published a light on how to look out the presizing plans to support the template.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources by specifying Article 11 of the Tunisian press release, journalists fully secures the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nonetheless he entered the district court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of information from the national council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write messages in social media or share.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the regulations it is indicated that registration will be required by full name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is now unclear how the authorities shall apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens suggested to social media, these regulations selects only selectively to protect people journalism and independence.</seg>

<seg id="2961">This designation is part of an Act of 2014, thanks to which the Russian government is a list of online services that can organise the "publication of information." the law allows the government to communicate and forced them on request for removal of users.</seg>
<seg id="2962">One of these websites are sites such as Vcontacts and Odnodniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
