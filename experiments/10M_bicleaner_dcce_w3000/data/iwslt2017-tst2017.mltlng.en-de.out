this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone belongs to Edward Snow@@ den , he wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA had illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c American intelligence service , in which the CIA had literally handed down dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter on that ?
the US Government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was promoted to the symbol of the government , in Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , to condemn journalists and journalists .
according to the first constitutional complaint , media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get these information and if they can &apos;t protect their identity , they offer them .
thus , when the government of R@@ isen ank@@ lo@@ p@@ ate , he did something , what many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ter already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual .
suddenly , in spite of many years , it was indispensable for their case , the demands of the government was dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and pen@@ sions to the statements , that also could finish his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and thus , the investig@@ ator , without his consent , wor@@ ried and wor@@ ried about his phone instructions ,
the same as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , his credit card and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to be Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA , Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and tears .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to his appeal , Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government has become too much of her work as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of having a Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in a repor@@ ter .
so we put the press work in the game which is to be protected by the first constitu@@ tion@@ aries , because the government has always more possibilities to send any more possibilities .
but just as the technology of the government permits to use the rights of rep@@ lic@@ ences , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can get it from the moment in which they get in contact , rather than in the back , in the witness .
today , it is a communication software that has not yet been written than R@@ isen his book , and it &apos;s much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source file system for Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet , which was developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today I have been working further by the Government of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , as is the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents as at any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the relevant news agency .
so the government cannot register any more information , and many of the information that would demand it would not be available from vor@@ n@@ in .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments on all over the world will always develop new sp@@ ying technologies that are all dangerous to us .
it is advis@@ able to ensure that there is not only technology products such as Edward Snow@@ den has a possibility to make abuse of abuse . it is equally important that we protect the next Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
the lack of abuse during the power supply of soldiers is modest and by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to the per@@ si@@ gh water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street In@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitu@@ ency .
thanks . thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data of the history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and powers &#91; is &#93; hidden in control phases . &#93; , we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global W@@ itness by one statement . &#93; this week we received from news about a che@@ que of 11 million documents created in Panama , Law@@ yers Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax phases .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you make it an anonymous company ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has resigned .
there are reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad sent letters based in star@@ vation .
it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading to Russia &apos;s close friend , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next publication , and on the next reve@@ aling documents .
now , it sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be removed from you , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powers are able to hide their wealth in tax bun@@ nies and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret control phases of a few weeks will be used to hide and un@@ veil@@ s -- a little which we discus@@ sing and reveal it for ten years .
I think many people appear this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these control phases will work .
I always put it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one is a company in another firm , in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it may be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the US .
probably because it has been no prominent Americans so far , that they found in those revel@@ ations that sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their wealth in tax phases .
but through the principle that they work after these control phases , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is the fact that in some U.S. states less information needs to indicate less information , in order to create a company as to give a library certificate .
in the US , this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees to zo@@ oming school children .
it is allowed to zoom off , especially vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here , with Global W@@ itness , we wanted to find out how all this would like in practice .
how does it work ?
thus , we sent a s@@ iting investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us that all up to one lawyer of our investig@@ ator did not transfer how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ deb@@ tors . no one of these lawyers participated in us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our covered investig@@ ator .
it is not possible to take a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is therefore how the system works , through corruption , tax s@@ cur@@ ses , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour .
this may be very grievous to sound , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing might have changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty one .
but as a little optimi@@ zer , I see that some things have begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen prec@@ urs@@ or to more transparency , what the owner of firms are concerned .
the subject found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really are behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the United States is back .
representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians but this does not power the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ ases , used as a means to ensure a medium in the USA and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global W@@ itness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people that are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy , who rise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deplo@@ y itself through the laws of the in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end this kind of tax cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I have almost been ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ ho@@ on sale .
a guy at the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he alone was in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
he invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I &apos;m tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just didn &apos;t get to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to get there in the luggage boot of a Maz@@ das !
that is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do I pray ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I stopped the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken off to me ?
a wild@@ land sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I went out of the bed , at the top of the door , and closed my sleeping bag .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought by me , is now in his class@@ room today . he is a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners came to me , actually friends who were waiting for them to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think , creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fel@@ ine Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something like this . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established such as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure to taste our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ts completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . as we joined our last guest and got the door into the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time ?
things came into rolling .
my former fel@@ ine , ne@@ ate Ble@@ ur@@ czyk , decided to serve us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether one could do this business concept .
for example , we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors you closes when you visit .
on the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next great thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would be ign@@ ited .
but he did not do it .
no one that is still in consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments other people .
why ?
because we are all learned as children , they are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can imagine the things you can do well . we were designed to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design much more than just look and H@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the general experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we would like to create great confidence , among people who had never met before .
can design make that something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a dietary sample , which degrees would have confidence .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ b high if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone in your left seat .
this silent attraction of Pan@@ ic , which you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts , if they open the first time the door .
for the only one , which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in your hands ?
most people feel responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only from this reason , our company can exist .
just once , who has actually made Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is the President of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have been introduced only once with his name , if he would have told where he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine , you would have 150 search messages that all say : &quot; he can really go very well @-@ locked phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to return your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence crucial .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard to give negative evidence for the people .
finally , we decided to wait until both the host as well as a guest had given their reviews , before we asked them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust in each other , depending on how they are similar to age and place of residence .
little unexpected we trust men most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ defined .
it is exciting when it adds to the call of a person -- in our case by error messages .
if one has less than three acts , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation among the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
Moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much people are offered by themselves .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells you too little like &quot; hi ! &quot; you do not get any answer .
I tell a lot like this : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of off@@ ence , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works in your dwelling place ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can you create it with design to produce this degree ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips to which themes should be written .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces compared to strangers .
with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people do our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that has not been covered before .
the business is just very good for us .
of course , there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are not allowed to have parties to have their homes or homes .
they have guests to stand in the rain .
I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front left when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing pain than these calls . it hurt even when I think only of it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , only a fraction of 123 million had a problem .
for people trust to each other .
if confidence works , it can create wonderful works .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him into the hospital .
he even finished blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks with heart attacks .
the area is beautifully decorated and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it at all .
you will drive one of your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they get books .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way , of course not runs every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve in the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this concept for the first time , I asked me :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trading .
but it is now just called &quot; rental industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not just .
share economy describes a trade , the human relations promises .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and accurate , but less authentic .
what would be , if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be , if at any place you have visited , a group where you would wait to fill a thoroughly with a corner of a bar @-@ bends , of which you have never heard .
or if you learn to cook about a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share one of the apartments for the mit@@ one .
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have thought of the common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and atten@@ d@@ ment .
in the South Korean capital , Seoul was already started this project . many parking places belonged to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were in search of a stay ,
were conve@@ yed in people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be guest in 191 countries for a stranger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
we have been there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and tim@@ ing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome frozen pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that blos@@ som ,
amazing to overwhelming .
I must think about that when a red Maz@@ da is over by me .
we are of course , of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use design next .
thanks . thank you .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ve wear , a terrorist group ?
or just a delay with security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people like I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage is negative about Islam and Muslims .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their hu@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to know you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ eg@@ s @-@ fitness fan@@ atic in ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear my heada@@ ches .
my fem@@ inist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you feel yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ ang was : at that time it was a fem@@ inist declaration of independence , namely , compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty supplement .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have to deal with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought about it , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she had confidence and slow del@@ ight@@ out , which deep@@ en itself with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to wines .
I know where God knows me . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever got the feeling that someone under@@ takes you , is fully under@@ stands , and does something like to love ?
so it feels .
later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the valley of the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then he came a terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flo@@ cked into buildings , people sp@@ un from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly to indignation .
why should one do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to the TV channel and listened to : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it wasn &apos;t just under my country , but in the N@@ u changed the deeds of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
on that same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how we drove me -- as we were silent -- as deep it went in my seat space , and I feared the first time when Muslims knew .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not care for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week inside .
then , it was on Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to Muslims .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw myself the extensive coverage .
the feelings were prudent and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or of people who held Muslims in the Free Syrian Army .
there were really bran@@ ces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right now .
because people who attacked this country had attacked our country .
I have conquered the rage of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have no questions , I love questions .
these are the alle@@ g@@ ations that are hard .
today we can hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to destroy Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the USA .
it &apos;s only the question : are we mal@@ icious or good @-@ like ?
you know : a mal@@ icious in@@ hi@@ bit has been removed as a whole and a good tumor to keep just under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but is a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , er@@ og@@ le and Olymp@@ ion@@ ic .
will I make the closing of mos@@ ques of America safer ?
it will perhaps be a few parking lots , but not stop terror .
regular visit to a mosque is to consider people of other faith with more toler@@ ant , and greater citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will actually be radi@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are employed in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer .
at the radio process , it is found that he will be cut online . as a result , the person of their church is cut off , even by their family , that the person believes , the terror@@ ists are true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
when we want to prevent radio alization , we need to stop the people to the mosque .
some are still speaking , Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS just@@ i@@ fies their breeding ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would like to insert ourselves into their prepar@@ atory world when they recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons in their &quot; Holy book &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when one casts a look at it , they do not pull them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their breeding ality that they can read these things in the Scri@@ ptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him because she had thought of joining the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . any cler@@ gy , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger was to bring their sense to un@@ righteousness in the world that she would only bring in trouble .
nothing inspired and something that was given to her rage , it was a main goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alisation through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised their own solution .
this Ima@@ m set the link to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their rage , he showed her constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
but what she learned in the Mos@@ que , she kept them to join the IS .
this was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : when we fear , there will happen at least three things .
we do not accept a authorized government system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : if you reports test individuals messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather dis@@ agree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the un@@ circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never related to terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq war and during two constitu@@ ent periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation to the public in order to wai@@ ve the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizen .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might sense it as the first but the toxic air of fear of us .
in case of collective debt , it is not only about to explain itself to themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , very promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most beautiful , most generous man , whom she knew .
she visited him there , and showed her his CV . she was angry , and she said ,
&quot; when is this a vain young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who in the afternoon too . he did it in her apartment , after he posted out@@ ings against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he enjoyed eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ ism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home ?
we contempl@@ ate it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was therefore what America we would like to thank our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we may exercise our religion free .
we decided to prepare for the mosque .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him , and took my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thanks and called our guests welcome , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , Ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to be attached to us .
in that moment I got together .
these people were there , because they were courage and experienced pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ci@@ ism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those who think .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so Dal@@ ia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say something that you might say that you &apos;re working with a T@@ ED@@ Talk , working with a deep thinking factory , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not deceive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims in the world , and I did it with the largest in the world in the whole world , people want to be normal things .
they want to make prosper@@ ity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in no respect .
if people appear as a rule , often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is short before being born .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before the air condition into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks ago . some years ago they started to fly with ropes .
with cl@@ amps , air conditi@@ on@@ ers achieve high speed and acceleration in closest space .
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ations and react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order to provide an autonomous system , it needs to be colle@@ c@@ tively known to the mobile objects where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
to present today , we use a new loc@@ alization technology by Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each plane machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board determine which the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest layer . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ ored starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient as a helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most of the starters , it can float , and has a great advantage of start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a turning point .
a limitation of tail@@ or is that they react to Tur@@ bul@@ lets such as wind arches .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter what is the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practice .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract issues relating to the core of the cause .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question .
helicopter are known about machines with a thousand moving parts , which rise up to viol@@ ate you .
before decades , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flights , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ti@@ dy .
un@@ long discovered we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ ating flight device . it was invented short in front of recently .
it only has a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no further positions or control space , only one prop@@ ellers .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the interior happens very much so that it can be stable and can move in the room everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear end . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it is right to throw it right , if all watch is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ dar@@ ing , this machine is here , the Omni@@ vor@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is absent in its alignment .
in this he receives the au@@ xili@@ aries of the skill ,
in all directions , in all directions , it doesn &apos;t matter where the direction he is turned , or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some models can be ordered in models , the rest will learn directly when flying .
let us see that .
if passengers should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise direction .
when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if also limited .
we will now demonstrate that , by doing a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic bul@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commer@@ cially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technologies and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there are just like a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in the development and the quar@@ ens@@ act .
it serves as a reminder , as wonderful and magical to our universe , and that it permits creative , cre@@ ep@@ tible things to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is pointed to the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , there were two black holes in a very far distant galaxy , so the mass of three suns in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
for this short moment , it sh@@ one more brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the world known to us .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
but their energy did not replace them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time frame even and explo@@ ded the universe in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events initially for a time .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a lively life on earth .
since then the earth has brought quite some : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people , and -- God arise , -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of specially cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to look for Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are roughly caused by col@@ lu@@ ding black holes .
most held them mad for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as a crazy Gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation was financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the L@@ IG@@ O detector , the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ um Gra@@ vit@@ ational Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , which improved the detection performance enorm@@ ously .
therefore , it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two Colom@@ bian black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on M@@ IT . he has studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their by Observ@@ atory like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a Gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ us@@ ability in the gradient of space and time .
during the pre@@ face of the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched towards a direction and into the other .
for illustr@@ ative instru@@ ctors , Do@@ ctors lead to the Rel@@ ativity of rel@@ ativity often a true al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed by us . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average human being was 10 highly -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st which was declared the L@@ IG@@ O @-@ employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absur@@ d , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on Gra@@ ph
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves in the way : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are fin@@ alist and with the support of public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims to say L@@ IG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I would explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : visual coatings , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . for this way , you can custom@@ ize a picture or card of things by taking it on several points of the light around you .
in killing is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it &apos;s very difficult to produce a picture of things that are particularly great :
face to your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to specific characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now speaks Alice &quot; now .
&quot; and Bob does not break her . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can not produce any simple images of objects in all .
but when we make changes to the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we can convert wave pattern in sc@@ all , we can listen to all of that .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where my colleague Scott has already been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , blue pen easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cl@@ ings with an additional sound change . that &apos;s the following commands :
it is a kind of movement , shaped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard L@@ IG@@ O following : &#91; Sur@@ render the noise &#93; J@@ ill , who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as noise of -- SH ... two black holes with 30 times the solar mass , which are about as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : we think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in the All , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net has a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to all listen and listen to the invisible .
many in all we can do -- practically or generally -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ia star in super nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
however , the exciting physical techniques happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through since these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the urn is covered by its own offspring .
with the aid of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most important thing : I &apos;m optimi@@ stic that in all things we have never seen , that we will never see and from whom we have never seen any idea . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the same start at the first start , which we did not expect .
my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says on this topic : ME : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like L@@ IG@@ O , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the suction bone of our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to pass a completely different eye @-@ angle to the events in the All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as much as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory - a completely new generation of Observ@@ atory on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the pri@@ cr@@ ate itself ?
now is the time big dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks . thank you .
I tried a experiment before some time .
for one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared .
no matter whether it was nervous that brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
do I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I like to begin with the scene ?
no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , talk to keep my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life completely to un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my smallest ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ ald . and Emer@@ ald , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; estim@@ ation , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; valu@@ ate , I need milk for my mu@@ c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her , when I was straight on the jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I swear to me , always with them , as soon as you feel me , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always yes -- each one time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I make an effort very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amaz@@ ingly tri@@ umph@@ ant effect : only in front of short I understood I was fully informed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things , awake to life .
a dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
a dream job .
I create TV . I productive television .
I have television , in a large style .
in this TV @-@ season I &apos;ve been responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 @-@ hours TV . three to four shows are available at the same time .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my TV series will start one after the Thursday night .
all over the world , my series run in 256 different regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts which I have created , and not only produced , so still ob@@ tain@@ able . I have to find time , really st@@ illness , creative time to gather my fans of bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who this makes ?
nobody , so I am a titanium .
a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you to all of you who are so hard to work if you talk a company or a class@@ room , so if I talk about work , so that I am not just around a computer while I say , I understand that there is a dream of dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I put tro@@ ups on , then I painted on a screen .
as a dream , you have a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , lab@@ orious and dis@@ rup@@ tive , funny and the matern@@ al , cru@@ el and r@@ ational , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s hear it as a busy street , I could go for ever on .
many people participate , if I tell them the sum@@ s , I persu@@ ade me that the letter is prepared to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started working with the television production when I began to work and work , to create and collabor@@ ating , I discovered this thing to create this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the letter .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the mar@@ es is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t change differently as to size .
the feeling that could not be otherwise agreed as to size , no matter what the price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ olic to be .
maybe it &apos;s for gen@@ ius .
maybe it is called E@@ go .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of a failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I do not know that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a titanium , and I don &apos;t want to ask it in question .
to make a clear : the more shows , the more shows , the more the more clearly shows , the more things more , the more things more , the more I observe , the more I write story , the more expectations it gives .
the more I work to be successful , the more I must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , aren &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon , which I am running , the army , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ stress , over@@ drive , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ om is one worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ gency says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I would like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the kids of a Titan@@ en .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard it .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 @-@ hour @-@ day , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , not deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps not , is not available with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so , what do you do , if that is what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you do it works , you love to be a teacher , a painter , you love one another , and that &apos;s what the sum@@ s feels , and knows how to stop the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song li@@ stens to my heart , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ iter came to me into a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say so , I &apos;ll be aware of two things :
first , I must say Yes to everyone and secon@@ dly , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
it does not call any more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I &apos;ll take it when I &apos;m running Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and overcome her sisters , we laugh@@ ing a lot and I read off very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the lack of the way , I can &apos;t do anything except that .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high sound - they exist no more .
all that exists , stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id nuts , tender voices , wax sti@@ pen@@ cils and song , in which it goes to go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen leaves . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happened .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the Titan@@ ens@@ um , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who are you when I am telling you who I am when I compla@@ ining my brain by means of broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I have forgotten what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , who comes from the life of life .
the true sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the print of the history , to the complete tasks , expectation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps because God didn &apos;t forget the wrong words , for what God said to me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I usually make it a permanent rule , so that I can deliver me as a work@@ olic of everyone .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games I don &apos;t like it .
I do not play any more about doing so , how to work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , for I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as a home .
this confession is painful , for what a man works rather than to be a house ?
well yes , I .
time to be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too long is none of it .
we ras@@ a in the garden , ahead and back and forth .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff@@ ing , absent , and confused .
I always take you to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe have filled me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say ! they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you can hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
there you will be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they come back , that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , it replaces a Marien@@ cem@@ et@@ le or K@@ eks .
and speak my teenagers daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad @-@ mood @-@ day !
15 minutes a piece !
no cell phone , no laundry , no reduction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my prosper@@ ity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true that sum@@ s down to feel a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not playing games with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
give yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find it out and store it .
I am not perfect in it . I qu@@ icker and I think . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; it &apos;s short for everything I had abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training , when I wanted to make myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece why not full 15 minutes to allow ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return then I &apos;m not working .
works do not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open , and I find me in my office . I hear an unknown melody , she fills me and my soul . she runs me to new ideas . I use it into full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
bubbles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of labor is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grat@@ eful .
it &apos;s hard to me that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the cle@@ arer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s , the marathon , I run the marathon , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel the more , the more makes this unusual , floating , nu@@ de and new life feeling within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things I think you would like to live .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that &apos;s probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; with im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain , in order to influence the control circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease which led among heavy trembling and heavy pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro cure .
the Dream of Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician , working day and night in the emergency intake .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , you must touch the brain and to increase the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save lives , you have to reduce the skull of the skull .
sometimes one has to remove a piece of s@@ wollen brain .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a Bi@@ ologist who analyse brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a slight task .
cells of a tissue is comparable , comparable with quite small children who can be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it was Jean François @-@ François .
it looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a trunk @-@ cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you may know of the Bi@@ ological lessons , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells conce@@ aled differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we have seen a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand , from where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of the cer@@ eb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near to the brain .
but that is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cellular source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain in the non @-@ language area and then the cells were exactly as cultivated as it was Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the entrance examination of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation - Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ al transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we noticed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had completely disappeared completely , they would have been taken back . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we had an infr@@ in@@ gement and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained , they came up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we t@@ opped in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop this here .
does these cells help a monkey , to recover from a brain infr@@ in@@ gement ?
thus , we trained apes with a manual de@@ x@@ able task .
you had to take feeding pellets with a tablet .
they made it very well .
as they achieved a stable operation level , we were able to have the motor@@ ized Cor@@ tex into the motor @-@ motor range .
then the monkeys were bo@@ red , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they would go spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover it with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they want to recover a certain degree , just as the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side you can see the monkeys that was spont@@ ane@@ ously repeated .
it can perform approximately 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance before injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation .
I can tell you , we were also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still going to im@@ press them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that there are now several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I definitely have .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are , before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ ate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and these therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it enable us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ centre study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at T@@ ED and that you have told us of it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to look at it as un@@ changeable risk .
we believe that capitalism does not lead to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ parall@@ eled .
in fact , the democracy change with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared a financial minister in the Euro@@ group of un@@ miss@@ able that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programmes , which were implemented in Greece .
in that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v or the Communist Party of China , or some of my delayed friends who would have repeated me if she would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce a real model for real democracy .
I pray you , together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but we might need to save democracy , but that we need a wonderful and serious democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mil@@ ked to our future , and sp@@ ends our great , new technologies .
on the subject of dis@@ rup@@ ting I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction , the currently our business ships are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin peak @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the school of the school , which casts his long shade about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only few recognize his ken@@ nel .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the waste spar@@ es and corpor@@ ations , which is to be fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest there where it would be productive and income could be able to produce and even all the things that humans are urgent , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro zone , in all the well @-@ being productive goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , and so on .
a total of 3.4 trillion US dollars would result in much money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes , and to rub the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms .
the results are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old man in the USA , Japan and Europe , who wants to carry down a low demand in which they do not invest . just like est@@ pus Father , who could not invest in fear that his son will kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that it k@@ ills him k@@ ills him .
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
its extremely tigh@@ tening capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially to finance human technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth .
is it the solution ?
I already believe . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , the Free and the poor as a majority rule the government .
the ath@@ ic democracy ended up many of course --
women , foreigners , and natural slaves .
however , there would be a mistake to reduce the pitch value of the ath@@ ic democracy based on these expres@@ sions .
the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that she gave the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial , that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal rights weigh@@ ting in questions of state ton@@ gs .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy is not held for a long time --
like a candle that lights very light , it is also broken down quickly .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy had only occurred when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed on policy , while the economy -- therefore the world of the group -- a demo@@ cra@@ cies free zone .
in our modern demo@@ cra@@ cies , since that time , the separation of politics and business began , an un@@ her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two and the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics and destroyed them .
are you w@@ anting out why the politicians do not have more than before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is about it that men can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is mig@@ rated and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nourished , that they are star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that has increased politics as far as far . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , political goods are increasing , the ine@@ quality demand is increasing , the overall economic demand and the managing director of the Group are fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash of their company .
the more successful of capitalism , &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the greater will be the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosper@@ ity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to put together the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
Inci@@ dentally , this is not a new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t sunny good .
the training of the de@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only be recovered from a miracle such as in the ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : remove the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing the low @-@ wage employed by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long economy and politics separate areas , the automation can be higher , the waste sub@@ strate , and the social conflict deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ shap@@ ing the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and we consider that we will be in a disease @-@ called hyper@@ auto @-@ bureau@@ cracy which allows the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary film .
so the question is not , if capitalism , the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism are replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the machines in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or re@@ sembles those of the society into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations with the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optimi@@ stic .
what would it like to do this , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to mention you , in all brief , some examples .
in the area of the company : please make a capital market in which one will earn money , while you are working and in which your capital will follow you by a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and income from redeemed and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those who are not working there , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong to those who don &apos;t hear . no diving between capital and savings , no big g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately no means of the twin @-@ minded peak .
in the area of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies had one freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interests of the entire human@@ kind .
imagine that the total world trade is traded in this currency , we call it &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; and every government pay the sum of the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment is ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical means at that time .
today , we have them , in particular before the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world that I &apos;ll describe you is at the same time liber@@ ator , in which they preferred privileged persons and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash@@ mere of the history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ese , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ese .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide on political .
it is in our hands , and we are doing it better .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself as the liberal mar@@ xi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something from what I said just is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do not do this , technological development generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry sum@@ mer as &quot; long term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we know it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant .
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ ling .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday when dinner of the Red@@ ner have you very clearly said what you keep from the view@@ point of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large dimension of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we limited the democracy on politics , during the area where most of the economy , - the area of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cra@@ cies free zone .
in a sense when I may tell the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is quite similar to the England of the 19th century .
because - remember - we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically viewed .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , that affects the democratic development .
what to observe now in China , re@@ sembles very the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now therefore refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this is coming .
BG : yeah ...
how do you look back six months later on the first six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ counter@@ f@@ eit detection , and the persistent delay of the Eurozone fell by the euro zone , and continue to continue the development of the entire European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity to decide on the basis of Greek demonstrations -- the by the way , the first proposal it was revealed .
it is correct to make it . unfortunately , the power is elected within the euro zone , in the European group , the denied .
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries an economic system , which is not viable , by political will and authority ar@@ ism in life , it will perhaps be able to catch a while , yet if the change happens , he happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any fault in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously red ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in a so cl@@ amped situation , he claims not a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honour@@ able interest on pages of the wal@@ kers to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to cause our government to fall , only because they did not deal with the cont@@ est@@ ors who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand for a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c programme for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the Money , which imposed on us this policy , was revealed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ ine error . &quot;
BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite different per European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone in comparison to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive .
because if they do not survive , the em@@ etz@@ e@@ ders will be demon@@ ic forces and destro@@ ying the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c consequences alone for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we jum@@ ped ourselves to the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will be also toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you will be wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy had arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ Production of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for it , shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not choose any .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are located on the right side of the turn .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the average rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ tive where you have seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- &quot; that &apos;s what you should say about this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry to do on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on average withdrawal , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good or bad , they don &apos;t in@@ spire .
so he must make sure that he is really at the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon has something makes , therefore Roy does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects 8 candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if you get out for free things , you don &apos;t matter what is right ?
millions of people look at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed in the view of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that all receive it .
you capture when one starts the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , what parts you can ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 on and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- a bit above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has shown a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy it is always in search to find this a super show and he uses data for it , but it does something different .
rather than to organize a competition , he and his team saw the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows of which shows you like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows you like what kind of producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went to a venture , and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 @-@ rating based on this curve . thus , where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent and personal data .
they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic came somehow , that the work should work with everything .
if you colle@@ cts millions of data , for a decision one meets , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computer .
the min@@ est thing that can be expected , is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is a terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we have more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company multi @-@ Health system ?
no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room is ever coming into contact with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison in the USA and asks the release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not the fact that a company like multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data .
the data diversi@@ fy firms are sometimes in@@ correct .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predi@@ ct the out@@ breaks of flu , the worst type -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news . the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it was fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it didn &apos;t work yet , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data thr@@ ott@@ est firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes sometimes understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data flows into the decisions of life , -- at the workplace , in case of legislation , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gen@@ etics - an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions , based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , they mainly do two things :
as a result , you cut this problem into its components that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place you set up the single parts to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and assemble it again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision .
for that there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces , even if the information is in@@ complete , in order to deal with a good decision - especially if it is the brain &apos;s brain .
therefore , I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to assemble all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision on this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
on the other hand , on the other hand , the wrong way did .
they use data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision , because they always could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are shooting when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget not this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is amazing . for decisions by using a Ja@@ ha@@ ge or No question you need only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll be rele@@ asing a technique later with a technique .
I have taken some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated means , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the fundamental body .
thus perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . eventually , it is about us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve .
and I felt this as very encour@@ aging news that , in spite of the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks going to enter .
for at the end there is not the data , but the risks where you meet at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
