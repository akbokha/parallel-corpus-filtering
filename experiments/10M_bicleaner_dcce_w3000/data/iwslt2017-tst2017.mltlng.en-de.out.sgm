<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone belongs to Edward Snowden, he wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA had illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic American intelligence service, in which the CIA had literally handed down drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter on that?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was promoted to the symbol of the government, in Whistleblower, to condemn journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional complaint, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get these information and if they can't protect their identity, they offer them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government of Risen anklopate, he did something, what many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, in spite of many years, it was indispensable for their case, the demands of the government was dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and pensions to the statements, that also could finish his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, the investigator, without his consent, worried and worried about his phone instructions,</seg>
<seg id="21">The same as its e-mail data, financial and banana information, his credit card and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to be Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA, Whistleblower and tears.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to his appeal, Whistleblower in Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government has become too much of her work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of having a Whistleblower in a reporter.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work in the game which is to be protected by the first constitutionaries, because the government has always more possibilities to send any more possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government permits to use the rights of replicences, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can get it from the moment in which they get in contact, rather than in the back, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, it is a communication software that has not yet been written than Risen his book, and it's much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source file system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet, which was developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and today I have been working further by the Government of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, as is the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents as at any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot register any more information, and many of the information that would demand it would not be available from vornin.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments on all over the world will always develop new spying technologies that are all dangerous to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is advisable to ensure that there is not only technology products such as Edward Snowden has a possibility to make abuse of abuse. it is equally important that we protect the next Whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the power supply of soldiers is modest and by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to the persigh water of Flint. or a Wallstreet Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constituency.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data of the history was released.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and powers [is] hidden in control phases.], we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness by one statement.] this week we received from news about a cheque of 11 million documents created in Panama, Lawyers Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you make it an anonymous company?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad sent letters based in starvation.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading to Russia's close friend, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next publication, and on the next revealing documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, it sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be removed from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powers are able to hide their wealth in tax bunnies and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret control phases of a few weeks will be used to hide and unveils -- a little which we discussing and reveal it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these control phases will work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one is a company in another firm, in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because it has been no prominent Americans so far, that they found in those revelations that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their wealth in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle that they work after these control phases, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is the fact that in some U.S. states less information needs to indicate less information, in order to create a company as to give a library certificate.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the US, this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees to zooming school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to zoom off, especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here, with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this would like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Thus, we sent a siting investigator into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to one lawyer of our investigator did not transfer how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all predebtors. no one of these lawyers participated in us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not possible to take a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is therefore how the system works, through corruption, tax scurses, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may be very grievous to sound, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing might have changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty one.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a little optimizer, I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen precursor to more transparency, what the owner of firms are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who really are behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is back.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians but this does not power the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax haases, used as a means to ensure a medium in the USA and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people that are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy, who rise and say:" "" "intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deploy itself through the laws of the intransparent." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end this kind of tax curses, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I have almost been abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backhoon sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy at the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He alone was in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">He invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I'm tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't get to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to get there in the luggage boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How do I pray?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I stopped the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken off to me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildland sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I went out of the bed, at the top of the door, and closed my sleeping bag.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought by me, is now in his classroom today. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners came to me, actually friends who were waiting for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new feline Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something like this. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to taste our cheese-ham-Omelts completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. as we joined our last guest and got the door into the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former feline, neate Bleurczyk, decided to serve us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could do this business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">For example, we presented ourselves to investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors you closes when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next great thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But he did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one that is still in consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we are all learned as children, they are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can imagine the things you can do well. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design much more than just look and Haptic -- it is the general experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we would like to create great confidence, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make that something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a dietary sample, which degrees would have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone in your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent attraction of Panic, which you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts, if they open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only one, which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just once, who has actually made Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been introduced only once with his name, if he would have told where he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 search messages that all say: "he can really go very well-locked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to return your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-thought feedback system strengthens the confidence crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to give negative evidence for the people.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both the host as well as a guest had given their reviews, before we asked them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust in each other, depending on how they are similar to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little unexpected we trust men most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predefined.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when it adds to the call of a person -- in our case by error messages.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three acts, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation among the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much people are offered by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells you too little like "hi!" you do not get any answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">I tell a lot like this: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of offence, e.g. "Tolle works in your dwelling place! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to produce this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips to which themes should be written.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices compared to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people do our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that has not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed to have parties to have their homes or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">They have guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront left when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing pain than these calls. it hurt even when I think only of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, only a fraction of 123 million had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, it can create wonderful works.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even finished blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks with heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautifully decorated and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You will drive one of your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they get books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This way, of course not runs every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve in the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this concept for the first time, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now just called "rental industry" to call it, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade, the human relations promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and accurate, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you have visited, a group where you would wait to fill a thoroughly with a corner of a bar-bends, of which you have never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you learn to cook about a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share one of the apartments for the mitone.</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have thought of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us and relationships, instead of solitude and attendment.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korean capital, Seoul was already started this project. many parking places belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were in search of a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed in people whose children were moved out. incubator were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be guest in 191 countries for a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We have been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome frozen prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Amazing to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must think about that when a red Mazda is over by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We are of course, of course, that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use design next.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brave wear, a terrorist group?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay with security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people like I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage is negative about Islam and Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their huber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to know you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagegs-fitness fanatic in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear my headaches.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you feel yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustang was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely, compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty supplement.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to deal with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought about it, doubted and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She had confidence and slow delightout, which deepen itself with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik sometimes brings me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know where God knows me. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever got the feeling that someone undertakes you, is fully understands, and does something like to love?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the valley of the Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then he came a terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eileen."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flocked into buildings, people spun from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly to indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I moved to the TV channel and listened to:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "jihad..." ""... "bombed Mecca!" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It wasn't just under my country, but in the Nu changed the deeds of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On that same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how we drove me -- as we were silent -- as deep it went in my seat space, and I feared the first time when Muslims knew.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be careful" "" "be careful," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "do not care for you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, it was on Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw myself the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were prudent and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or of people who held Muslims in the Free Syrian Army.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brances on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right now.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have conquered the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have no questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to destroy Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's only the question: are we malicious or good-like?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malicious inhibit has been removed as a whole and a good tumor to keep just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but is a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, erogle and Olympionic.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will I make the closing of mosques of America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will perhaps be a few parking lots, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque is to consider people of other faith with more tolerant, and greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people will actually be radialised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are employed in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radio process, it is found that he will be cut online. as a result, the person of their church is cut off, even by their family, that the person believes, the terrorists are true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radio alization, we need to stop the people to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still speaking, Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS justifies their breeding ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to insert ourselves into their preparatory world when they recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy book".</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "but when one casts a look at it, they do not pull them what they read in their" Holy Scripture. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their breeding ality that they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had thought of joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. any clergy, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger was to bring their sense to unrighteousness in the world that she would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that was given to her rage, it was a main goal for instrumentalisation through extremists who promised their own solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the link to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their rage, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">But what she learned in the Mosque, she kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: when we fear, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept a authorized government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you reports test individuals messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather disagree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the uncircumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never related to terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq war and during two constituent periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation to the public in order to waive the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might sense it as the first but the toxic air of fear of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In case of collective debt, it is not only about to explain itself to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, very promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most beautiful, most generous man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her his CV. she was angry, and she said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is this a vain young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who in the afternoon too. he did it in her apartment, after he posted outings against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He enjoyed eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatiism can not only be morally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We contemplate it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was therefore what America we would like to thank our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we may exercise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to prepare for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him, and took my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanks and called our guests welcome, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers, and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to be attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I got together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they were courage and experienced panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of anxiety and fanciism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than those who think.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say something that you might say that you're working with a TEDTalk, working with a deep thinking factory, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not deceive. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims in the world, and I did it with the largest in the world in the whole world, people want to be normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to make prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in no respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, is short before being born.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air condition into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks ago. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">With clamps, air conditioners achieve high speed and acceleration in closest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulations and react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to provide an autonomous system, it needs to be collectively known to the mobile objects where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">To present today, we use a new localization technology by Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each plane machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board determine which the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest layer. e.g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailored starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient as a helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most of the starters, it can float, and has a great advantage of start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailor is that they react to Turbullets such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter what is the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract issues relating to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about machines with a thousand moving parts, which rise up to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flights, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a rear tidy.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong discovered we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplating flight device. it was invented short in front of recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinges and cross-ruder, no further positions or control space, only one propellers.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the interior happens very much so that it can be stable and can move in the room everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear end. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it is right to throw it right, if all watch is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in gendaring, this machine is here, the Omnivorter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is absent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this he receives the auxiliaries of the skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In all directions, in all directions, it doesn't matter where the direction he is turned, or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models can be ordered in models, the rest will learn directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If passengers should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that, by doing a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic bulwarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technologies and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there are just like a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in the development and the quarensact.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, as wonderful and magical to our universe, and that it permits creative, creeptible things to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is pointed to the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, there were two black holes in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, it shone more brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the world known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not replace them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time frame even and exploded the universe in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially for a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a lively life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought quite some: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people, and -- God arise, -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of specially courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for Gravitational waves, which are roughly caused by colluding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them mad for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a crazy Genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation was financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the LIGO detector, the laser interferometrium Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of LIGO increased significantly, which improved the detection performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two Colombian black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has studied Gravitational waves from black holes and their by Observatory like LIGO measurable signals. what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A Gravitational wave is a crousability in the gradient of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the preface of the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched towards a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative instructors, Doctors lead to the Relativity of relativity often a true albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stressed by us. the elongation of an average human being was 10 highly -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st which was declared the LIGO-employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandths of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on Graph</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after the waves in the way: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finalist and with the support of public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims to say LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: visual coatings, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for this way, you can customize a picture or card of things by taking it on several points of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it's very difficult to produce a picture of things that are particularly great:</seg>
<seg id="512">Face to your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks Alice" now.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob does not break her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not produce any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But when we make changes to the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we can convert wave pattern in scall, we can listen to all of that.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, where my colleague Scott has already been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, blue pen easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, one hears the same circlings with an additional sound change. that's the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, shaped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard LIGO following: [Surrender the noise] Jill, who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as noise of -- SH... two black holes with 30 times the solar mass, which are about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in the All, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet has a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to all listen and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many in all we can do -- practically or generally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseria star in super novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical techniques happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the urn is covered by its own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most important thing: I'm optimistic that in all things we have never seen, that we will never see and from whom we have never seen any idea. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the same start at the first start, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the suction bone of our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to pass a completely different eye-angle to the events in the All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory - a completely new generation of Observatory on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the pricrate itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">I tried a experiment before some time.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it was nervous that brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Do I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I like to begin with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talk to keep my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life completely to unexpectedly. it started with a question of my smallest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerald. and Emerald, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all "estimation,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"valuate, I need milk for my mucabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her, when I was straight on the jump." "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-setting in my family. from there I swear to me, always with them, as soon as you feel me, or whither I go, I say always yes -- each one time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I make an effort very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "" "" "but it also has an amazingly triumphant effect: only in front of short I understood I was fully informed that" "" "Yes" "" "to play with my children my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things, awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I productive television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have television, in a large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I've been responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70-hours TV. three to four shows are available at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will start one after the Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 different regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts which I have created, and not only produced, so still obtainable. I have to find time, really stillness, creative time to gather my fans of bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, so I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you to all of you who are so hard to work if you talk a company or a classroom, so if I talk about work, so that I am not just around a computer while I say, I understand that there is a dream of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deeper into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I put troups on, then I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream, you have a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, laborious and disruptive, funny and the maternal, cruel and rational, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums hear it as a busy street, I could go for ever on.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate, if I tell them the sums, I persuade me that the letter is prepared to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started working with the television production when I began to work and work, to create and collaborating, I discovered this thing to create this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the letter.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The mares is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't change differently as to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that could not be otherwise agreed as to size, no matter what the price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workolic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's for genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I do not know that I am not for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a titanium, and I don't want to ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more shows, the more shows, the more the more clearly shows, the more things more, the more things more, the more I observe, the more I write story, the more expectations it gives.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, aren't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon, which I am running, the army, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstress, overdrive, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is one worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emergency says: "estimation, I would like to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the kids of a Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard it.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15-hour-day, performed weekends, no remorse, not delegate, a titanium sleeps not, is not available with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do, if that is what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think," "" "hay you," "" "the author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you do it works, you love to be a teacher, a painter, you love one another, and that's what the sums feels, and knows how to stop the sums, if you stop the sums, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song listens to my heart, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waiter came to me into a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says:" "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say so, I'll be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everyone and secondly, she called me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call any more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I'll take it when I'm running Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and overcome her sisters, we laughing a lot and I read off very dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the lack of the way, I can't do anything except that.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the high sound - they exist no more.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists, sticky fingers and humid nuts, tender voices, wax stipencils and song, in which it goes to go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen leaves."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happened.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the Titanensum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who are you when I am telling you who I am when I complaining my brain by means of broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, who comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the print of the history, to the complete tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sum of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps because God didn't forget the wrong words, for what God said to me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually make it a permanent rule, so that I can deliver me as a workolic of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in games I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I do not play any more about doing so, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man works rather than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Time to be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too long is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasa in the garden, ahead and back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiffing, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take you to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how you live, and the sums of the universe have filled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you can hold me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you will be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they come back, that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, it replaces a Mariencemetle or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenagers daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad-mood-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no reduction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my prosperity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true that sums down to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not playing games with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I quicker and I think. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" it's short for everything I had abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training, when I wanted to make myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece why not full 15 minutes to allow?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return then I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works do not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door open, and I find me in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fills me and my soul. she runs me to new ideas. I use it into full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of labor is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's hard to me that I am a titanium. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums, the marathon, I run the marathon, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel the more, the more makes this unusual, floating, nude and new life feeling within me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I think you would like to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" Yes "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That's probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." with implanted a electrode deeply in the brain, in order to influence the control circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which led among heavy trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The Dream of Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician, working day and night in the emergency intake.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at the skull-Hirn-traumata, you must touch the brain and to increase the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to reduce the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes one has to remove a piece of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a Biologist who analyse brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a slight task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue is comparable, comparable with quite small children who can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it was Jean François-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">It looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a trunk-cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you may know of the Biological lessons, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells concealed differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We have seen a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand, from where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of the cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near to the brain.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cellular source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain in the non-language area and then the cells were exactly as cultivated as it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the entrance examination of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation - Autotranal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we noticed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had completely disappeared completely, they would have been taken back. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had an infringement and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained, they came up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we topped in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop this here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Does these cells help a monkey, to recover from a brain infringement?</seg>
<seg id="865">Thus, we trained apes with a manual dexable task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feeding pellets with a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable operation level, we were able to have the motorized Cortex into the motor-motor range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were bored, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they would go spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover it with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they want to recover a certain degree, just as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side you can see the monkeys that was spontaneously repeated.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can perform approximately 40% to 50% of its initial performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, we were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still going to impress them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that there are now several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely have.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are, before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delikate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and these therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it enable us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as unchangeable risk.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism does not lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large imitators in Beijing have doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy change with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared a financial minister in the Eurogroup of unmissable that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programmes, which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yv or the Communist Party of China, or some of my delayed friends who would have repeated me if she would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce a real model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me again that Lee Kuan Yv, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save the democracy, but we might need to save democracy, but that we need a wonderful and serious democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are milked to our future, and spends our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of disrupting I would like to point to an interesting contradiction, the currently our business ships are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peak-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and know him as the school of the school, which casts his long shade about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his kennel.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the waste spares and corporations, which is to be frightened to invest there where it would be productive and income could be able to produce and even all the things that humans are urgent, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the euro zone, in all the well-being productive goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">A total of 3.4 trillion US dollars would result in much money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges, and to rub the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The results are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old man in the USA, Japan and Europe, who wants to carry down a low demand in which they do not invest. just like estpus Father, who could not invest in fear that his son will kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that it kills him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely tightening capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially to finance human technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is it the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I already believe. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, the Free and the poor as a majority rule the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy ended up many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and natural slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be a mistake to reduce the pitch value of the athic democracy based on these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athic democracy was and is that she gave the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal rights weighting in questions of state tongs.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy is not held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very light, it is also broken down quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy had only occurred when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed on policy, while the economy -- therefore the world of the group -- a democracies free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our modern democracies, since that time, the separation of politics and business began, an unhereditary struggle between the two and the economy gradually migrated to politics and destroyed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wanting out why the politicians do not have more than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about it that men can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is migrated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of predators that are so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that has increased politics as far as far. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are increasing, the inequality demand is increasing, the overall economic demand and the managing director of the Group are frightened to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism, "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the greater will be the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to put together the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">Incidentally, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't sunny good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The training of the deacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only be recovered from a miracle such as in the ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: remove the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing the low-wage employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long economy and politics separate areas, the automation can be higher, the waste substrate, and the social conflict deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reshaping the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and we consider that we will be in a disease-called hyperauto-bureaucracy which allows the film "Matrix" as a documentary film.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not, if capitalism, the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism are replaced by a Dystopia, similar to the machines in "Star Trek," or resembles those of the society into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">What would it like to do this, how could it look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to mention you, in all brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please make a capital market in which one will earn money, while you are working and in which your capital will follow you by a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "then all income from capital and income from redeemed and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who are not working there, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong to those who don't hear. no diving between capital and savings, no big gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately no means of the twin-minded peak.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies had one freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interests of the entire humankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the total world trade is traded in this currency, we call it "Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos" "and every government pay the sum of the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment is rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, in particular before the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I'll describe you is at the same time liberator, in which they preferred privileged persons and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trashmere of the history, and keynesiese, globally keynesiese.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide on political.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as the liberal marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something from what I said just is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do not do this, technological development generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry summer as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we know it, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirling.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday when dinner of the Redner have you very clearly said what you keep from the viewpoint of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large dimension of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we limited the democracy on politics, during the area where most of the economy, - the area of the economy -- a completely democracies free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense when I may tell the so provocative, China is quite similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because - remember - we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical, that affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What to observe now in China, resembles very the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now therefore refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yeah...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the self-counterfeit detection, and the persistent delay of the Eurozone fell by the euro zone, and continue to continue the development of the entire European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to decide on the basis of Greek demonstrations -- the by the way, the first proposal it was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct to make it. unfortunately, the power is elected within the euro zone, in the European group, the denied.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries an economic system, which is not viable, by political will and authority arism in life, it will perhaps be able to catch a while, yet if the change happens, he happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any fault in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously red...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in a so clamped situation, he claims not a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought that there was an honourable interest on pages of the walkers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to cause our government to fall, only because they did not deal with the contestors who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand for a catastrophic programme for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the Money, which imposed on us this policy, was revealed: "that was a colossaline error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite different per European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone in comparison to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if they do not survive, the emetzeders will be demonic forces and destroying the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences alone for Europe, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we jumped ourselves to the path of a postmodern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will be also tolerated for the future of Europeans, as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you will be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy had arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-Production of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes herself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for it, shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are located on the right side of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the average rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">They are shows like "Breaking Bad," Game of Thrones, "The Wire" -- all the shows that addictive where you have seen a season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "--" that's what you should say about this end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry to do on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on average withdrawal, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good or bad, they don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really at the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon has something makes, therefore Roy does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and selects 8 candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if you get out for free things, you don't matter what is right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of people look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed in the view of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that all receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when one starts the show when you paused, what parts you can skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 on and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- a bit above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has shown a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy it is always in search to find this a super show and he uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than to organize a competition, he and his team saw the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows of which shows you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows you like what kind of producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went to a venture, and decided to do not a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1-rating based on this curve. thus, where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent and personal data.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic came somehow, that the work should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data, for a decision one meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minest thing that can be expected, is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is a terrifying because we live in a time, in which we have more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company multi-Health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room is ever coming into contact with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the USA and asks the release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not the fact that a company like multi-Health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data diversify firms are sometimes incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict the outbreaks of flu, the worst type -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news. the success was culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It was fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work yet, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data throttest firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flows into the decisions of life, -- at the workplace, in case of legislation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics - an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions, based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, they mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you cut this problem into its components that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place you set up the single parts to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and assemble it again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For that there is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to deal with a good decision - especially if it is the brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better what they wouldn't have been able to assemble all of these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision on this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">On the other hand, on the other hand, the wrong way did.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They use data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision, because they always could say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are shooting when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget not this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic "" "" Magic 8 Ball "" "" it is amazing. for decisions by using a Jahage or No question you need only shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" highly likely "" "" -- exactly here at this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll be releasing a technique later with a technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have taken some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated means, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the fundamental body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. eventually, it is about us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I felt this as very encouraging news that, in spite of the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks going to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end there is not the data, but the risks where you meet at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
