Munich 1856 : four maps showing your views to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where people can meet young people today .
a tomb chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
we use a small gar@@ dener to the single reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich delivers exciting stories too days .
it is anno@@ ying when Land@@ cards are not current .
everyone knows that the car had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place instead of a circum@@ vent road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the geograph@@ er as Bavaria of State Government , are everything else but still very rich .
especially if you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
then it will be clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury area since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a tile carpet that can be seen as such as such .
in the large picture map , detailed maps were incorporated for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called urine leaves .
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ mination Administration council between 1810 and 1864 , resulting from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 the French forces of the Army occupied Bavaria with Austria in the spring of 1800 .
Napoleon chose an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched at the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 : it was the present neighbours that created the idea of an extensive Bayern card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian government administration .
the document sheet for Munich dates from 1856 , and is how many others on the website of the Bavarian State Library can be found .
the comparison of Early / Today is the example of the state capital by the national capital .
the town has expanded into all directions , and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
the vi@@ ctor was set up 21 years after the map of the map , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich district .
today Under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ans concentrate on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , there is nothing but fields - at the first glance : when zo@@ oming appears a smaller partial card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten book @-@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ching , &quot; which was derived from the property .
there are little plots there today , no farmers live there - but small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theresien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , at the October of October , actually still a meadow , and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical card gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ ination sheet you read in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road , people once locked people with ma@@ dness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Apostle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the au@@ spices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and finished for example the purchase of the so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has allowed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ der Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first was first place , and later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity did not attain any more - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ onic anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s in Germany .
there are now young people in Munich sal@@ es@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Ward .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and was converted into a youth home with training courses .
west is the football pitch of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children House Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ene anstalt , which was destroyed in bombing raid in the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was around 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger street &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change in the second world war was also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke off numerous holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at Marien@@ hof .
the British Institute , small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at Marien@@ hof , where these days work and will take place on April 5 , 2017 , for the second subur@@ ban railway line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
Civil Rights Publ@@ ished for Missouri
the National Union to promote color has a warning for colour people , due to the discri@@ min@@ ating policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , because a series of frag@@ ment@@ alists may occur within the entire State and listed here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes it difficult to compla@@ in compla@@ ined of discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which aim un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have any injuries of the civil rights to pass through .
they are killed because of their skin colour , they are joined or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . &quot;
it is the first warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group quoted inci@@ dents in the university of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ment@@ ality at the beginning of the year , after he was no longer v@@ ated by the state during the journey , and was taken by the police in custody without a crime .
the Council also has a recent report published by the Office of the Office of Missouri , which is shown that black people in the state will be more likely to hold 75 percent more often than the White .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Ma@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring whether to bring a deposit money or relatives , that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , it came to the year 2015 100 Hass@@ ver@@ ing , according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ sp@@ y @-@ link program of the FBI , holding the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel agreement is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residence or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Liber@@ ties Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel agency for Texas and Arizona , following the immigration authorities to pro@@ ud@@ ly the local prosecution authorities to help people who contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s list for further development .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but at the last time stak@@ eholder groups have the measure to have a response to certain laws and trends in the United States .
Wei@@ fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ f@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and is continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag to Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have created a picture in front of the site .
representatives of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his farm , in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest management , 40 dairy cows and also many young children , and also houses five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative @-@ based marketing way for him of the milk of his cows , pi@@ v@@ ot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only regional guests on the table of the holiday guests .
since he is also important at the F@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisher@@ bach , he is important to demonstrate the fence project than &quot; elementary . &quot;
I don &apos;t have th@@ inning a steep areas on such steep areas .
the green space for much work , much must be mach@@ ined with the cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed pi@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and taken care of this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead bio @-@ operation .
for may@@ ors Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
the farmers must have to be supported by 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare .
you hope that the list of surfaces of the surfaces could be moved out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and are doing thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often standing in the criti@@ que of criticism
in total , 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013 .
the reve@@ aling area is thus 40 hectares , which may not be heated up to at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted over leader , a quarter wore the commune of Fisher@@ bach .
thus the farmers stayed 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers , and land@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even for Peter White stand firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Department ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ t@@ emberg allows the state promotion of wheat fence .
the goal is the reve@@ aling of the Black Forest .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a d@@ PR @-@ drawn conveyor belt .
in addition , the un@@ fenced area must not be p@@ per@@ ed ( Han@@ gn@@ ei@@ ction above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the or@@ derer .
for the fisher@@ man project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence .
the action area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking into the Statue of Liberty
the sure sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate that as every other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s overthrow at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the suggestions of the President for dra@@ stic immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat houses and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators had acc@@ ust@@ omed to him if he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller wrote A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about story , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which enligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em which you refer to , which was later added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is . &quot;
Miller lies properly , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about story .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the r@@ ushing words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only charges any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your lab@@ ors , your poor , are free to breathe , and to breathe out free from the coasts of your coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ abor@@ ated tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
not in literary criticism - he did not make sure that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death at the base - did not know that they are complete a highly political hand .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by presenting them in a classical painting depic@@ tion the female bon@@ ding of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the object with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great carp@@ al Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a nature of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , ar@@ gued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was en@@ forced , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ doms , which will bring the american flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
she shall bear the torch of the United States in the rest of the world .
the torch shall not have the way to shine in the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ an act of Lazarus was in it , as they see from the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is about the tru@@ est sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and opportunity to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective that you want to recognize Miller and tr@@ ump ever .
her torch shall not shine on the way , but the hatred , who is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is a Scottish member of the Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ ded of a time when two s@@ ots were owned by the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to pass , until we find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with him , what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy above the street corner .
what is always the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance , whereas Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to the team capit@@ ulation .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is rather modest .
their surrender speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or practice or practice , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h brought quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles will say that it is &quot; incredibly &quot; that 16 bul@@ ls in the British squ@@ ad are .
Scotland has so far been the best total number of athletes at the World Championships seven who were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle class Mu@@ ir runs on this path and last year , five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is a further shot , one after a great season that was able to win the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first World Championships , the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ a @-@ Chap@@ ter@@ in says that she is very proud of &quot; the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special about the team of Team was in fact that it was elected by the other members of the team , so that there was a great honour to me , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes w@@ anting to ascend from Po@@ or .
what my speech is concerned as a chapter ?
yes , I think it was fine .
I have only pointed out that we are in this situation very happy because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and will simply be a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block your core through Facebook : don &apos;t block you for a public office if you don &apos;t want to heat this fr@@ ying
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the inner policy until his political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ly the criti@@ que of criticism , for sure .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vine was taken away - and , stup@@ id , and silent , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work out more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Liber@@ ties Liber@@ ties Union dis@@ gu@@ ised him about this week at the beginning of this week .
the rod of the governors left the suit as free@@ zing , and the online review was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a real heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a pri@@ m@@ owing funds to join himself with his voters and to de@@ vis@@ h@@ end his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons appearing on the side of the Board - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially recognized and from employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gan@@ s spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governors and ar@@ gued that the blo@@ cking of comments was nothing further than a present@@ er .
but it is too easy to use the picture of T@@ rolls or sp@@ ammers or water @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who are talking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a businessman , and a pastor , no movement .
they all said that their comments was respec@@ t@@ ful , th@@ ink@@ ly and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bol@@ as , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ water , but she asked to stop Hass@@ le .
&quot; I commented on that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ breaking and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news program &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I guess this idea is not when a number of people on the same topic , then they will be accepted by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the governors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , would probably be &quot; inter@@ rupt . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn or dismant@@ led newspapers with critical tra@@ ders and bring to silence and to silence .
but this is just digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants , who has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked off from his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the board of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors in Lou@@ dou@@ n County , published in Alexandria , according to the US District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , served as a vot@@ er from their fac@@ ebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Governor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multi@@ ples between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous mail writer smote his lead .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous T@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ me as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers , who made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which have critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trading and shipping of the Great Britain , have prevailed , according to historical documents created by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom , differences and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true gui@@ ding means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Re@@ fin@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Re@@ fin@@ ty will hope in the next three days of home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian held the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .

this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career , both with the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; the player said in South@@ port , the player said in South@@ port .
&quot; I don &apos;t have to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was won in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magic .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come from last year and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the back home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a bit more when you play home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel that additional pressure even though .
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid Golf .
I &apos;m glad , as it is gone . &quot;

less lung bu@@ ckets through passi@@ v@@ smoking
over the past two decades , less people are dead because of passi@@ v@@ ans of lung cancer .
at this result , scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) came to a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estim@@ ations , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoke per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up a study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time more than 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cre@@ ws were given due to passi@@ v@@ ans per year in Germany .
the new study is published at the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; .
house connectors prove itself as a very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing , and &quot; within the time , &quot; the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the location is more complicated than presum@@ ed , because there was a lot of fun in the terrain that did not notice in the plans .
traffic , which always ob@@ stru@@ cts the construction works , is a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ign@@ or@@ ance of drivers before red Amp@@ s and demol@@ ition is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the buses were allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy with the work at the bridge since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were very nice exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately we were cared for by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land

they even use rarely a saucep@@ an .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ an@@ ship in the in@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ized buttons is taken with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the mid@@ wives - she has no furniture - where she also makes her daily work , e.g. dresses with a se@@ m water from the nearby S@@ p .
a bucket in a homeless space is served as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , all of you have not been assigned to fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course , late to work may be dangerous . most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one like to go around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says she says .
it is a rare gli@@ mp@@ se of the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was accepted in 1969 by a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,0@@ 26 oldest members were to tune in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched independence against the Dutch dom@@ ination , turned aside quickly against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region , and includes foreign journalists or legal notice .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that covered the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is such a desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo and wooden compartments that were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few of Indonesia have made their journey here , there were journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before christ@@ ian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ ust@@ omed to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates on their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dar@@ ker shirt and her light rock .
&quot; previously we had only leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia of Indonesia .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed at a value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a wood resources worth about $ 78 billion .
however , this riches are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia has become a mighty military presence .
a study published in 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military agencies and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars at a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic receiv@@ ables due to greater autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been tortured , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass mur@@ dering in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s her@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1970s were forced to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ diocese of Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports on the analyses of the previous year are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as insufficient exec@@ utions and torture , rape and electric ra@@ ins are especially popular after a different report - and brutal sin@@ cer@@ ation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week demonstrations happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources present a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changed because Muslim economy will come from the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ming @-@ based cant@@ ines sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ uts served .
local people fight here to take part .
&quot; migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian president , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , was known in Volk@@ spark and Jok@@ ovo , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the rights of the Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point only two months after Jok@@ at@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the dead children said to them , that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a stum@@ bling in her tone and later came back to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hunting and beat the group with their guns , they said , victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ger@@ o , became so difficult that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young par@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military det@@ ain@@ ment centre to demand justice .
they wore veil@@ ed hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in circle running and a bird @-@ cat@@ ching - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cast stones to police and military post .
when the sen@@ timent was heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ iah Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four@@ ths of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called to rest and called for the amount to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I was turned into my left hand , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fires , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and under@@ nourished his body to ensure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I offended him . &quot;
the Che@@ dar@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , rep@@ lic@@ ate that his officers wanted to win their station only &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people were dro@@ pping to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters have been killed and many injured .
the news about the k@@ illings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jakarta .
in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech held in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims of victims and s@@ ware , to address the historic abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want the case that this case is immediately solved , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said .
safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 in order to establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the de@@ fle@@ ction of historical human rights violations .
but the expres@@ sions started almost immediately .
&quot; most trau@@ mas occurred before a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to do these clubs , but there are processes which must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he had a withdrawal , when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is defined by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , whom the UNO is accused of crimes against humanity by &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Court .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took to meet such statements with fierce accidents .
&quot; I had been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear later .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , they are afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the army sought after me , &quot; says he .
the sli@@ ps have not stopped .
on Tuesday he enjoyed the Indonesian police on vil@@ lagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ um@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , was drow@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
rising vil@@ lagers prot@@ ested against the company &apos;s office in front of the company .
the police had said that the vil@@ lagers cast stones on officers , who re@@ acted on it by warning haz@@ ard warning .
but the indigenous people say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( in@@ dones@@ ian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killing one killed .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who dwells in the vicinity of the hospital and was a witness , as the TI@@ ME was quickly available .
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon it to draw the participating officers to the account and draw the mobile Brigade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident for Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ sel@@ ess development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ emp@@ t attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ cat@@ ya .
in response to these things , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and were arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty &quot; .
some people never emerge again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just beyond the range .
people are here everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ e ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between local Pap@@ ua and new immigrants grew , which since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers have arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually going to the better trained and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary capabilities to competitive their own company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition limitations are ten@@ sion@@ ed to the coverage of international media .
at the beginning of the year , Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of the lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to you .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is suff@@ ers to raise the restrictions of coverage to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia , un@@ quiet east@@ er@@ ous provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . Visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of press control means that the international pressure remains limited to the Indonesian government to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six @-@ Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , N@@ au@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ots and the Solomon Human Rights Council on the &quot; different and far widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to forgive the evidence for human accidents . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments take this to knowledge .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , on the direction of the Human Right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura came to Auschwitz on May 4 , they broke their silence and troubled him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; to participate in the session but anon@@ ym@@ ously to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has launched another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions but it is involved from the people that are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai She@@ ets , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the president of the pedi@@ gre@@ ens .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people said that it is among the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ian military , living in im@@ pover@@ ished educ@@ t and health services .
g@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , said their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they desire only justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ per@@ sever@@ ance , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties carried out a last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was set up just over the police and the military station .
they may know that they may never come to justice , but at least let them not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a solid head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ pers of Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest housing towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that is in just two years through the high @-@ house , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , there were none to be reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were standing by the alarm alarm and the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50 th floor to the bottom , &quot; told an inhabitants whose name was George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil engineering authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ishes the fire and cooled down the buildings .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the victims .
the incident can be used to security of materials that are used in outside areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage caused by the covering , the outer cla@@ dding to decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain the police had said that the system of plates for insul@@ ating and facing at the Gren@@ ade Tower in June will have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with its large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , a proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup , was only supported on two winning sets , they are not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but even very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , was therefore missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; won &apos;t have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ con@@ ical and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ge@@ ty said . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many claims , it had already had the proposal to carry out the final on a neutral spot .
new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host to the host in the first round .
in order to reduce costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated with training places , etc . players will need to complete the official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US Travel@@ er brings forbidden items to the aircraft , finds a survey
a survey conducted among passengers carried out that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ washed objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 per cent , which led the plane , while they were acci@@ dentally forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent had claimed that they would have had delayed they had gone astray , mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the pol@@ l of more than 1,000 people - who was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ger Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers are more mis@@ erable .
of those questioned that they tried to have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , members of the X Generation X .
the most common items that were inten@@ sely populated by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have experienced objects with sound control through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were confirmed that they had brought illegal drugs in the aircraft .
the company said it was about trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ ly had caught sm@@ ug@@ ly through the airport safety and how many things have done so far .
it is no surprise that people who are most sm@@ ug@@ ly sm@@ ug@@ ly or in@@ comprehen@@ sible - caused by security , those who were most frequently .
however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are in@@ secure what liquids can bring them , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA seized physical objects .
a time long thought people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
El@@ on Mus@@ k is powered by a huge number of pre @-@ orders for its new Tesla &quot; Model 3 .
in the meantime , however , he has under@@ gone that part of the customer has already returned their obligation to the customer .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers , Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has gained moment@@ um for the first time a second , less glorious number : the cancellations made during the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 pre@@ ferences for the new car , whose extradition is just begun .
now in Mus@@ k , a total of 5@@ 18,000 pre @-@ orders have been moved back to 6@@ 3.000 times .
critics always had pointed out , that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
cancellation will be charged EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; is fully returned .
currently 45@@ 5,000 such reservations are charged , spatial mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production page .
last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 cars .
it is intended to be put together all models - 500,000 , 2020 - one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are only 1800 reservations for this purpose .
those who are appointed a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in the practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts believe that this is possible .
but if there is too much delay , then the un@@ lock of the reservations could be made for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t prevent un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ ined moves back to reduce emissions from Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ th@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , withdrew its former decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g originating from air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the way , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities compared to previous devast@@ ations .
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous position in a Federal President .
it goes around a deadline , which ran out on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of the o@@ zone o@@ zone by 2015 .
in June , P@@ ru@@ pture announced in June that he would not take observ@@ ance in order to study the plan to study more time to study the plan and to inter@@ fere in local decisions , &quot; to inter@@ fere or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ dence , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State attor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable opponent of more str@@ ingent liabilities .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ ined has been repeated to block or delayed progress or delayed by chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal return for the P@@ ru@@ g@@ ob@@ atic Roll@@ ers agenda .
last month , a Federal President in Washington decided that the EPA manager has exceeded its authority , when he tried to implement the implementation of a rule of Obama Administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane de@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his swe@@ eping ice in o@@ zone standards just hit the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; under previous devast@@ ations , the EPA often have adher@@ ed to the dead@@ lines for performing and then to be prosec@@ uted by activists and others in an agreement for the execution , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe on a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the law and the authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA announces the opinion of EPA that P@@ ru@@ ined sometime his &quot; conc@@ iliation for delay and any other legally available &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress will push on a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone of the o@@ zone .
one in the last month of approval of the bill , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years .
the intervention was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Pro@@ der@@ man , who led the US coalition led the EPA in this week , said the Group is intended to receive the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important prize for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are affected by smo@@ g , which flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cutting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems with sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases each year .
representatives of the public health estate and the environment protected by P@@ ru@@ gs surprising course change .
&quot; it is uns@@ qui@@ eter how much pressure needs to obtain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Centre for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , to defend environment users and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church it will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours at their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini highlights : &quot; it is a unique village of Bel@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle had been mentioned for the first time in the Württ@@ em@@ bür@@ g@@ oni@@ alism : the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen with his cousin Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the wording of the testimony according to the document arose at the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the parish church , also a magnificent court that belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
there are people also living there .
as seen from the description of the City Office of 1858 , next to the Lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the town picture of tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlers of the village .
old cards from time around the year 1600 were under@@ lined by these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ics was created from the early medieval y@@ line law .
one Lord , who built a church , he@@ aped out and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could not inherit this church .

association wants to test approval from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are resi@@ sts &quot; no legal prem@@ ise for the construction and has therefore turned aside to the Council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim resi@@ sts &quot; has called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ded ( CD@@ U ) , to permit its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal to be illegal .
the association insi@@ sted that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in four , a wind force concentration zone exists only .
within this concentration zone are construction and operation of wind turbines in principle possible , at the same time , the concentration zone provides a exclusion of wind @-@ use for the rest of the urban area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving of the landscape . &quot;
a few days before , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it was not approved by the Düsseldorf government in Düsseldorf , due to a formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ation , the granted approval was to be regarded as illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens back from &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current status of Things : the City Council again decided before the summer break before the summer break in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; approval from the District government stands still out .
Er@@ kens : &quot; this is the division of approval for the construction of wind turbines , legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the En@@ trance .
&quot; the corresponding letter have been passed since last week in the district four , &quot; explained a speaker .
the circle takes them on the occasion to check out the matter .
they do not result in the case that the procedure is stopped .
with view of the current procedure in the administration of the administrative court , the circle was not subject to an agreement with the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &apos;s arguments . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build up four @-@ metre high wind turbines .
already last year , the company was involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen , in which the town of Vier@@ sen , was closed , with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all four@@ fold households .
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , there were green@@ ish light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

tr@@ ump placed after transparent tran@@ scripts from telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned border .
the US President imp@@ anz@@ ee him , because he publicly denied the wall . according to reports he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first recru@@ itment with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull were also released and revealed to an un@@ treated exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the trade , which was conve@@ yed by the government Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said to Mr. Turn@@ Bull , &quot; that is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ar@@ ists : milit@@ ar@@ act Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ f@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man @-@ middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ screen .
inside the inside , the occup@@ ants settled in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn in silence , when a young black man was crushed from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this awesome scene was played , which was played on July 22 , only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a trap will be thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , almost everyone in the audience threw very real gro@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ chi as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were bor@@ dered by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted for the murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ complete that in all these years not only one person was arrested - although we know them to see who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Bro@@ oks that helps in the organization &apos;s organisation .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of Georgia and for a lifetime of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for acting and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that was never corrected .
&quot; we want the prosecution , we want the termination , we want to cure healing , we want to make atonement , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to Healing and Re@@ conc@@ iliation , until we obtain justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction creates a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI file , received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding landscape were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizen timely , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice , Georgia made a vote for the first time in Georgia to vote their vote in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s black Far@@ mers Roger Mal@@ col@@ m , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that the rum@@ our of the city had been that h@@ test@@ ers with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby was wearing her , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they went away from prison , the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it show@@ cases , it was Har@@ rison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , evidence removed and conce@@ de the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it more enjoyable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a elec@@ toral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register , and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
in almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene managed the yearly reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is more detailed , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look and still more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confron@@ ted with his her@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can not build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or listen to what I do through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and listen , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is an old co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of boss c@@ lan@@ mit@@ es for years , but he said that the role would never get easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story on life because we would not like to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room tests the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , playing Roger Mal@@ col@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ com , the test@@ ers , and troubled him , to sleep with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , get away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ ect the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) are a der@@ ision .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the bottom .
&quot; what ? ! ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona again asked about him .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still , si@@ di@@ zed .
&quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people at that time were &quot; n --- he &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ching one of the other black per@@ formers .
&quot; you only must meet the harsh &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly as the energy produces in the room , a feeling of camera charges replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once again .
this time when Ras@@ cona say the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends for@@ ci@@ bly and quickly .
there are carp@@ ie , nuts and then silence .
a woman clothed with a fun@@ eral dress is above the dead bodies of the actors and leads Billi@@ ons Holidays Ab@@ ern@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught silence and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a pair from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as ma@@ gi@@ ous moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the Mor@@ de had left an A@@ ne@@ k@@ d@@ ote , but now when the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feel felt at the same time .
when the last notes of the songs came out , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and in@@ spect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and fl@@ aming one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , than he will remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x , and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w is surrounded by Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , which played the sound member .
Nick Ras@@ cona is two of his fellow players , and then breaks into their arms weeping , and the emotional burden of the performance did eventually pass through him .
&quot; it is okay , fl@@ aming one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that from a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets together with the actors for dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated a white pair , stim@@ ulated about the reproduction with a black pair , which they &apos;ve just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear this terrible words and deeds ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me , can believe that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , T@@ yr@@ one Bro@@ oks stood at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , since it describes the fear of what we bear , but it is a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so , if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
he who does not have his own story , who does not know his own story , is to be condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ th@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconciled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf has reli@@ ed on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging prior to gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the Stage Platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) , shows an attached street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo of GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
prior to this , an open Mercedes @-@ ol@@ d@@ timer , where the R@@ he@@ aters will get a rock , or an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ap@@ o@@ gens remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs head motiv@@ ating - money , power and gre@@ ed - that is moving through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three banks - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ang@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - Harmon@@ izer is wonderful as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the magnificent fi@@ dd@@ ler in Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ thing box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , as he sm@@ iled as Siegfried .
later there must also believe in Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) .
the audience ow@@ es the ensemble with stronger appl@@ ause .
on the stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , de@@ pressed a humble and hands on the Merkel @-@ smo@@ kers .
great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in le@@ agues .
the presence of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ i@@ et@@ eam had been expected in tension .
in 2013 , he still had to leave a great whi@@ st@@ worthy Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto in 2013 , there were five years later big jew@@ ish in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; -@@ Ru@@ fe left .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; notice the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ pe@@ at but it is also an understanding of its visibility .
I will draw a positive conclusion .
Max quantity works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in stone furt in the furniture train , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with young adults , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late @-@ employed volunteers .
how does it come ?
amount : I made high school Abitur .
and then a engineering graduate studies , we say that we stopped and successfully canc@@ eled .
I know for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , with people .
and then I asked me what you &apos;re doing .
make a social year since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social care winter semester .
I will come with dual platform , probably do in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different fields of work during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes it is very variable .
it always comes on it where you will be the FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the age to youth work - in all possible fac@@ tions of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the middle , so in the afternoon care .
that was exactly the right thing for me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it &apos;s not about to estimate stand out .
one has always got other people in front of them , each having a very different story behind themselves .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been out@@ dated out of the family - one must always go on it .
very interesting .
and you had no touching ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .

in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA announced the O@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be fixed , where sections must be taken to clari@@ fy , in order to delayed air quality standards - by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a law@@ suit and said that the effort is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump is trying to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental reasons that the former president Barack Obama has imposed , as a part of a wider agenda that would stim@@ ulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have caused the impact of the Democrats and protection groups , wor@@ ried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms such as as@@ thma .
Municipal Council wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : at two oppos@@ ites , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ te @-@ Win@@ S@@ old decides the establishment of a community hall in the future dwelling residential community .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic part is signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
indeed , until the date of the church community is still going to be owned by the church community , but there is now no plan for planning to come from a private invest@@ or to st@@ em@@ ate project more .
for this there is a discussion about a community room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters surface for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council aims to show such a common room only as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ just living space , but open to the church .
as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
in case of funding , the decision made by the provision of means for the ongoing budget has been pre @-@ decided in the previous fall by funding .
the construction is located in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a common room was , so T@@ j@@ aden reported , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
by means of a decision to indicate that no b@@ ill@@ ets between legs must be determined in this regard that both the arti@@ cul@@ ated p@@ itting - what is reduced to the environmental protection - as well as p@@ ent roof - which makes the height of economic power - as well as possible .
un@@ necessarily , it is not just Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : it unanimously happens the board .
it is not that simple to the common room .
Daniela Call for the many own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t come so on , but with the common room of the window , she says : &quot; I do it difficult to do so . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger talks to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it with a maximinum payout of oh@@ am@@ pling or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give an allowance , but can get a real , in doubt in case of doubt , the counter is counter@@ ing .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s motion to apply accordingly to the decision of the decision shall find three fears .
so it remains with two counter @-@ counter at the original program , which summar@@ izes the resolution of Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is lit on road

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
the last time was not good . &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official time of the season .

in the resin of Stern , hiking
in the Harz mountains , the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created .
this is planning the Club Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there have been a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ ry ad &quot; come to meet the information of many har@@ z@@ lovers , it was named .
it binding nature , science , motion and sporting power .
the members want to set out along the planned route boards and inform them above stars and star images .
during the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning well @-@ reaching installations to five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries made from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hohe@@ ge@@ iß and si@@ eve .
the information on boards should be supplemented by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception is playing a part of the location selection .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ board train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ board experience the viewer experience much knowledge , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it is far away far away .
also , in which constellation is a chosen star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , situated in the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the national park consists of information on the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often there are from the dairy road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy to be seen clearly with naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ City , since 2003 , there has been an initiative of the sponsor@@ ing Plan@@ et@@ arium with a little simil@@ ar@@ ities as the planned star @-@ house - the planet &apos;s planet .
beginning before Geb@@ a hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet road leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( municipality of Equ@@ al ) with the Plan@@ Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ables with the single planets - including the d@@ warf planet Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk thus on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures 75 meters away , while the sun measures 70 centimetres .
the total distance from the planet level is over four kilometres .
while the light of Sun up to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus wal@@ kers are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would take a half a year .

&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Garcia .
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I would like to download the weight of light .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
this would demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted in .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate change asked whether it should be at pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that &apos;s Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , who also strug@@ gles to agree to the battle against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight champion in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this struggle could take place at the pay @-@ by @-@ View Mode because all fans have asked after him , &quot; said Garcia and pressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no other struggle manages so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work , &quot; said Garcia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I waited on the top fighter and that &apos;s Mi@@ key .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions according to tire bur@@ gers
on Thursday , four persons were injured as part of an accident on the A7 .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the connecting station at 16.@@ 30 shortly before the connecting station , probably following a tire bur@@ zer .
the car s@@ war@@ med to the right into the vil@@ er , where he remained over and then remained on the roof of the ridge .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the last by the rescue service , the A7 towards the north was locked in direction north for about one hour , then the traffic could be buried on the left strip of the accident at the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; three dimensional chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 to the end of the season open@@ er , that the optimization of def@@ ensive information will bring in Au@@ e points .
the first season was Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result also , since the two opponents were not in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the triangle will also be optimised further in the Ore Mountains .
and one gate after a fre@@ t , the Fort@@ y will not be able to capture even more .
&quot; there will be such a way for the future that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also comes better after the experience in preparation with the spin @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are working in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Radio , but Hoffmann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we are just in the triangle chain at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can rely on it , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not work in the construction as many gam@@ bl@@ ers . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will also travel to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether one cannot speak after a failed start of a sl@@ ump start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could really be okay , &quot; says Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be talking of an ordinary season open@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted nothing to know about it .
&quot; the start into the season I only after six to eight game days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Radio , who does not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be stopped in the home due to a temp@@ est .
&quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that players from Au@@ e may possibly even be a bit fresh , as they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ension into the bones . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner man of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests come from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( nearly ) finished Stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have left them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , the ble@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance in only one defeat against au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to hit from vor@@ n@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and arro@@ gan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his player on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Review 2014 Publ@@ ished
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( hard se@@ mit@@ es ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
in the case of an asylum application , you will have more detail on the assessment of age , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ational ) failed because of errors at the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , migration of 6,@@ 880 is sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests in the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency was judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is asked .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant in the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see great difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over the age of 18 , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers should be weighed over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that we suggest that the person concerned 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper s@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det released the 5@@ 81 findings , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said openly that they would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical assessment assessment , which are made of sound levels and MRI images of knee @-@ joints , which are analyzed then criti@@ ci@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was criti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ eman Institute , whose work covers the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they so@@ oner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot tell it , we should not do so as if we could say it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson is defended by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you may say that the risk of developing a child is un@@ correct as an adult .
the greatest risk of risk if the person is less than 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully operational in the plan
work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed at the east entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of Stre@@ ming and Transport at the Department of Transport and Transport at the Freiburg Department .
in April , the work began at the same time at all three fine @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete that is glu@@ ed with red b@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
in the meantime , like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red B@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ bach on the north side .
this is an edge version that is also used as operating instructions .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path should go away .
the particular thing is that it is a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ner .
a special finger@@ tips has the adjustment of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed of the work by hand @-@ handed over the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be removed .
for the bridges between the building and the collecting of Sch@@ ram@@ berg in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is traffic on traffic light by a traffic light .
the road on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher village is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; fully locked .
the costs for the three Br@@ ück@@ ent@@ ations amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under Prot@@ est in German potato sal@@ at
it is not so frequent that parties go to a strand , but when it goes around the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring on a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance which indicates that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites for a poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the general election on 24 September , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the event in front of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ak , but will demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pick@@ ni@@ ck was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well &apos;s well , but will now take place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who arrive at the Af@@ eng@@ thalle in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the For@@ ums One World and one of the relevant organizers , really happy : &quot; great how many people have joined here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food including a &quot; German potato sal@@ at that could not eat the Af@@ s@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him back .
the police has many customs officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it is present in presence , above all , at the station that is just a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Mand@@ d volcanic erup@@ ts reported that he has been trying to get an event and an extra charge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially returned in Dau@@ n , but there will be a cancellation , because due to the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us church there is not enough parking available .
well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , the main matter , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this is also doing : at 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ev@@ an D @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the top channel in the general election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their spe@@ eches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
somewhat more than one hour the Af@@ D event takes you to enjoy a longer breath , but also there &apos;s a time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can g@@ aps - no special inci@@ dents .
trumpet hits trumpet
a return to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ n@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there is a series of Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , there is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in bli@@ ster music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international competitions and have a soloist in European peak orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ o@@ aun@@ er &apos;s SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the desire to pass not only the limits on their instruments , but also to melt the borders of the various gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jaz@@ e@@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ itt , mix well as classical jazz , jazz and free games at a fascinating array of art .
this key piece of the program was premiered in Freiburg &apos;s early spring with special success .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ itt was writing specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with their special acou@@ stics will be aware of the concert .
Cri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart has quite openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; when I remember once in gr@@ illed cheese I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what happens next ? &apos; .
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was the &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson who finally went away from bitter .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette performer facing the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; Magazine : &quot; I was in any serious love which I have changed .
or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten to prove that they are bis@@ exual , &quot; I have always lived and believed in the du@@ alism .
it has never been confused or disabled me .
I &apos;ve never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially under &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time they prefer to dress as a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this has really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bush .
I really felt attacked , dist@@ ressed and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I gaz@@ ing back and think myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially to the public , they don &apos;t like to live her love : &quot; people expect you to have a certain sort and the anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some more than an ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like it to just@@ ify myself before the entire public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced the Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have taken away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will not help you as a inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that at the time there is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .

For@@ bes is the fact that he has dispos@@ es of coal plants in five states , and created by his father a carbon store .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would be more likely to work in order to make our country magnificent . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative body in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last ref@@ usal of a party that is not able to find a positive , reasonably satisfied message , &quot; the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel spoke in a statement den C@@ BS news .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; Russian validation for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world @-@ wide chef of Athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised as offensive from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment of the country to be resum@@ ed again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s Athlet@@ ics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ la@@ k@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships at the eve of the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes born in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) evidence on state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honour@@ able presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ ters .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was pleased to know that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that it has experienced some hot times , and can do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ formed . &quot;
Co@@ e said it is too &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctive day , and I think it was achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF @-@ criteria .
the leaders of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re@@ setting .
threat@@ ening tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden Trainer are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
trau@@ ar@@ act for Mali sho@@ re@@ ed in Mali
with a fun@@ eral service in the north h@@ ess@@ ian Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1000 people have thought of the two on a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security checks .
in addition to un@@ explained , the Minister of Defense Minister , Ursula in the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
they called the two kind of commented pilots but as the &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they declared in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday prior to a week in West African Mali .
her reb@@ ate were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total Commander of the Armed Forces in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ k cathedral St. Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of family , close friends , representatives of the army and politics .
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the p@@ enn@@ ess laid down lil@@ ies , the relatives got arm in arms to the S@@ är@@ gen .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ k and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen was decorated as a &quot; highly decorated &quot; and embar@@ r@@ ed .
the Chief of St@@ ub@@ mann has built the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar , and be one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ x , commander of the reg@@ im@@ ents , declared to whom the soldiers were , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , there would have been none of them . &quot;
in doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not appear : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , whereof we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the S@@ är@@ ge was brought out of the cathedral .

Prince Hen@@ rik wants to see a tomb next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried on his wife next to his wife .
this divided the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish que@@ aar is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g@@ us for the two .
the Queen was with the decision of their husband , and named it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intent to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a dog out of that he was not happy with his title .
after his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king .
in 2016 he retired and lays down the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself not as an equivalent , not even after death , LE@@ NE Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish king &apos;s parliament .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be , still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his future wife , the sympath@@ y of the people always flew to , Prince Hen@@ rik had a major booth in his almost 50 @-@ year reg@@ imes with the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography E@@ rik ruled Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap opera instead of kn@@ it so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ls , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ Tab@@ ak and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ ally intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
they were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government , the Prime Minister Stephan Weil passed away after the loss of the red @-@ green government for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising leaving of a Green @-@ dep@@ uties in Lower Saxony had overthrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green Coalition lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ west has established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in Rot@@ enburg in its elec@@ toral circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hannover .
CD@@ U @-@ Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group .
this means CD@@ U and F@@ DP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether they could keep in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , holds it for un@@ profitable , that the country &apos;s day quickly decides quickly his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further anticip@@ ation on Tuesday .
the country code also provides the possibility that the Land@@ mark of the Prime Minister shall withdraw the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options have to be checked by legally , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be in rest all the questions , if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the name of the West Step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself said : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ ul@@ ter@@ ni@@ ge dep@@ uties for the return of their country session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course taken out of course that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ n@@ at that she has resigned from the green national list with immediate effect , &quot; distributed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the honorary chairman of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regre@@ tt@@ p@@ iti@@ ed the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to guide no language in the Group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot;
SPD pul@@ pit candidate Martin Schulz gives the over@@ lap of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the Beh@@ avi@@ or of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; the Federal Government of Social Democrats took on Facebook on Facebook .
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , which will quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ o @-@ western airport will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
the politi@@ cian in her very last erup@@ tion and in her Fr@@ ust her personal interests in front of the state of the country , &quot; criti@@ ci@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes CD@@ U in Lower Saxony this dirty in@@ tri@@ umph@@ al game , tried to beat the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U Fra@@ ction Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its dep@@ uties , El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U .

at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ne in the Land@@ tag but a hau@@ gh@@ ty majority of a vote .
the agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect against Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about blin@@ ded eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editing network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer be po@@ is@@ oned from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I only encourage all consumers and consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
the federal states are available on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states each of the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , we know , a health risk is practically impossible .
assumes Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer because the central role of the insur@@ rection by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been informed immediately and has been in the close exchange of Germany &apos;s close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to the consumer .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are transport and health are un@@ question@@ able .
if in the eggs of the return height of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time they are not allowed to bl@@ ame .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production companies do not meet immediate fault .
in fact , due to the alleged illegal practices of services , they need to calculate economic damages .
as always there are too little controllers in the harvest .
is there only a staff or about the sle@@ dge jurisdiction ?
however , it was just the official controls that have revealed the operation .
however , the truth belongs to that food and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 percent .
for this reason , a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and hand@@ over of the communities in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be given , of decisive importance .
I had already made several times , that by the responsible authorities , I expect a complete statement by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm noise when food store is really necessary ?
consumer consumers have the right to receive exclusively secure and viable foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in food industry , consumer goods and consumers were destroyed .
by the ar@@ ched means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds fi@@ dd@@ il in the attitude of living animals is not acceptable and has to be terminated immediately .
it must be resol@@ utely consistently and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I am a@@ waiting of all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact is clari@@ fied and un@@ explained .
how does the finance rules of the ball on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of the European soccer football , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not distur@@ b .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain des UEFA EURO because the executive organisation , which monitors the European game has power to offer teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
the financial fair play @-@ Play rules that were launched by the UEFA Cup in 2011 must mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars moved to France .
PS@@ G can quickly make the money to loose , that N@@ ey@@ mar is writing down and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
to apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must control even with legitim@@ ate sources of acceptance , which allow them to make the break @-@ even point in their on football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs in their quest after success had enormous debt , effectively deceit@@ ful and ris@@ ked to ruin , if banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P fell from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel G@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand - to a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can reach losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini in 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ i continues to qu@@ en@@ rol , of exc@@ essive issues .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will enhance the rules of the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA Cup last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , making the redemption for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the German @-@ based members of the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players in the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to list their financial statements by companies that are connected to the owners of a club , which are puff@@ ed up with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company would sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA EURO would not apply as a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA Trial Chamber decided that the number of Spon@@ sor@@ ship &apos;s value has been presented by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar will be coming to Qatar from the World Cup Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 were cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will be trying to find out any kind of maneu@@ vers for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA EURO will still listen to listen to any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEFA Cup had no pre@@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Transfer , which are familiar to people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports showed that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the association assumes that sales after the signing will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Weg@@ ener that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a cle@@ arer case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish paper AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s local owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ mer@@ W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La Liga against a state that has financed a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of the ball in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gil@@ vy
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been established for the Swiss world .
now the s@@ itt@@ ings in front of a possible end : the airline writes the job new .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA , a corresponding report of the newspaper Nord@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged boards spread to 14 grams a year before landing at the passengers .
at the cost , Swiss didn &apos;t want to make any information .
industry In@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effect : for a ch@@ og@@ y manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
how many applications do it take on the new call , the Swiss will not be betrayed .
but only Swiss producers come in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate boards distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss Life completed a contract with a mig@@ rant daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ builds together with Hu@@ g the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the possibility to place the logo led to Swiss before two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers together .

N@@ ost@@ al@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repe@@ ating history is a nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old daughter comedy , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , as Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went into greater things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ facts , it is equally an par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era , permanent memories .
but when fran@@ chise feels it , the time would be close .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly good , not only because of its absur@@ d Hum@@ ans ( it contained a original history for a speaking can of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by playing on the nucle@@ us of the g@@ ain@@ ee with an actor to play middle ages , children who grow up - they managed to win the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the w@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who are now playing less emotional roots and his par@@ ody goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand who gaz@@ es the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
one point is a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a series of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ador@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ case ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
there is another crazy plot , where Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ case ) is involved , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the lessons are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes lots of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ alli@@ on Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ art of &quot; singles &quot; showing a former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy has now feels like a old bu@@ acker .
these are the moments of acci@@ dental win@@ dow@@ ns that could heat this fran@@ ce as a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I mean as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : the last scene will show the band , how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gic : on the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ west ring I@@ con@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main rollers - a hard cra@@ ving Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ ist Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tracks for watching ( the police p@@ ush@@ es the time to watch chess in television as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous speaker - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desp@@ air@@ prop@@ aganda drama - a murderer , which carries a Re@@ agan mask , is that it often plays as a single one .
there is a lot of episodes at six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast , or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was pointed out to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re could always be able to visit American message , whose lobby can always be occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian cre@@ ators are not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ ood .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police was a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ ist , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects had passed through , like the public prosecutor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday .
we have been arrested for 15 years between the ages of 25 and 77 and issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials introduced major amounts of Mar@@ ih@@ u@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arm , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Ital@@ ians gave the arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore to be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the promotion , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia is accused of a drug ad@@ diction , attempted murder , attempted murder , as well as a prey and stress .
as summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office is established in Constance against the organised drug traff@@ icking in the South German space .
between the students in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ator of Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the big deployment was accompanied on Wednesday tomorrow also by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , Italian nationals re@@ juven@@ ate the Italian nationality with respect to Italian Maf@@ ia .
even a incident on 27 May in hips in the morning , several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , should go on to the account of the gang .

the lead to some serious failure in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the se@@ al@@ way of associations .
short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could result in case of asylum procedures and shifts , &quot; in part of an analysis that occurred in the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the Register , 10 million people are enrolled in foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
data is therefore managed by some 600 exclusion agencies in Germany .
because data has not been sufficiently maintained , whether the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer on life , or of citizens who are a German citizen or should not appear anymore in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data reports may considerably slow@@ down . &quot; it is , according to its report .
in the statistics , about foreigners interests are caused by EU citizens that would not have to travel .
but such acts of wrong orders led to a distor@@ ted debate on the use of reconciliation with extin@@ ction , &quot; says it in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government has already begun to return the refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Jersey newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is therefore that B@@ AM@@ F will lead such procedures for families with children - except for babies and infants - from Italy since 1 June 2017 .
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
the Dublin Convention is responsible for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the EU State at first , in order to reach them first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it into the country .
for the grounds write the office now : &quot; in the meantime the recording capacity for families with minor children increased substantially in Italy . &quot;
Italy asked for the recording and accommodation of families guarantee .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) hold these applications for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin &apos;s Dublin war@@ fare .
the internal political speaker in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children above had un@@ lawful for the defects in the Italian Asyl@@ um System of Human Rights and a danger of child . &quot;
to achieve the second best result
a total of 220 litres of blood from the Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach &apos;s people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least one of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile sold 50 litres of blood now .
traditionally , the community commen@@ ds several times of read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood in the session of the Council .
&quot; it is awesome as our body is laid for it and we have respect to the sp@@ ies that their blood are available for strangers , still un@@ profitable , &quot; under@@ lined may@@ ors of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; explained the model of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are distor@@ ted into their components .
for example , three persons could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K sp@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the change to the theater house has led to higher participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ berry were awarded to multiple sclerosis and have received a don@@ ate for 50 .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the slow@@ down of inflation have been subdued on a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to stay , as they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger print .
the policy @-@ makers of the Social Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank voted to hold up to 0.25 % , with less members of increasing interest in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , and that the pressure should continue to rise to domestic income , while inflation in autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest rate would be necessary to ch@@ okes the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ ite and said that the loan cost may be more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was issued a year ago after the breaking of Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will be time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial funding for banks over the coming February , although it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the MP@@ C the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the real income of households will still be charged to the consumption . &quot;
the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain penalty of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; degree would be required when the markets expect .
the markets now predicted its first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank has stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank revised upwards below revised growth forecast for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound was after this news about the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
no change comes to no change , after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rates have subdued rising expectations and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly to recover from the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a lot of enthusiasm for households which will be affected by increasing inflation and slight sal@@ aries , as the disappearance is worse before being repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that the monetary policy could not prevent the income before him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year period will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated for a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is made a year after lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pit .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last verdict of the Bank to the interest rates , the call increased after a interest rate because inflation increased the pressure on tough households , with three political decision makers in July would demanded an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation in the past month decreased from 2.9 % to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank predicted that this was expected again in the next few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aims at their goal is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn to the weak P@@ ound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest decline of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive more competitive as the credit line would like to search for shops and end the year in positive way .
the market is particularly well suited for those with which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ gage will close , and many with the toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is aimed at str@@ ating HIV drug thre@@ ats 10,000 people .
patients will receive access to a &quot; transformation &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ eration treatment after a fight against financing of the drug in the N@@ HS in September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded in front of sexual intercourse ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk factors by around 86 percent , now a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people is delivered .
he prepared himself to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al had confirmed the Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pre@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess player announced on Thursday was sent by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; an important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to be the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ defined ph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ on@@ EP was significantly reduced the HIV transmission in the risk of infections .
pr@@ one before sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come into question for the treatment , pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified , who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who are living in England and registered at a domestic veter@@ in@@ arian are also able to register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program is expected to invest £ 10 million and N@@ HS England a contract for the delivery of medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study should assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by implementing clinical documents , as it is implemented in a large scale , is implemented and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevention of HIV and over@@ take it .
it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing adv@@ ancement in developing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to needy and endangered people , the ability to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not subject to a consultation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome you very warm this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie on it , that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one that has a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was introduced , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Sha@@ dows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to the government after months of delay and hes@@ itation .
the evidence showing how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transmission of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to the completion of the dissemin@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and smart designer tricks this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment turned into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker in a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne &apos;s terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed her bags and sold it .
&quot; I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sought something similar to my price .
I had shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I love them in love and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a single bedroom estate with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she asked Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to ut@@ ilize 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
the fan had to think to solve the provision .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were stacked on each other without having to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just about to build a simple platform , but to set the steel that it had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement , Er@@ fan allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down to the most gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights put the style to the program .
the use of mirrors plays an important role in adding theat@@ res , space and light .
at both ends it is a short corridor to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the spi@@ der feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units can accommodate all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
thanks to perception of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can be close to the kitchen if they are not used .
folded kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing in this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineers went into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very important to slide , so when you slide the door , it is very easy to gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or like your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate of real estate will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the ground floor and use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch , and they are helping to create an emotional bond within a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed through a good design and increased square meter of a somewhat default in something special .
in fact , such as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them .
brothers compete for a 500 million US dollar property empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation due to one of the biggest real estate imper@@ me@@ an Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and Develop@@ er Colin De Lut@@ is lived in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy , as their property and its business assets shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers said 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , in 1973 .
there I founded the West@@ co Je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , developing areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - von Paul has been described as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the business and Paul is about one @-@ third .
a judicial review says that Colin property has property of EUR 316 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a sound point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Colin made it left with him what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial monkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers are strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - including Colin , how Paul claimed to be excluded .
Colin did not ar@@ gued that this is not true , but he th@@ rows Paul before , to manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Colin he would hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost is in case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails , and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of held law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ 2 years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they took the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ egen@@ etics , which opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family in Colin .
Colin he says that he began to serve West Africa in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before the court , &quot; she wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is Group , where Colin claimed that Mark was paid at the company &apos;s $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St. Luke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; on the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made herself back very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member , and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and whose lawyers get in touch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to tell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very sad , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin made a letter to the court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have rolled that Paul and I would like to end in our current war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he and added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was still in a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of dishes , &quot; says Colin .
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media value of the President .
others have tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
politi@@ co reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a constant course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first day of working with executive employee , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps white house which he rep@@ airing with wool : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letter - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to count tr@@ ump by taking over his media law .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relation to television is back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV shows still heavily .
&quot; if the Tr@@ ump was denied because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was given a fair coverage of places which were to convince , &quot; said the former vot@@ er pilot consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to politi@@ co .
politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaigns in this purpose , ensure that his personal media sum includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this struggle officials know something , what we don &apos;t know other - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could have not contain any more ignition types without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never know something about the Twe@@ ets that has not sent tr@@ ump .
when his co @-@ workers made it a number of times , stum@@ bling by him , their efforts have worth it .
but no one has consistently avoi@@ ding that tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y calls .
a part of the problem consists of that people in a white house , which are strug@@ gling from competing parties to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world .
politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , to support the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example of the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker was described :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump is how a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he would find out to find out from whence they come from .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone offered a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a heap at his Lec@@ cos &apos; in the White House .
although Johnson had been banned permanently from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has sold wrong alle@@ g@@ ations in the past .
tr@@ ump read the article and began to question people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to implement and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same Kelly three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his pulse self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still seeking influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ er searched crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
this summer , the police were shipped all over Europe during this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested sever@@ ity are not known , references from the population are hop@@ ed and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU must &quot; Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent Calendar of winter .
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile holidays in vacation rentals , it was named Euro@@ pole .
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online request could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ th row &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands come back with some resol@@ ute passengers on war base , which have issued one of the bor@@ ro@@ asted dit@@ ch , to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ th row . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orting , after they were pulled out only in May , without dis@@ covering from the Council out of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ full group found a gap in the defense of defense and pressed their vehicles by a section called un@@ disabled , to find a way .
un@@ expect@@ edly residents have tried the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; You went there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am to implement the problem when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May , where we moved and are back again .
more arrived in the evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , to protect your parks to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ am@@ mad Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my members if the Council can stop this . &quot;
a local people who would not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last lap of this trav@@ ellers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible .
in order to support our help collection , it is very important that as many people as an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct can call on police by calling 101 by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we submit our case . &quot;
coming from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is called Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , the then ambi@@ ance of the hotel mbH about 30 000 nights per year were lost per year and also revenues by local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic rise from refugees that came into the County , the hotel building houses the property , as a collective accommodation , was offered for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the preparation of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all the Freuden@@ stadt leader Julian Oss@@ et@@ wald defended the hotel site and said then at the time of ern@@ st@@ aging interested persons at the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it again to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
they are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , a longer period of buildings have been installed in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear how extensive renovation work will be made .
the so@@ ils were torn out , the ceilings were dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large covered showers , the input range is converted , new window will be installed .
all should be really called &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , just like Thomas Sch@@ erer turns out .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , yet at a higher levels of the city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its roughly 60 rooms , will be given a wide selection of sc@@ iss@@ ors .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause have already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the City &apos;s performance shows are equal with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set up exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the out@@ plants are also brought to front of the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace that is open to the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special En@@ dur@@ ations reli@@ es on Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
in the past few weeks , the committee started work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; signed up with the cause of the people .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded his investigations to intensi@@ fy its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first efforts of Gre@@ cian in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps El@@ test@@ i@@ Son and a Russian lawyer .
US Intelligence accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been mixed up in 2016 , targeted by the presidential election in 2016 .
in Mu@@ eller , Mu@@ eller examined whether there were different from Tr@@ um@@ ps Ele@@ ction Team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigation , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Repub@@ lic@@ ers .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
the Washington Post , wrote some weeks ago that the special no@@ blem@@ an Tr@@ ump entered into the center and under@@ gone a throw @-@ off , whether the president could han@@ dic@@ apped justice in the course of the affair .
the main assignment of Grand Law@@ ys is to check out and decide whether the charge is to be raised .
in the Grand Jur@@ ys , the Prosec@@ ution also are also called .
most of mostly they are switched on when it is greater and controversial cases .
the procedure shall always be closed behind the closed doors .
in addition , the board can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to download persons under an oath .
according to CN@@ N broad@@ caster has already been issued prior to turn , turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called to a testimony , called it in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and mother @-@ in law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts told us on Thursday evening in the US television that the entry show that Mu@@ eller will not leave in his work and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it must not be noted that the Grand Jury will be switched on to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nonetheless , the objective of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President of the Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else about which they can talk . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a memor@@ andum , it is nothing from the entry of a Grand Jury .
but it is usually work in sal@@ ut@@ ants , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special medium in &quot; f@@ aire &quot; mode .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that the president will not be determined against the president .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed since it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after tr@@ ump com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ro@@ oting , demonstrations against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he would not inter@@ fere with justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him an attitude of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President stands under a large pressure for the examination .
according to representation of US media , the White House gathered material against special events and his staff .
that led to the spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent special author@@ ization of Congress such as Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has rejected a position in which he could be fired upon in theory of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators exhibited in the Thursday of the legisl@@ ature , after which the special no@@ ises could not be released so easy .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg dri@@ es in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Arctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg is solved by the scar@@ ce of the barely seven times of Berlin .
this was divided by the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss now cast down to the north and will probably need two , three years until it was melted .
it is a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ic@@ e@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
in what climate change has played a role in the bur@@ gl@@ ary of ice cream , it is un@@ clear according to research information .
in total , there have been a series of unusual mer@@ ging in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact .
according to many researchers , it could be associated with global warming .
the broken piston was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
thus it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America close to the fore@@ front of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this gravel pit was the balance of wax and dis@@ rup@@ tions a few years ago .
a complete sl@@ um@@ fe@@ is to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is at risk , because the front edge has never been withdrawn , as at present .
in addition , the iron plate rise under tension and could be broken down , if a piece of a key is at a place .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water swimming and ice cream as much water as it gives the melting itself .
however , the loss of the shaft leads to that the glacier goes directly to the sea and much faster than before .
this could eventually increase the sea level , but only in a small size , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
with almost 50 000 square kilometers , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest park of Antar@@ cti@@ ca .
the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , along the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and we have no direct link to climate change , the ice plate now comes in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now come back or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher did not lead the heav@@ al of this gigantic ice vineyard to climate change , so in the past decades very many sk@@ el@@ ks of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are broken down .
this long ascent of the Antar@@ ctic is in the direction South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers in the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have spent about three degrees in the past 50 years , with it in the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to become hood with staff
because it is getting more difficult , freely advert@@ ised places , calls for the CD@@ U to leave the employer &apos;s employer to be more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the delivery date has 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
even 17 trainees have left their first working day behind themselves .
the course in the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications were to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , there &apos;s lack of staff , in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are currently no occupied places in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to join the initiative in the C@@ DP and the U@@ WG with the An@@ DP and the U@@ WG on the initiative of the T@@ DP and D@@ WG .
according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel and personnel development work . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions for professionals , but also the future of the applicant can counter@@ act it .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself to inside and outside , specific measures for trans@@ verse clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already a good approach to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems , which you did not know earlier .
other cities waste good public officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the talk is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by the service comes out of the service .
thus , the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , Chairman of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the common application with his party .
he had already been a surprise for a f@@ b@@ ating thickness in the course of chal@@ k , as he put in question the personnel cost coverage and blo@@ cking the rest of the parties .
people wants to check all the options that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not reach a satisfactory solution for a satisfactory solution , the county government should also strive together with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to pay attention to the CD@@ U , the employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money there is only if one changes into a higher level that is based on professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are still growing over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the terms of the new Pro@@ st@@ itu@@ ency Protection Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Cir@@ cular Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound of NGOs worldwide .
Italy has warned about the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue the new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat to the German relief organization &apos; youth R@@ ügen &apos; because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way which facilit@@ ated illegal emig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to sell the Italian Staats@@ an@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ onist Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ o .
&quot; for us and remains the salvation of human lives our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can do not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a memor@@ andum on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all alle@@ g@@ ations that are currently collected , after we collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ained &apos; , monitored by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew was taken on board migrants who will be delivered directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposedly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , its content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the lif@@ eb@@ rates in the Zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats must be on board as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors its activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue approaches have so far explained to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but acceptable to be no &quot; essential amendments or Dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates , physicians , Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti now stated that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , had strongly decreased in the last weeks to strengthen the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s Coast Guard and the collaboration with local citizens .
&quot; we began to see light at the end of the tunnels , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan civil initiatives in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali , on the reduction of the number of migrants attemp@@ ting to reach these countries within the hope .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine w@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in juni@@ enheim in the North Sea salt to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ s@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and hamlet of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of St. Micha@@ el@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed observation points , partly on towers , from which you could see far beyond the pl@@ ural forests and the stored planes .
there was again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ bun@@ nies .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st Market .
again the look@@ out spot to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; pla@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
over the last two days , many elev@@ ators were achieved again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and bur@@ gers brought will@@ ing@@ ing breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ en served the bi@@ kers in the un@@ lock @-@ healing Sole .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the Group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console takes place instead of lawn and Bundesliga for e @-@ sport
sitting in the future , the Sport @-@ Stars seats in future with computer consoles , rather than to fight with wind and weather on the stadium rapidly ?
Fak@@ t is : E @-@ Sport has long since become an increasing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gain rates .
this is also known as the first federal law company , who are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which set up an E @-@ Sport division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to in@@ spire a wholly new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
it is safe , &quot; that there is still a rise in that train . &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Water Association organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; at which the Gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven will have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt is a great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer from Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must result in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ athletes of the contract one could have more often present @-@ up more often in these markets than once in the year to send Asia to Asia .
what is it about ?
when E @-@ Sport are computer games such as &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , or even the FIFA simulation FIFA at competitive level .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen was established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is an unusual one of these needs .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has also been dealt with the question for a long time .
for the Professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions , which can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate differences , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
also , it need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ ake player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but serious problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping will always be a theme &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
scientists investigate the high integ@@ rative effects of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural events .
a study conducted by the Corporate Consult@@ ation of Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federation of Interactive Enterprise ( BI@@ U ) states a rapid growth ahead of the e @-@ sport .
in 2016 it would be implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
the turnover is to be 130 million in three years .
against the just 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga , it is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports types such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez entered the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports Bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ c@@ n .
also in Europe there is quite a lot .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as lessons , F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football first League @-@ club@@ teams are obliged to establish an e @-@ sport division now .
&quot; in the European comparison of Germany , V@@ f@@ B @-@ Managing R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains .
only in nost@@ al@@ gic to fall , and to clari@@ fy the old times , today it is no longer enough .
it is therefore , to keep the tradition of the association , but the company is going to store the company on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; explains D@@ utt &apos;s .
&quot; it is not possible to hold that only when football remains so , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts that Conrad was sentenced to suicide ,
a wife of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind G@@ ers and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was convicted in June for negli@@ gent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ married . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to remain free until the calling .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argue that both them and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter now stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down under the bottom @-@ directed eyes when they were convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the lawyer of the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has not taken responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a &quot; horri@@ fic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they would be un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not found that their age or maturity is a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day , in which I didn &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved Son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want the fact that he is proud of me and how I want to go with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will be worn for the eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; I will never be able to attend the wedding of her brother , or a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more to have this only person , with whom I had together since my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep to me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit to another , suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when he was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hung on , spring from a building , ste@@ er yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything that you must do is open to the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter received attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who authorized Carter , belonged to Am@@ anda Knox that was sentenced to death for murder in Italy in 2007 , when she was acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ature : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua made mud when the captain was allowed to run on the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern is looking for a large season winner for a large season - extra motivation will not appear there .
anything else was in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but because of course and wide , on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ ed and not a Manuel New one , he made up the bin@@ ge of bin@@ ge on the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ il Cup winner later told , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach I could also interpret that .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in the professional player , de@@ but@@ ant and straight from the holiday @-@ coming professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader .
sugar be@@ ys you are distributed to those who want to know much , that you want to keep in mood at La@@ une .
those who have been chosen to compete for the heritage of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ or@@ am confirmed : &quot; that is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old turned over the field as a mini @-@ lead .
right at the rear , that is now his position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm did her rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ature worked in this start@@ up report as the one that can also take the ru@@ der into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ divided tro@@ upe .
he had the look at the whole , while many others were busy .
Vid@@ al that the missing fitness to survive ( folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to aband@@ on their first performance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ als .
that was all very well .

enterprise satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : Economics , Wis@@ sings temp@@ o
it was often ir@@ reconc@@ ile , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , Minister of Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
that shows itself after more than a year in which the new Finance Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and t@@ apped at the same time the old Minister of Ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ als ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke is blocked . &quot;
the largest spin @-@ turn sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge at the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now up in the priority list of the country now .
even this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 shall be established .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West Coast of Trier , which stands in the striking demand of the Federal Office .
the aim was to take up the route in December 2020 , says Minister of Ministers in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the industry and Chamber of Commerce ( HK ) of Trier is aiming at the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing an open ear for people who want to establish a company , commen@@ ds the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of the Trier will see an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprentices in the new Master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent champion review and 2,500 euros , when graduates within ten years after the master@@ ing training .
but the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
during the planned road building , there are quickly facts to create , as at the same time , Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier , says Jan Glock@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers who wants to set the Wis@@ sing on the state company to date , so far 29 positions are occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders of external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ct@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the Au@@ d@@ itors , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receipt of the provincial roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the field in the region in the region .
ern@@ in@@ let is also the old full range of broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with note 3.4 .
they compla@@ in over mol@@ ding Internet connections and di@@ ps .
the ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of the policy and sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbines Pro Wind .

Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ ter is confron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would have to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW spokes@@ person said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving limitations , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit .
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automotive autom@@ akers , to install the neutr@@ alisation of the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , also assume what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful car companies to ignore the signs and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failure of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switching devices that could regulate emissions , when a car has been tested , but driving at normal driving conditions .
several employees have been indicted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not being protected from extradition and could be put in the United States before judgment .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in a criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have acc@@ ust@@ omed to have a system installed in order to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and on request that focused on the United States , was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could be heavily loaded by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen by Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ant and the laugh against the suffering ,
mor@@ dil@@ lo was time of one of the best @-@ published carto@@ ons , the sum@@ mon@@ ies of his figures are the trademark .
also with 85 , the Argentin@@ ian path is still living and works at a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he headed him as a dra@@ fts@@ man for lucky cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lucky day in my professional life was the day when lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris he succeeded in breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s , with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo took many fans .
and again , the artist were inspired by cities .
large , un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo @-@ Fig@@ ures are located in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his personal data , he still sits on the cartoon animation today , works almost ten hours a day .
over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush@@ ers and clo@@ cks are still finding a lot of spread worldwide .
in addition , he has been working on a animation film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ ic@@ ile animal in his drawings , that has a exchange of thousands as a defender .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the chin @-@ up of 2019 .
&quot; I know not exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
this is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , which is produced as its original drawings , what is produced .
Lav@@ en@@ del from the Provence , threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the lack of drought and conditions , due to illness transferred to insects , what scientists and farmers that try to find solutions , great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agri@@ cultural Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past few years , much less rain in spring and fall much more .
this has consequences for the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil does not only demand for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is highly asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry conditions .

the assassination of a repor@@ ter represent the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ urs will normally meet Wedn@@ esdays in order to check their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ disturbed drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe : you should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or let them go home .
security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponent , neutr@@ ale , allies .
you kindly ask the repor@@ ter to propose the name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal pain .
there are drugs @-@ bra@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no resting break from violence , and during all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto have stepped down in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 on attacks and thre@@ ats under Federal Protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter , its publisher and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply perceived , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle fingers with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; are mounted on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical pan@@ am@@ a@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a son@@ ic prosecutor was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most of the thousands of Mor@@ those who are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rarely placed in court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce it still exists to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not east , and although the terrain is still re@@ tra@@ verse .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting at the discussion of certainty little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id , my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why we know all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was given by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot down 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which will be translated with &quot; twelfth river . &quot;
the cap drove in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lefield of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ism fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people on the road are shot , or that the gra@@ ve@@ yard is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug que@@ ens , who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget it for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; when only a cart@@ el control over the coastal area with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first of February there were publication of an interview with Damas@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ izing map fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication likes the sons offended , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the edition as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to force , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same history , leaving the country on its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be considered as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did not happen that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ mand@@ y in 2003 , when he joined the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without to encounter the poison poison problem , &quot; Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
with the time the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honour@@ able coverage , and the turnover and the advertising took place .
repor@@ ter loved it , hard @-@ going investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories , which no one vent@@ ured to handle any else .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , it received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot @-@ Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , where he always led them .
he voluntarily sur@@ rendered that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to move on , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J &apos;s award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you need to take over the task as a journalist , either , or you &apos;re playing dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of many dead . why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team per@@ ver@@ ed Val@@ dez , the fun bird like a harbour worker , who was a friend who was gener@@ ously with U@@ mar@@ ines and Rat@@ chet , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always sit down to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar towards the office and sit there at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death also has forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions in question how they do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starter and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ sur and self @-@ conservation .
trust his own inst@@ ances .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , tar@@ ry gone away .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; od@@ our is a sense that can be cl@@ amped ... and then the cause with Javier happen . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , will not apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is continuously changing .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to safety training , suddenly no cell phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in the outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ class building in a middle class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ter asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor themselves as a trusted .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug bound are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has rested on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a pos@@ pos@@ é to the government spending that focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir sheet from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping session .
there was no official word about it that was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was cau@@ tion that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally on drug vend@@ ors and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public notes that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the Gover@@ ning Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled over the entire century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i Govern@@ ors were accused of having accused of high @-@ car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ man , &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man left a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers had seen the column by Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping session .
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO . &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body .
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for symbols and stick@@ ers who prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees had become something that they would never expect : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few characters and went to a demonstration on the next morning in a demonstration because of another journalists at the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and customs officials , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in all the country , journalists had become strong stronger by the &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; at the organised protests of the &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking routes and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez is going to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez charged the authorities to send journalists and bring them back , because they have said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has asked since it has been asked to be sub@@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her rage has violated its object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico from organis@@ ated crimes , the involved government officials and a uniform company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter could not only be killed by drugs , but also on the orders of policies and security forces that put under the organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists from police and officials in the past year .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously the mor@@ de have a terri@@ fying effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones are next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , under the northern edge of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug category with a guide on the title page with the heading &quot; What will you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as it was evi@@ cted by the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who had been killed together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ome decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traff@@ icking him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to sum@@ s .
a series of shooting paintings featuring band@@ pass and security forces in the vicinity of the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war goes on , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the border edge of the border , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen who kept the guard to see whether they were in will@@ ing@@ ness .
when they were afraid , they did not show it .
among the massive portrait of the fallen gre@@ ens of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same day when Javier was murdered at Javier Javier , who asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to depart from his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now , researchers found that the first findings of an amazing N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even determine that his fla@@ ged skin came from r@@ öt@@ tle Braun - and they said they had had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designated him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state , researchers found it as &quot; really remark@@ ably &quot; to describe it .
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the Geor@@ gian plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green .
he met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rocks on the plat@@ ts , and decided to see more detail .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re just a little with eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creation is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ ament and re@@ sembles a convertible tank , probably of meat @-@ e@@ ater Din@@ osau@@ rs was threatened .
the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide themselves before pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is known as counter @-@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to relie@@ ve his enemies , experts predi@@ ct what was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ wards Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
an amazing preservation of the specimen , it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of shoes and arm@@ or through its body .
it discovered the cone , a true defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its base .
although the cone is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising as the size of the bo@@ at@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out enough pressure by meat @-@ e@@ aters Din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival benefit .
but most contemporary animals that use the cone stimul@@ us - think of deer , zeb@@ ra , or belt animals - are much smaller and hurt as a prey , which indicates that this cam@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong pan@@ din@@ osau@@ rs have been showing how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs have had been the chal@@ k pre@@ dat@@ ors of chal@@ k time , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was brown @-@ brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in regard to his life , including his full int@@ est@@ inal content to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river , and was cast out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because he is completely covered with conden@@ sed skin , but also resi@@ ding in three dimensions and the original form of the beast , he said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks like almost as in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need to use fantasy to construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes sha@@ w@@ ns , you could almost believe that he is in sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ m@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
even though the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ er@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ eled din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus belongs to a length of 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavier .
the scientists , the latest findings in the journal current biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was caught after the death in the sea and surrounded by mud in the mud .
the creation was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was found on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
according to the museum it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle until th@@ igh .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ced by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ eled plant @-@ e@@ aters was sh@@ em@@ med through western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea until a flooded river .
but the underwater ascent of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his armour in the item detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good to obtain that the hood is still covered up d@@ pri@@ ge tanks along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ ving so &apos; rarely as a winning in lottery .
the more I see it , the more , it gets .
remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ dings of the skin , which bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on its side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ bo@@ charger .
there are numerous Ver@@ sions , miles long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people have been hurt in the late afternoon during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first information on the police , at 17.00 hrs there were about 30 vehicles between the junction and Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm .
there are no information on the exact number of recent editions before .
it is a mild to medium @-@ serious injuries , said one pol@@ ls @-@ pre@@ cher .
a big en@@ dow@@ ment of lif@@ egu@@ ards was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres of retreat formed in the direction of Munich .
like an AZ repor@@ ter , it was also on the way to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade det@@ ects the characteristics of the vehicle road , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car collector and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost everyone else : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ens in his work , and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the Schaff@@ ner comes up , and raised up an unclean , or breaks the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control inspection .
but times of interrup@@ tions are past .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ ers at present the most expensive ticket management control .
it simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken up his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; we offer the offer , we extend it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available for many other remote locations in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the driver &apos;s ticket recovery without a career .
in order to be able to use the requirements , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what would you do for most passengers already .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and at least you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : you will be able to call his ticket on &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
the button appears to be an electronic de@@ valuation with the test customers .
the train atten@@ ts a message that the passenger X is located on the train and the booked seat Y has the booked seat .
comes the train conductor at Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ locked online ticket .
thus , it is possible to move further , keep moving further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the trains - what to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our traction personnel , check in the DB file itself easily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board from DB correspondence .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often train , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed trains , the ticket inspection are among the largest doctors .
for often , in any case , one of the competitors do not have any of the documents that you need to use online tickets .
either credit card or identity card is either missing or a document that has to be given .
the result are endless discussions between train and passenger cars , which leads to bad mood in the part or large space and del@@ ays at the conclusion of your own tickets and take action at the end the time to worry about other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell ten@@ te up to its core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the living in St. Louis Prayer was sitting on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat which she rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one had posted on their feed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ am was continuously prayed on their Tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per , which was killed by Michael Brown , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns &apos;s blos@@ som body , which was put out on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell ten@@ dered by Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
you laid her mobile pf@@ one , later on the evening to Twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the Police band and People who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be a shield with inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed when a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she told it , and another policy is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Fer@@ rell to their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not the kind of murder , in which we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to ourselves and that we have typical . &quot;
at that moment , I felt mixing fro@@ st .
I was mad and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , the strength and loss , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who bore a pot@@ ter and a matching crown , came to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , had the two a conversation , which they had in@@ numer@@ able times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember what I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and it will be drawn up .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have experienced the luck to give an experience , in which she personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child .
I have the feeling I would give you an evil service , to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when it arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was given to a camp as the activ@@ ist on the possible non @-@ charge of the Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local company lover , who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass through demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape by Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed a total of 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was as a student at the university of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Association , and concentrated on Es@@ sens &apos;s righteousness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration on Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came by Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a history that you can ut@@ ilize it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ sis became nourished by countless cases of people , often of white and in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as in an interview announced in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ al occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main cause of me to be represented like these people , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ les &apos;s experience - in order to demonstrate that it is not for the motion &quot; not around a Messiah leaders , but for a community that would come together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most important participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ les life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain poor people at this work and the hum@@ ility of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black sw@@ ath@@ ic women in the bro@@ ader black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of movement , who have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , according to the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , sw@@ am women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we struggle constantly in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , pregnant women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a simple type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Fer@@ rell on account of their identity as heart of the movie has been selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who li@@ cked this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was on the front side , because with a life on these cr@@ ates as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the medi@@ ator cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ism between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to the blo@@ cking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social and political atmosphere of the area that they call her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she insi@@ sted on a voice and she feels committed to the road three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Or@@ bit@@ es &quot; : TV reader discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it &apos;s not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone split since the first presentation of 2009 the population in Be@@ ians and opponents .
the subject is hardly any one .
on our Facebook page , &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will discuss the subject .
while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi &#93; set ) or quite simply : &quot; Or@@ bit@@ es ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the advoc@@ ate build on it , a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the remaining shops can also benefit , fear the opponents that the pedestrian street is ble@@ eding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the peasant market hall stands , in which 13 directors will offer their products .
it will end with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Bed@@ a space , with possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the peasant market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also very delicious cakes of the women are very happy again .
we have discovered the but@@ cher to us .
we would like to wish us that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether a market leader in a market hall in the gallery will come to the level of rent .
the new project could probably not be low during the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the most grocery store in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ um@@ - or supermarkets : I find it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even an ordinary weekend market here , it &apos;s all the more important that us stays at least the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered by producers and is ob@@ pure cheap .
as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms , because the local rent are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special shops there are almost no more and what is left , then probably will disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall fits not together for me .
and the gallery is not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bits gallery is actually coming .
or manages it to drive the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a proper peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall they give thanks to the mad many - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the peasant hall was made , it will disappear again a piece of culture . &quot;
suitable simil@@ arity : the artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Haar@@ ons , who were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year sentence , after having made diplomatic messages to the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , says A Bec@@ oming Res@@ identi@@ fier ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline their expertise in technology , computer science and art unified , and Mann@@ ing , a transaction and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sidents who was sentenced to death by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorithm created by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone can look at this gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and created the inher@@ ent detection of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but has been said openly about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 acquisitions , including six verses against the sp@@ ying law , computer was and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is confident of a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ mint - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 @-@ Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ ti@@ an ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette dum@@ b and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extracted from the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of which these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison they wanted to accompany this article to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed . therefore , they took care of Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became too un@@ equal letters that received several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called even a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ orted images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; being a future prev@@ ailing in which the President of Chel@@ ci@@ us would not be able to view the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing would like to ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of lucky meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against Trans@@ ating troops to find new , twe@@ ez@@ ers ways to recover the st@@ ems that he should actually fix to de@@ fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things will happen out of a specific reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the Gallery the artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence was written - an exchange of thousands of C@@ s and Gs and As described in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg trusted by the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ kle@@ ot@@ id after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , as amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people don &apos;t have to take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not why we are , and how openly genetic information is for a interpretation and how subtle they are , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Tra@@ il Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last part of the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she is in hand with a release of hands from the discipl@@ ines of the United States like King Kong @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so it never says the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet you out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve always th@@ aw@@ ed ge@@ ese , when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition yet - as it was happening in the com@@ ic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , which are cl@@ assed as Hor@@ ses of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ is written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a man of man , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels closely with Chelsea , as the movement that ad@@ mi@@ red behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford
a nationwide human dis@@ hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago , with fatal injuries .
on Monday we have exhibited warran@@ ts for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au to demonstrate how the records of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ vings .
a warning system published by the Police Author@@ ities of Chicago published that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officers received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries in his body .

&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er vit@@ ality Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the schedule of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
in this regard , the WA@@ DA @-@ timet@@ able has been updated in this regard , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything to give up in Russia for the reason .
&quot; everything was announced , all will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the findings of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian law of Richard McLaren to the alleged state sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation by since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has made a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ an@@ os words voted with those of vit@@ ality Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point of R@@ sport at the start of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v problems gave the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was held in November 2015 in the course of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA from the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main organisation of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director of Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Sal@@ t wanted to measure luck at your employee at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls did not work .
answers were often v@@ age , little helpful , or even worse - deceit@@ ful .
and even though you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not grie@@ ve the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply no consist@@ ency and Ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society is run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of employees , it allows companies to provide special groups , special groups and demo@@ graphic hot@@ lines , and in some cases in Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to handle C @-@ Suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics are used by companies to measure employees .
salvation said that they think a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap pol@@ ls and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows on a glance , which units have most complaints and which exec@@ utives have low access results - such that you can drill out why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you are not involved in the next U@@ ber , who has published a blog post which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , where a former employee describes a blog post , where those who have spoken will be punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company makes custom @-@ made &quot; Pow@@ der &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers to real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the employee bad behaviour .
and when the main managing director is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators &apos; , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and Managing Director of Conver@@ ters .
if a company is found that his employees are po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience costly consequences due to consumers @-@ Bo@@ yk@@ ott , employee turnover and col@@ lagen , qu@@ lan said qu@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , conver@@ ters for more than a year has to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , when a employee had to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope to be taken seriously .
it was often an en@@ viable and un@@ com@@ promising experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ a General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ters lies , problems that were previously identified by exec@@ utives that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lu@@ ct@@ er tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips will be identified and addressed .
&quot; I can point closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment issues . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 , after the book@@ keeping of Arthur Ander@@ sen had collapsed because of ethnic h@@ ashing by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , qu@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social media came to its right , &quot; that they knew that they could not prevent their dirty wound online .
&quot; prior to use technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer their software as a service and charge the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to be more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley , high levels and interesting projects are only inserts .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to feel in a company that they do , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and E@@ ye@@ e Experience , has been used successfully , &quot; says Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and E@@ ye@@ e Experience .
investors reach R@@ end@@ an@@ ites , if its portfolio companies are well running . company run fine , if employees are using and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise from third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the ste@@ ward of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that this change is in the way .
and if the change isn &apos;t fast enough , or even at all , this dis@@ appo@@ intments can de@@ pl@@ eted and employees .
&quot; when you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company that rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not going to follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you care about it ?
and whom do you not care about why shou@@ ldn &apos;t I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now monthly employee pol@@ ls , was able to run measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , save salvation .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organise multiple teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company to start the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights on employees , and it hopes that in a long run point that leads to a better binding of workers in the industry , known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose clients .
and if you lose clients , you will lose businesses .
the N@@ CA@@ A remov@@ es two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 clock , a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footage on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their Tri@@ ps top parts , and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returned to their aud@@ itor after the three @-@ hour exercise until they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ligh@@ ten the load and it has actually extended its days - at least to the final on Friday .
this is why the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A will begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already completely packed time periods of the player .
the promises of the two days is more than a day when the brood postponed the beginning of Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood saw practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 exercises are going to hold 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal playing preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ pin the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point to the many @-@ time routes of the player .
&quot; we lay this enormous loads three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they just took it , they plac@@ ks up , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , which was made in view of the clear vision of its fields from a adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of a elevated class , which is already a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task to be .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will be able to use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people can rent a room there and then set it to a practice there .
if you have the video from one exercise , it &apos;s a quite good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
so I don &apos;t get too big worry about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages .
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ use to the third party registration of third parties and their results below the original fee , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a memor@@ andum on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mach@@ ined learning methods to detect possible detection messages , which may be able to display possible results of the fact that the original article in the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also affects the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , with the French voters being flooded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks should be punished , even if they do not succeed to eliminate some water post@@ ings like before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate statement on German announced that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories from Fak@@ als checks third parties , people want to see more context to read and share what they read and share , &quot; Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook messages in one blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to continue his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved article &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and works in other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a si@@ p@@ dro@@ ch .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in Kent and now is the inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man , a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript by someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s take the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents within the British Library - a project which he had an unexpected .
&quot; I wrote only on the thum@@ ous printing on the side of a letter so that he was written by a double ag@@ ents in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins .
&quot; that is his thum@@ ous printing !
and letters always smell as smoke , because then a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he himself would be .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with ancient Pap@@ ers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have given my welcome drink a little , &quot; ) it seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; New Castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osity of the castle , as they had spent the mon@@ stro@@ kes on the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke to the artists , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank , &quot; Whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received the full access in 2006 when the last one was , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh what it described on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards which he possessed : &quot; you could say that &quot; you could be bor@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go ahead ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on a wider base in the English story , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant status of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar , which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ern@@ ers , who was hiding the family of Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , which is depicted in the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , having filled his own fun@@ eral , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was dug only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the Lor@@ ds seemed right to be appropriate , always to spend debts and spending money for things they were not able to afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men cast their debt crises when they married old women - I present them as a heap well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advert@@ ise an inheritance . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des on the search for other unique cry experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish game for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ blasph@@ emed , on the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : cover 300 years of old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 years old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef launched her campaign to launch a new roof stamp ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; we ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ released website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and in order to make clear that some better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the sure that we as a bathroom Hon@@ our citizens to appreciate the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action more than &quot; a logo and slogan , it &apos;s further .
&quot; it is valid to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city a distinctive general approach . &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount can be found in Bad Honnef the new umbrella and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan@@ s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August 2009 , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es about retirement and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
such a week as well .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is a routine about the Turkish forces a year after the attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the general meeting , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the heads of state , the five Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister for Defence , In@@ eres , Justice and Foreign Office .
so they were civilians in the year Y@@ as .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
in office , Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commission@@ er of the army , the Air Force and Marine Forces were depos@@ ed .
since the failed cou@@ p , Chief of Staff of the State of 326 the 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the motion of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the P@@ utsch@@ er &apos;s tra@@ ders .
around 486 people , who should have participated in the attempt at the Pass@@ over , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he would give it the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan had really left the army in the handle ?
in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the General Staff there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Occup@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic Army &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , who mani@@ f@@ ests in the abol@@ ition of the head office for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large cleaning process at the army and security forces will continue in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan signed a further 7@@ 395 State services , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan wrote up the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
they made three times by calling on their role as a cust@@ odi@@ al of the world@@ ly state of State .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan run the power of the military step forward by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan was cast out targeted by a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially named officer , who sought for asylum from persecution in foreign persecution abroad , will be the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
when it meets this , NATO could not leave it cold .
meanwhile , in the alliance , there are doubts about the su@@ prem@@ acy of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guide structures and operational capabilities be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card

he se@@ eth to lower the legitim@@ ate immigrants to 50,000 a year , stri@@ c@@ ter regulations for the application of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , wages and save billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way as citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will be able to come good to the candidates who have the financial funds to support themselves and show knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
ministry wants to refurb@@ ishment the route for racing car shuttle
it was always ar@@ gued over the future of the racing car in the past few months - now it is supposed to go quickly .
at the end of the year there is to be built at the mar@@ ital circuit , where the tourist route is to be built .

this sum will exceed 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be voted , declared satisfaction .
the Ministry and the south @-@ south railway as operators are already logged in about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the timet@@ able , which are used vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an atonement for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that was to be ordered by the race gate shuttle on December 2017 .
the cross @-@ gate shuttle is especially popular among tourists popular train connection between the stations Il@@ menau and Renn@@ steig .
in the past few months , during a pilot @-@ operation , the distance of sufficient many people will be used to purchase them regularly in the future .
in addition , the route is very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the ascent of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that in 2017 there cannot be missed , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for responsible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we will begin to take their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eyel@@ id of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people make themselves funny , but the company will deliver lots of them , and we will get them much more likely to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ands have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone g@@ um that feels warm to feel - with conscious human reaction that can be achieved by the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust the robot accordingly to its convi@@ ctions , &quot; and select everything from the eye colour of the robot on the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there will still be more troubled , as many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would look like a step@@ per woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ands have developed to robots with a silicone g@@ um .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt to its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing , such as rel@@ ent@@ ert@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness to the &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of true Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she has also changed their voices - quite like real people !
it can be tired , be fixed on account , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects in this ascent of sex rob@@ ers - not least because they replace real human relations - but the under@@ taking female properties , though you get a step closer to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ den@@ sely ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ qui@@ l a most .
on his site , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex @-@ robots are not only a table or just a different S@@ ex@@ plorer .
their emergence and growing refin@@ ement have a little dar@@ ker and deep@@ ens in our culture , in retreat from the ideal of gender equality in the sexes as an optional allowance .
most men will of course keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R claims its increasing popularity , they still remain preliminary on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what constitutes of the Rand@@ om zones , can be in regards to the Spirit of the time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until they are the free market for this .
there is a certain ass@@ ort@@ ment that these highly developed sex robot in a time appear in which the rights of women are threatened by women in which there is a pre@@ sidents who spoke to have women &apos;s sexual assault .
the horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the devoured body and the em@@ itted eyes , but how realistic this vision effect .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their her@@ nia would like to feel human , that they follow the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it goes around their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; robots are no real women .
they cannot take away from their companion or just go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , which indicates any independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of the fantasy .
expressed in different : they are pleasing slaves .
or in order to express it in the Rede@@ mp@@ ing of 2017 :
Tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney at the concept of healthy human mind
it is become a Bin@@ d of the tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US voters , also split families in small size .
around Christmas and harvest@@ ing made it in the US newspapers with advice on how to choose with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump .
we are all interested in order to make our filter bubbles .
less noted , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families to bring together .
I chose this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago since long , has long been employed in New York for a long time .
she remin@@ ded me of that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can Council , with which they had fought for the politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar at the same side .
in order to make the dining table this certainly is a good thing , but it falls in another connection to that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the exc@@ essive effect of his presidency has the power to move all into the right .
when we speak of &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly way that his toll will no longer be cast us out of the day .
however , there is still a fri@@ gh@@ tening long @-@ time scenario , in the tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alised , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a concept of prevention .
I find myself from an active N@@ ost@@ al@@ gic to Mit@@ t Rom@@ antic version of the back@@ yard - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next Candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as indispensable improvement .
when my cousin was born in the city , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the caravans of the New York park , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ fty and the animals rotate , to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ ousine music conve@@ ys this on a noticeable way .
so many cl@@ ut@@ ees of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings will be old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage . the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the large roundabout at the north of London .
but the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody had asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee from the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to reduce evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also practi@@ cing pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no necessary is required .
the poor woman in the department store was cul@@ min@@ ent while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time in the hospital for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts to his handi@@ craft , which he suffered during the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted for murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first dead belt .
he killed steak in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night in@@ sist@@ ence that was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to submit this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell which they say , she was very op@@ aque .
the prosecution authorities said that they would raise up the Supreme Court of South Africa with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a notable egg .
as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the four towers from F@@ ill and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in school holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will come to the gramm@@ ar school , four at the school school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen an evening .
the 29 students of four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grows in chicken farm , but then release in freedom .
in addition , the lower band led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from its chicken br@@ ushed .
instead of a chicken food , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make of him a chicken , struck the eagle , and spread forth his wings on a high mountain .
afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken ance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who bore the cylinder around the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
indeed , the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but e .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
they wish each quad@@ ri@@ kl@@ ter that he feels for himself in his new school .
it was followed by Dan@@ kes@@ ide to the colleagues , former school@@ master , Michael Müller , who again jumps again in sub@@ li@@ on@@ pas@@ sports , and parents represent the parents .
the kitchen time is over now , explained class@@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very odd , because it had been a really great time .
finally , I finally decided to rely on the four corners .
at the end all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
there were great joy in the children .
eight first companies have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians was imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camps , quoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians was released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camps and place each one who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for that purpose , significant pen@@ alties .
checks will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impos@@ e a fine penalty .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people now need to know
how exactly does the software update takes place ?
do diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe are ass@@ ort@@ ations :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the valid@@ ated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles called by Schumann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fit has ordered the power station of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an effective implementation in the next few months , but still does not have an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
when an inspection is due , the frame will be done within the frame .
how long does the exchange rate go over ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; explains S@@ met@@ anin .
the hang of the commitment to the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , we voluntarily negoti@@ ate the car manufacturers at the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do that drive no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE is to wait for .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ draw , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ 4 ?
the ACE fears it .
but in the regions , where there are elev@@ ators thre@@ aten .
there is no depreciation yet for older diesel in rural areas so far .
the ACE is tied to wait with an sale yet .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .
the first award ceremony on president Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
the LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first Rap@@ per one of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the culinary execution on Thursday , there are also a singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er , Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ drawer ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards were handed to at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awards ceremony .
the award winner of the Progressive TV series was announced , that &apos;s why Le@@ ar announced their participation in the gala to return to the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this term has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights to negle@@ ct them - and they will even be stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan empha@@ sized the conversation with tr@@ ump to clari@@ fy their visibility .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy @-@ Zentrum , is the biggest cultural device in the U.S. capital .
among the former prize winners , Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we are doing the city of life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ x Urban Bu@@ ilder , goes back to R@@ ente in the coming year .
however , the site is already written - suitable applications but are ra@@ r .
for 31 years he has been a freelance town master .
and the work makes it still great fun , as he conve@@ ys in the Press Conference .
he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , ad@@ mi@@ red him that so far you have no application to fulfil the requirements .
the town is looking for the next possible time a architects or engineer .
so , under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular notice period - still enough time to elab@@ oration .
since Has@@ lach was acting to the administrative community as a sub @-@ regulatory authority , the Candidate must show relevant agreements .
since this function wants to keep the city any case .
if she would not be able to fill it with any more , citizens need to take care of the citizens to the Offen@@ burg .
but due to the proximity of the city and itself it is important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good operation and good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been collected so that the h@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is aware of the building of the building and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ mod@@ elling of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space are settled .
the Kin@@ &apos;@@ Bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach shall be renewed , even the stadium restoration is still subject to the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only will beat around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design is present for a town centre of large games room .
with Has@@ selt &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , can be used flexi@@ bly with versat@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so chi@@ pper , and the creation of green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is as a ensemble of monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what would be approved , &quot; emphas@@ ising the separ@@ ating town building .
he is high responsibility in the Stadt@@ bau@@ er .
he is the client , &quot; at the end everything goes on my table . &quot;
for supervision and coordination , it can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( High engineering ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep structure ) has been in existence for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor is long remain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we are looking for someone who really want to be identified and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operation , but also for the other design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to inherit the name of the city of Has@@ lach , he should have completed his diploma as a diploma in engineer or Bachelor &apos;s studies in the areas of construction and construction work .
the building of the building of construction and building construction , building planning , par@@ under@@ ing affairs , administration of urban areas , municipal partnership with building yard and municipal gar@@ dener , as well as sub @-@ legal authority including monument protection .
bicycle on cords : southern route closed
according to the police , the trial had been unknown to reach the blue bike of the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged , that the her@@ b@@ ah@@ ing freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male dishes and search for the night @-@ hours after them .
near the tat@@ too there were witnesses of witnesses a ro@@ cker robot and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y sign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator or the perpet@@ rators could have brought themselves in great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant and the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport services , even P@@ ön@@ alen @-@ Bahn can also be added to the perpet@@ rator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said by one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be led without disabilities .
in the morning , almost ten persons were cancelled , two of which were about correspondence .
goods did not fall , but they were del@@ ays .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for around 200 metres .
isol@@ ators and masts have been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory Dar@@ mer@@ illness )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system such as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could be the symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory ill@@ nesses .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , caused magnets , recur@@ ring or blo@@ od@@ ations , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ers normally , meat and dairy products are advised to avoid their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins that promote the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins which promote a toler@@ ant int@@ estine .
the conduc@@ tive researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the int@@ estine pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in the body do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells which are able to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues .
when the equilibrium becomes too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it may result in a anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory disease .
in experiments , it has found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ cell in mice is present , which bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ation .
and the bacter@@ ium is needed tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us Cru@@ ci@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han saw the mice in their food , the more they had the immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han is toler@@ ated , less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory int@@ est@@ inal herbs , if the same system ob@@ stru@@ cts even with humans .
the Post@@ do@@ ctor in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ da visited a kind of immun@@ cell who found the tolerance when it found out that a group of study powers found such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , but that had not been separated .
they thought that the difference between the int@@ est@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ osis of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i which live normally in the stomach @-@ int@@ estine .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ as and it were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them lack@@ ed mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a gut micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were created the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system , the researchers seized L. reu@@ ter@@ i and caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ able deposits .
as the active component has been cleaned out of liquid , it turned out to be a side product of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ milk acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have toler@@ ate the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i to our stomach @-@ int@@ estine .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ based products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells of people as such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the int@@ est@@ ms .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an expansion of these population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United has signed an &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; for Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at Samp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEFA Cup race against Real Madrid begins , and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Bel@@ iev@@ es .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the blues tour of the Blues and abolished only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was able to make sure that he had to improve prior to the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , how he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent In this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to open three more new orders , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; made three of its four primary duties .
&quot; three of four to get to give thanks to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier when they get four out of four , but they have given a great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew off from Seattle in Washington , but drawing began in the Marqu@@ ette of Michigan , and entered the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
to the radar , the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a car@@ dio for new engines .
Boeing had already taken such advertising earlier .

new Low for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
like the wind , however , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , a social @-@ democr@@ at prime minister in front of elections began with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no interference from the party headquarters , only no counter@@ wind from the federal government - this is the most important desire of the elec@@ toral battle .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , the basic has changed .
since then , the co @-@ workers from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus and increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what was Martin Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described by my counter@@ wind in the approach .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U provides a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once more : red @-@ green is simply not easy @-@ to @-@ press , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fraction of a Green @-@ dep@@ uties has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green Coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has appe@@ aled to her own Lower Saxony @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ west , her mandate to restore her mandate .
the over@@ comes to CD@@ U means a clear re@@ appointment of the elec@@ toral plan .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Business Guide and Ele@@ ction of the Gre@@ ens to the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ed a SPD campaign when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ coming of the green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole rows of large and small crises in the SPD National associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with an unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the com@@ rades set aside .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then too - and indeed everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD @-@ mar@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy .
the com@@ rades re@@ bo@@ unded to the com@@ rade in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had turned their courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next deep was with him .
Mayor of O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus during the weekend because he was sitting in the Als@@ ace , while his city burned .
and because he did in crisis communication so quite everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z figh@@ ts for political survival .
so even Stephan Weil passed away .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister was already in criticism of criticism .
mi@@ ese change values came near .
nevertheless , or perhaps why , because in the past few weeks , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents .
the endeav@@ or of former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , and was not hidden by Martin Schulz in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him , because they were a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
since Weil passed on to the part@@ iti@@ oned of the Lower Saxony , the Lower Sax@@ on Green is not guilty .
and Schulz did not give up .
the com@@ rades will make an effort to stick to keep their own ranks .
her anger is set up for the green , and here , especially on the ab@@ out@@ sider parliam@@ ent@@ ations in T@@ amp@@ ur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cies such as Mrs. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets on her own career of care@@ ers about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the par@@ r@@ ink in the SPD federal state department , the editing network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected to Parliament because of their person as a direct can@@ did@@ act , but was elected to the national list of Lower Saxony for Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxony MPs further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , compla@@ ined a democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral wil@@ ts of four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD leading to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of career with the future CD@@ U @-@ dep@@ uties showed the elec@@ toral result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or it was given to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funds for Center III
who wants to spend his coming home in the years , may get the next support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler , and three representatives of jet@@ ty urban development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again granted a review to the so far .
since 1991 it is in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the I from 1991 to 2004 , Baden @-@ Württemberg State took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous ch@@ marks are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , one will receive the information from government agencies in Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the municipality of Emp@@ fingen .
how does a sanit@@ ising area now emerge ?
you will continue to study Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it plays also a role , whether in the planned region &apos;s planned interest , to san@@ ate .
if necessary , the area of the area could be moved again .
the Ste@@ g moved on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would then be carried out within the framework . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the residential and working conditions and delivery of infrastructure .
measures may be objects in objects , that is to be carried out per plot .
finally , the renovation area would finally be defined as a statute .
the licence period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
however , until September this year , however , the existing inventory would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation department .
as early as November or December , as possible , the pro@@ vocation must be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that any commune had to carry out pre @-@ investigations .
it is therefore , to evaluate the urban structural gu@@ ardi@@ ans and decide when it is renovated and in which gir@@ th .
it is intended to be entered into the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again to Emp@@ fingen , and make a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized that a significant success rate for the project is the participation of the involved parties involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that can be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and may be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and plot arch &quot; where it is among other things about constru@@ cting state and renov@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing ar@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be made up to the size , distribution and residents of a residential space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if in the building business premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is to be noted that Got@@ zel showed that a balanced questionn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding .
in addition , new construction measures do not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler empha@@ sized that the distribution of the funding goes according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog Prin@@ ciple &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ d first .
it is possible to reserve no funding for later . &quot;
at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ ner II &quot; project was shown in order to make a san@@ itation to the restoration .
British inventor itself uses a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step to enter his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index , now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy your life with technology due to the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has merged with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisor at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , merged in order to ensure that the im@@ plant procedures is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology similar to a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , an Navy helicopter to fly for an event that fixes American production in the last month costs tax pay@@ ers according to the data of the military which were left over the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president on board was on board , the heart of the event was at the White House with American builders .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officers of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
in addition to a yacht made by Maine , a fire fighting car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi , in addition to a yacht .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter bolt in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on South La@@ wn . following the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commented on the eve of the event , the Deputy Commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event around 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was in the event during the event during the event , while the security staff remained at the plane during the time at the plane .
from which the TI@@ ME was provided , it wasn &apos;t clear whether a second flight crew was required .
at Brands Hatch Act , Federal President provides responsibility to use state ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked if there was a violation of the Brands Hatch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote of the Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you are sealed , &quot; The Deputy Commander answered .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Brands Act .
but the official events also have political tones .
on the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to establish the government regulations .
the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon in politically beneficial purposes .
the president is obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only demand for a photo surgery is un@@ common .
tr@@ ump led in February an investigation as the presidential airplane in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the Presi@@ dential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the American workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the deputy director of the White House , Lind@@ sey Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to add US President in the White House with precise decor@@ ations .
as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced into the White House 58 practice sessions .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted by the training demands of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers received the burden for none of the other in@@ quis@@ ites that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in it to exhibit helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not support Bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for the Presi@@ dential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D re@@ funds for the v@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded the flight time by plane of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia next 30 minutes .
the White House ar@@ gued that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for the tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on estimates of the estimates of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a Rand study from 2015 , the equi@@ pping rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into consideration the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press conference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is natural , of course , to raise it up . &quot;
it was not clear whether tr@@ ump was inter@@ ag@@ ated with the helicopter when he had his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
at the White House , Tr@@ ump is a representative of Si@@ kor@@ sky and moved with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ butes task
peak @-@ re@@ iter of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga stand in the position of the position SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ lo@@ p Race SV .
despite five games still mak@@ es@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the top @-@ re@@ iter of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga received the sense of reality .
at least , team manager Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for opponents before the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite a similar formation .
straight to the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability when the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV ensure the imports coming from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay , overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is how it &apos;s hard for us .
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is practical .
his debut for Blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
manages to be the moment at the Ch@@ allenger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , French@@ man does not come to the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be used for his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski still at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again take the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was number one of the Junior World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , does not fill any one from the train@@ ee from the train@@ ee to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
truly , Donald Tr@@ ump did not be happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law on the disappearance of the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his absence the law en@@ acted , &quot; the congress has given a few &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations . &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was also sharp as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the U.S. stum@@ bling block .
after all , the design is to be able to furn@@ ish European businesses that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
since then , investors have been funded by the local O@@ MV in cooperation with other European firms , co @-@ financed the Construction of Russian Eastern Europe Tour North Stream .
the thr@@ ott@@ le is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have had to raise the sanctions yet by executive order .
twelve weapons are available for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has looked at which the group could escape , and which could really we@@ do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is in the center of Net@@ fli@@ x .

role back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen aid
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch time again .
with fixed contacts for the children and an order to the team .
the watch is turned back in the urban day@@ care centres .
on 1 September the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back in its own .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
a cat@@ erer continues to be boiled beside house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh boiled water cooled down .
the city operates in the fields of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a hot meal .
last year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need grow steadily .
&quot; we can not only eat children who are taken care of 45 lessons , in K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explained Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; the offer also applies to 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay till 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 participants from 1 September kitchen services ; they have warm the delivered food , supplement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ings as well as seven @-@ eng@@ ths facilities - decides about the hour@@ ly circumference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance is satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is about healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are to help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; you have a known force in K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
these continu@@ ity be important for the children .
the su@@ ber@@ ation of K@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in future by special cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that they have issued in cost comparison between own reg@@ ie and foreign policy to the city than the most economical solution , says the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong in the legal gu@@ ardian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN

G@@ MB @-@ Occup@@ ation about investments in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers at the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which also introduces other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ in said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added the employees and trade union representatives , &quot; as the first of them , would change if their activities were changed .
in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns to sell that financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity of the needs of needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the vast territory of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent work in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ ite , the rising loss of life and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow was urgent to a th@@ ri@@ cally clean production point at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross was only to receive a letter of G@@ MB , and the company will react directly on it as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all companies active in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our business is continuously in@@ spect - and this applies to all of our business sectors and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and quite an . if our operational processes are changed at the site , employees and their union representatives shall be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga enjoys her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after they had given an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger its fre@@ ew@@ ays , but have warned them over three years before the world attack ?
the sensational approach has set the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds .
after the completion of N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is li@@ vid above the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to outside , although a source has always been a source near the Catalan executive board , that the club has always been given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned by the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi negotiated a strict warning for each club to sign up one of the best players from PS@@ G .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ inion report ent@@ ert@@ et Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Reg@@ ens@@ burger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation report on the abuse of abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ o atzen is continuing to offer discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man of the Re@@ unification , &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication against the German press agency , he acquired by the former Reg@@ ens@@ er Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , and of the Dom@@ kap@@ elle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the respect of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have their deepest sub@@ mer@@ cies over own sub@@ om@@ is@@ sions or their time false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican News &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was measured in reporting on violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reference to the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be punished by &quot; dirty and hum@@ ane acts , &quot; so the author Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is intended for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
princip@@ ally in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk &apos;s interview : &quot; you like to go on to the church and that &apos;s a great fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready to become ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they dig themselves un@@ fair , today standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports over the abuse of abuse , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared in connection with the reports .
wrong to wrong , author and histor@@ ians Michael H@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My Brother of the Pope . &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 page report , presented by the Secretary of the diocese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of attor@@ ney at law Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ estic atzen were sexually ab@@ used .
at the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ ize the fact that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
even in case of very high emot@@ ion , the punishment of the students could also be severe .
however , contrary to many other authorities , many victims of general humanity falls of R. rated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are connected with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ emann , why the final report of abuse of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger declared his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; Pre@@ cip@@ ation of Viol@@ ation of Viol@@ ence in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ elle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for an up@@ lifting many students , he revealed his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as cholesterol and Perf@@ ect@@ er , who became the ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ y brought musi@@ cally no top performance .
how do you find this final report ?
Michael H@@ emann : if you make the effort to read and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask for why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is ever ahead of it .
he has just been eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly suspic@@ ious from any suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or co @-@ breeding in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school events occurred outside of its activity @-@ sphere .
it can be ir@@ relevant to him , from it to late , or first evidence to have taken seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school , in which he worked , was considered to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his students &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; very well @-@ good teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons and has always been surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about its Perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion that led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
that he didn &apos;t just cast it with chairs and cast the key Federation on the ground , but also put ear@@ nest on the hair , or ears , he has already admitted even before years , deeply sad@@ dened and exc@@ used for it .
however , it must be said to his honour , however , such correc@@ tive methods in the fra@@ ct@@ ance time , the 1960s and 1970s , have been widespread , with parents as in teachers .
do you know also such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gramm@@ ar school .
compared to what about it actually comes in this report , namely the de@@ ar@@ able sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , these are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there is no matter if you do not seem to do with his acquain@@ tance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI &apos;s brother , that many media has just fell on him .
in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him , are still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the context of the report it was reported very much about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Foundation .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report even some processing or collabor@@ ative with regard to sexual abuse on load ?
Michael H@@ emann : definitely no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted to the cathedral champion .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never comforted myself , with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected of understanding for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , however , is that most victims were silent .
if they did not even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral conductor , who had been a colleague to have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rator .
how do we rate R@@ atz@@ inger P@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a frag@@ ment@@ ary student formulated it so : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no event , in which he was reck@@ oned ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) , and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rator .
I think it ... even for really absur@@ d to accept that ... Bu@@ ben int@@ ru@@ de or cle@@ arer or more clearly opened , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ors , confi@@ denti@@ sts , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one speaks with him about sex .... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that , in the lead of affected people and / or their environment , he could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of charge of every fellow abuse .
thus he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradi@@ ctions in connection , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; violence ex@@ ams &quot; in the case of reg@@ im@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ elle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having responded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous domain name &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this incident ?
Michael H@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting it all mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
it will be clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar school of the cathedral atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , rest .
in addition , the report reports from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did not have ch@@ oral manager of the cathedral state .
the whole terrible investig@@ ational education , the cases where boys from seasonal teachers were correct and mal@@ ar@@ led and mal@@ e@@ ably , occurred all on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ous states must have been prev@@ ailing .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ elle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school .
on it was , like most witnesses , the topic &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
you only was happy to be dis@@ able and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different in the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael H@@ emann : there was already discipline there , but no sa@@ vor@@ ous violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of humanity by R. rated and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
at the most , the pre @-@ ten@@ ding , have to be removed .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and took up the predecessor at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
opened Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school , which the report is even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out to this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the testing was still pract@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already , in view of the danger of negative pres@@ sions , he might seem to reach the result .
that was of course , of course , in fact , as a legal clarity , was already banned in Bavaria in Bavaria .
before that , it occurred in a legal grey zone , just like everyone knows of us .
this was too difficult for him , where people may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dra@@ fted and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say too , he had always looked away .
that is not true .
only in 1980 , the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is claimed to be un@@ fair , use today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ emann : we histor@@ ians talk about the case of &quot; Fall@@ u@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the risk of evalu@@ ating today &apos;s moral standards .
then the prin@@ cess has already been right .
but this is not true of course for sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school law and violence against innocent children , which goes far beyond the usual .
that is all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally processed .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funding to the discipl@@ ines and pun@@ cture , so cra@@ ven and to pull the hair and ears , were widespread far in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is then forbidden , he also has kept himself to it .
what image of its Reg@@ ens@@ burger era has George R@@ atz@@ inger in the discussions with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of testing was also used for the language ?
Michael H@@ emann : now , in the book , I am talking about his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI &apos;s life , says from his perspective , as they played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t miss it , that he was a stri@@ ped reg@@ iment there .
but this also has to be said to be said : without these perfect discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ fare , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not have a great singer and before every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ transfer .
what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from the discussions with her book ?
Michael H@@ emann : thanks to his work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and again experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , delicate and heart@@ ed people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could not be able to do anything in one fly .
I &apos;m travelling regularly with how many former Dom@@ estic atzen is still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , reading him , he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not been given to him today that he was strictly strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ estic atzen are now than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them the world of music .
and that he always became a good , good teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a loving respect to respect , to whom they are still looking at today and to honor them .
and , at once again clearly : everything that has been pre@@ th@@ ed to him are legal methods that were at that time on the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is prominent and one even more prominent brother to make the media goat .
there is an evil intention that is behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now it would be responsible for a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large services , and without which outside of Bavaria , and perhaps there &apos;s probably no one that nobody wants to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
