<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where people can meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">We use a small gardener to the single reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich delivers exciting stories too days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when Landcards are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that the car had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi takes place instead of a circumvent road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geographer as Bavaria of State Government, are everything else but still very rich.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it will be clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury area since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a tile carpet that can be seen as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture map, detailed maps were incorporated for cities and municipalities, so-called urine leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayermination Administration council between 1810 and 1864, resulting from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800 the French forces of the Army occupied Bavaria with Austria in the spring of 1800.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon chose an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched at the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbours that created the idea of an extensive Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian government administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The document sheet for Munich dates from 1856, and is how many others on the website of the Bavarian State Library can be found.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the example of the state capital by the national capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded into all directions, and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">The victor was set up 21 years after the map of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Undersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendans concentrate on today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after 1878 after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, there is nothing but fields - at the first glance: when zooming appears a smaller partial card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten book-pieces from the so-called "Urching," which was derived from the property.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are little plots there today, no farmers live there - but small gardener of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, at the October of October, actually still a meadow, and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical card gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the Urination sheet you read in the area of today's au-Haidhausen area not only the street names" "" "on the path" "" "or from the hill" "" "On the air" "" "but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road, people once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Apostle Irrenanstalt" "" "was created" "" "on the auspices." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudder headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and finished for example the purchase of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has allowed the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haider Museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first was first place, and later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not attain any more - the reason for the construction of the Kreisironic anstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are now young people in Munich salesanum on the grounds of the former Auer Ward.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and was converted into a youth home with training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children House Casa Don Bosco "was erected in architectural rejection to the origin of the Irene anstalt, which was destroyed in bombing raid in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was around 1856 as" main square "" "," the merchants "" "" Kaufinger street "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change in the second world war was also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke off numerous holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The British Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at Marienhof, where these days work and will take place on April 5, 2017, for the second suburban railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Published for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union to promote color has a warning for colour people, due to the discriminating policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, because a series of fragmentalists may occur within the entire State and listed here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to complain complained of discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which aim undisproportionate to minorities, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have any injuries of the civil rights to pass through.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are killed because of their skin colour, they are joined or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents in the university of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragmentality at the beginning of the year, after he was no longer vated by the state during the journey, and was taken by the police in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also has a recent report published by the Office of the Office of Missouri, which is shown that black people in the state will be more likely to hold 75 percent more often than the White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Mays.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring whether to bring a deposit money or relatives, that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="64">The travel agreement is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of residence or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Liberties Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel agency for Texas and Arizona, following the immigration authorities to proudly the local prosecution authorities to help people who contribute to the ACLU's list for further development.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but at the last time stakeholder groups have the measure to have a response to certain laws and trends in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weifence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weifaun project is a successful project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag to Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture in front of the site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Schwendemann family came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest management, 40 dairy cows and also many young children, and also houses five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is the alternative-based marketing way for him of the milk of his cows, pivot." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">There is only regional guests on the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also important at the FHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he is important to demonstrate the fence project than "elementary."</seg>
<seg id="75">I don't have thinning a steep areas on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for much work, much must be machined with the cutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and the topography" "", "stressed pidemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elternal operation and taken care of this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayors Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the community has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers must have to be supported by 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the list of surfaces of the surfaces could be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and are doing thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "the mayor stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often standing in the critique of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In total, 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The revealing area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be heated up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted over leader, a quarter wore the commune of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stayed 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasised: "you do not make a good job, without farmers, and landwives."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "even for Peter White stand firm:" "" "best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Department (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg allows the state promotion of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the revealing of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of a dPR-drawn conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the unfenced area must not be ppered (Hangneiction above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the orderer.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The action area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump is now taking into the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The sure sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate that as every other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's overthrow at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe with Jim Acosta of CNN on the suggestions of the President for drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat houses and Liberty Imitators had accustomed to him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller wrote Acosta: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about story, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to, which was later added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies properly, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the rushing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only charges any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labors, your poor, are free to breathe, and to breathe out free from the coasts of your coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elaborated trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Not in literary criticism - he did not make sure that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death at the base - did not know that they are complete a highly political hand.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism by presenting them in a classical painting depiction the female bonding of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the object with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great carpal Rush Limbaugh, a nature of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was enforced, but rather an early neo-condoms, which will bring the american flame into the converted world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">She shall bear the torch of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not have the way to shine in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasian act of Lazarus was in it, as they see from the exhaustive, but hopeless people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about the truest sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and opportunity to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective that you want to recognize Miller and trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not shine on the way, but the hatred, who is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black is a Scottish member of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminded of a time when two sots were owned by the UK.</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will be a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland has developed something special," and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to pass, until we find it," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with him, what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy above the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">What is always the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance, whereas Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to the team capitulation.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their surrender speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or practice or practice, they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh brought quite natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles will say that it is "incredibly" that 16 bulls in the British squad are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland has so far been the best total number of athletes at the World Championships seven who were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle class Muir runs on this path and last year, five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is a further shot, one after a great season that was able to win the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships, the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Manna-Chapterin says that she is very proud of "the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special about the team of Team was in fact that it was elected by the other members of the team, so that there was a great honour to me, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and voted" "" "make it something very special for me," "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes wanting to ascend from Poor.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a chapter?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are in this situation very happy because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and will simply be a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block your core through Facebook: don't block you for a public office if you don't want to heat this frying</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the inner policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimply the critique of criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "the vine was taken away - and, stupid, and silent, we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan who has to work out more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Liberties Liberties Union disguised him about this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governors left the suit as freezing, and the online review was full of a counterreaction with "Na," and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a real heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primowing funds to join himself with his voters and to devishend his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons appearing on the side of the Board - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially recognized and from employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing further than a presenter.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of Trolls or spammers or water-filled people who vibrate online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who are talking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman, and a pastor, no movement.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments was respectful, thinkly and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bolas, Md., was not water-water, but she asked to stop Hassle.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassbreaking and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news program "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I guess this idea is not when a number of people on the same topic, then they will be accepted by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governors as "concentrated spam attack, would probably be" interrupt. "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn or dismantled newspapers with critical traders and bring to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants, who has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked off from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the board of the Board of Supervisors in Loudoun County, published in Alexandria, according to the US District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, served as a voter from their facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Prein (R) received a visit from the ACLU's use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiples between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mail writer smote his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous Troll.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church it will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant, a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours at their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini highlights: "it is a unique village of Belod."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle had been mentioned for the first time in the Württembürgonialism: the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen with his cousin Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the testimony according to the document arose at the Tumlinger mountain apart from the parish church, also a magnificent court that belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There are people also living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the City Office of 1858, next to the Lower village and the Oberdorf, which is still visible today in the town picture of tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the splendid settlers of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old cards from time around the year 1600 were underlined by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronics was created from the early medieval yline law.</seg>
<seg id="477">One Lord, who built a church, heaped out and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could not inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus the right to take a priest, or to the bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger one of the two zeros on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was first discovered in 1692, but had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year-old war (1616-1648) the windows of windows were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 The French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened by 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius was also served as the last resting place for the dead in listening.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm split the tower of Kirchtower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent a misfortune, the tower was broken down.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the existing tower-werg today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to stay, as they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger print.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The policy-makers of the Social Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted to hold up to 0.25%, with less members of increasing interest in this month since the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media value of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a constant course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first day of working with executive employee, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps white house which he repairing with wool: bad information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letter - because the president would make better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to count trump by taking over his media law.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relation to television is back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV shows still heavily.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the Trump was denied because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was given a fair coverage of places which were to convince," said the former voter pilot consultant Sam Nunberg in February to politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns in this purpose, ensure that his personal media sum includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit is ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this struggle officials know something, what we don't know other - that Trumps Tweets could have not contain any more ignition types without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the Tweets that has not sent trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his co-workers made it a number of times, stumbling by him, their efforts have worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoiding that trump controversy calls.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem consists of that people in a white house, which are struggling from competing parties to present their own agenda by presenting trump material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisors, to support the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of the reporter Shane Goldmaker was described:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that trump is how a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he would find out to find out from whence they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone offered a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap at his Leccos' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned permanently from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has sold wrong allegations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to question people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to implement and document the trump. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same Kelly three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as Priebus but Trump is still his pulse self, and his counselors are still seeking influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the committee started work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" signed up with the cause of the people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded his investigations to intensify its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first efforts of Grecian in connection with a meeting between Trumps EltestiSon and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">US Intelligence accused the Kremlin to have been mixed up in 2016, targeted by the presidential election in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In Mueller, Mueller examined whether there were different from Trumps Election Team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigation, several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicers.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took more and more trumps of private and business environment under the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, wrote some weeks ago that the special nobleman Trump entered into the center and undergone a throw-off, whether the president could handicapped justice in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main assignment of Grand Lawys is to check out and decide whether the charge is to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">In the Grand Jurys, the Prosecution also are also called.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of mostly they are switched on when it is greater and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure shall always be closed behind the closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the board can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to download persons under an oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN broadcaster has already been issued prior to turn, turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called to a testimony, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Furthermore, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also trumps consultant and mother-in law Jared Kushner as well as his director Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts told us on Thursday evening in the US television that the entry show that Mueller will not leave in his work and that it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not be noted that the Grand Jury will be switched on to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nonetheless, the objective of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new revelations, the President of the Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that the president will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something has changed since it was in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after trump comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rooting, demonstrations against Trump had become noisy, he would not interfere with justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him an attitude of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands under a large pressure for the examination.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it could be associated with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken piston was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Thus it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America close to the forefront of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this gravel pit was the balance of wax and disruptions a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete slumfeis to fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is at risk, because the front edge has never been withdrawn, as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate rise under tension and could be broken down, if a piece of a key is at a place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water swimming and ice cream as much water as it gives the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shaft leads to that the glacier goes directly to the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could eventually increase the sea level, but only in a small size, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">With almost 50 000 square kilometers, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest park of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, along the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural event and we have no direct link to climate change, the ice plate now comes in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now come back or in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not lead the heaval of this gigantic ice vineyard to climate change, so in the past decades very many skelks of the Antarctic peninsula are broken down.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the lack of drought and conditions, due to illness transferred to insects, what scientists and farmers that try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past few years, much less rain in spring and fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has consequences for the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterial, the dwarf-cades, and with very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil does not only demand for vacationers, it is highly asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">To the solutions that are considered to be considered, include a better water distribution and the slowdown of the evaporation from the ground, but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a reporter represent the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodours will normally meet Wednesdays in order to check their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and undisturbed drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe: you should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the goal of a attack with grenades, or let them go home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponent, neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You kindly ask the reporter to propose the name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs-bragler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting break from violence, and during all the country the corpses, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have stepped down in December 2012. 589 on attacks and threats under Federal Protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, its publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply perceived, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle fingers with the word "Justice," are mounted on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts that show its smiling face with glasses or its typical panamaut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a sonic prosecutor was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of Morthose who are associated with drug trafficking and organisational crimes each year, the murderers are only rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce it still exists to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not east, and although the terrain is still retraverse.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting at the discussion of certainty little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why we know all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was given by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot down 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which will be translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in January last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefield of the country, since rivalism factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people on the road are shot, or that the graveyard is full of embellished, two-story Mausoleen for drug queens, who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget it for a minute that there is a state of "rest," when only a cartel control over the coastal area with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of February there were publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rivalizing map fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication likes the sons offended, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the edition as soon as she was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same history, leaving the country on its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be considered as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did not happen that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Normandy in 2003, when he joined the founding of Riodoce to the founding of Riodoce, and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without to encounter the poison poison problem," Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honourable coverage, and the turnover and the advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard-going investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories, which no one ventured to handle any else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, it received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot-Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where he always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily surrendered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to move on," he said at the time of CPJ's award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task as a journalist, either, or you're playing dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of many dead. why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team pervered Valdez, the fun bird like a harbour worker, who was a friend who was generously with Umarines and Ratchet, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always sit down to El Guayabo, the bar towards the office and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced them to ask their own assumptions in question how they do their work on the best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it, if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starter and runways," to move drugs. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-sur and self-conservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instances.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, tarry gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "odour is a sense that can be clamped... and then the cause with Javier happen."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, will not apply in Sinaloa, no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is continuously changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce to safety training, suddenly no cell phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">In the outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-class building in a middle class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporter asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the policemen, who described the governor themselves as a trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug bound are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has rested on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a posposé to the government spending that focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir sheet from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping session.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it that was abducted or as it happened, so it was caution that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally on drug vendors and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the Governing Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled over the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri Governors were accused of having accused of high-carcinogenic cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapman," Guzman left a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers had seen the column by Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping session.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO." because of its slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for symbols and stickers who protested against the murders of journalists because the employees had become something that they would never expect: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few characters and went to a demonstration on the next morning in a demonstration because of another journalists at the Office of the Prosecutor's Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and customs officials, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country, journalists had become strong stronger by the "SOS Press" at the organised protests of the "SOS Press" on walking routes and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is going to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez charged the authorities to send journalists and bring them back, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"" "" "" "she has asked since it has been asked to be subdivided by the government because she is concerned that her rage has violated its object." ""</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeated that journalists in Mexico from organisated crimes, the involved government officials and a uniform company. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporter could not only be killed by drugs, but also on the orders of policies and security forces that put under the organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists from police and officials in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they would like to hold the mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the morde have a terrifying effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas de Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones are next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen, as the newspaper El Norte, under the northern edge of Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug category with a guide on the title page with the heading "What will you want of us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries, or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as it was evicted by the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who had been killed together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Georgian plant-eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, green.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rocks on the platts, and decided to see more detail.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you're just a little with eyes blind, you could almost believe that it has slept," "" "said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creation is visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with armament and resembles a convertible tank, probably of meat-eater Dinosaurs was threatened.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as counter-atting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to relieve his enemies, experts predict what was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstewards Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">An amazing preservation of the specimen, it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of shoes and armor through its body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">It discovered the cone, a true defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the cone is customary, the results are surprising as the size of the boatopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased out enough pressure by meat-eaters Dinosaurs, that evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the cone stimulus - think of deer, zebra, or belt animals - are much smaller and hurt as a prey, which indicates that this camdosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong pandinosaurs have been showing how dangerous dinosaurs have had been the chalk predators of chalk time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosaur was brown-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal in regard to his life, including his full intestinal content to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and was cast out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta were as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because he is completely covered with condensed skin, but also residing in three dimensions and the original form of the beast, he said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks like almost as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use fantasy to construct it. if you're just a little with the eyes shawns, you could almost believe that he is in sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Thermodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Even though the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Boeropelta, the paneled dinosaurs was chased by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">The Acrocanthosaurus belongs to a length of 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavier.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, the latest findings in the journal current biology, believe that Borealopelta was caught after the death in the sea and surrounded by mud in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creation was found by Shawn funk, when he was found on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, pit.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armament, and is completely from the muzzle until thigh.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the paneled plant-eaters was shemmed through western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea until a flooded river.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater ascent of the dinosaurs keep his armour in the item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good to obtain that the hood is still covered up dprige tanks along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preserving so 'rarely as a winning in lottery.</seg>

<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, the strength and loss, the strength and power of resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who bore a potter and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, had the two a conversation, which they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was given to a camp as the activist on the possible non-charge of the Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local company lover, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to pass through demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape by Ferrell form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed a total of 9 August," she said and noted that she was as a student at the university of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Association, and concentrated on Essens's righteousness and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell during an evening demonstration on Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said," "" "she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document" "", "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came by Ferrell in the sense:" do you want to document or try to find a history that you can utilize it? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepsis became nourished by countless cases of people, often of white and in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2063">The folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Todestal occupants.</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelles life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2071">Moreover, Ferrell's history repeats the role of the black swathic women in the broader black-Lives movement.</seg>

<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social and political atmosphere of the area that they call her home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "Orbites": TV reader discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it's not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone split since the first presentation of 2009 the population in Beians and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject is hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg" will discuss the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit-gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human needs" (Siggi] set) or quite simply: "Orbites!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate build on it, a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the remaining shops can also benefit, fear the opponents that the pedestrian street is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the peasant market hall stands, in which 13 directors will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will end with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Beda space, with possibility to sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost every week in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mostly our eggs, but also very delicious cakes of the women are very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher to us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish us that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether a market leader in a market hall in the gallery will come to the level of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project could probably not be low during the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most grocery store in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drum- or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even an ordinary weekend market here, it's all the more important that us stays at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered by producers and is obpure cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms, because the local rent are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops there are almost no more and what is left, then probably will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall fits not together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery is not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration when the bits gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or manages it to drive the ghost bit gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a proper peasant market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer market hall they give thanks to the mad many - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant hall was made, it will disappear again a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">Suitable similarity: the artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Haarons, who were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst made a 35-year sentence, after having made diplomatic messages to the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on August 2, says A Becoming Residentifier (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline their expertise in technology, computer science and art unified, and Manning, a transaction and groundbreaking dissidents who was sentenced to death by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithm created by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone can look at this genomic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and created the inherent detection of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward was born, but has been said openly about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 acquisitions, including six verses against the spying law, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white fie, in which Manning is confident of a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde permint - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012-Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from fortian artefacts such as cigarette dumb and chewing gum, extracted from the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of which these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison they wanted to accompany this article to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg declared a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed. therefore, they took care of Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait.</seg>

<seg id="2139">"" "they called even a" "" "Shoili Kanungo illustrated" "" "Supported images" "", "being a future prevailing in which the President of Chelcius would not be able to view the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning would like to ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of lucky meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the governmental camp and against Transating troops to find new, tweezers ways to recover the stems that he should actually fix to deflaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things will happen out of a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the Gallery the artistic statement called Manning with their oversized signature, including (the "i" in her family name) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence was written - an exchange of thousands of Cs and Gs and As described in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted by the involvement of the 200 letters (or nukleotid after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people don't have to take with them is that our genome is not why we are, and how openly genetic information is for a interpretation and how subtle they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Trail Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last part of the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she is in hand with a release of hands from the disciplines of the United States like King Kong-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics are used by companies to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Salvation said that they think a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company which shows on a glance, which units have most complaints and which executives have low access results - such that you can drill out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture, so that you are not involved in the next Uber, who has published a blog post which has been published in Skandals, where a former employee describes a blog post, where those who have spoken will be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize, saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent Company makes custom-made "Powder" surveys, confidential answers to real time and view the heat-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with the employee bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main managing director is included, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of public opinion has recorded the Regulators'," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and Managing Director of Converters.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees are poorly treated or unethical, it can experience costly consequences due to consumers-Boykott, employee turnover and collagen, qulan said qulan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, converters for more than a year has to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when a employee had to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an enviable and uncompromising experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tua General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company converters lies, problems that were previously identified by executives that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unlucter traineeships will be identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can point closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in employment issues."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employees in 2002, after the bookkeeping of Arthur Andersen had collapsed because of ethnic hashing by the Enron scandal, qulan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "Social media came to its right," that they knew that they could not prevent their dirty wound online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"prior to use technology for monitoring the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Converters offer their software as a service and charge the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converters received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research, which shows that today's employees expect more to be more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high levels and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to feel in a company that they do, and that the work that you do is worthwhile," Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Eyee Experience, has been used successfully, "says Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Eyee Experience.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendanites, if its portfolio companies are well running. company run fine, if employees are using and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools promise from third parties to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about the employee commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless when the steward of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a anticipation that this change is in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change isn't fast enough, or even at all, this disappointments can depleted and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"when you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks," Russell Raath, President of Consulting in Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the company that rely on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now monthly employee polls, was able to run measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, save salvation.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting the feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganise multiple teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company to start the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights on employees, and it hopes that in a long run point that leads to a better binding of workers in the industry, known for high sales.</seg>

<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until they are the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain assortment that these highly developed sex robot in a time appear in which the rights of women are threatened by women in which there is a presidents who spoke to have women's sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphical pictures, the devoured body and the emitted eyes, but how realistic this vision effect.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots, there is a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their hernia would like to feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it goes around their "personalities," robots are no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot take away from their companion or just go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing, which indicates any independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of the fantasy.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed in different: they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or in order to express it in the Redemping of 2017:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney at the concept of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a Bind of the trump era, that the political divisions, who have polarized the US voters, also split families in small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvesting made it in the US newspapers with advice on how to choose with the horror of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all interested in order to make our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted, the power of Trumps, families to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-wing Dichterin, who lives in Chicago since long, has long been employed in New York for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me of that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican Council, with which they had fought for the politics, suddenly and very peculiar at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this certainly is a good thing, but it falls in another connection to that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump, but the excessive effect of his presidency has the power to move all into the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the gruselly way that his toll will no longer be cast us out of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a frightening long-time scenario, in the trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalised," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a concept of prevention.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active Nostalgic to Mitt Romantic version of the backyard - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both occur in comparison to trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next Candidate of the Republicans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as indispensable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was born in the city, we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the caravans of the New York park, and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are crafty and the animals rotate, to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the limousine music conveys this on a noticeable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clutees of a city disappointing: the views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage. the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the large roundabout at the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody had asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee from the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to reduce evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also practicing pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no necessary is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was culminent while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for the second time in the hospital for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts to his handicraft, which he suffered during the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted for murder after an appeal of the prosecutors against a first dead belt.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed steak in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on it.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night insistence that was hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell which they say, she was very opaque.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The prosecution authorities said that they would raise up the Supreme Court of South Africa with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2468">Afterwards, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken ance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockles, who bore the cylinder around the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Eagle stands for integration, said school teacher Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">Indeed, the young is different from the other kittens (chicks), but e.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system such as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, could be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, caused magnets, recurring or bloodations, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferers normally, meat and dairy products are advised to avoid their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that promote the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes to hide themselves in the body do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells which are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium becomes too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in a anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has found that a type of tolerance-promoting immuncell in mice is present, which bear a certain bacterium in their initiation.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium is needed tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus Crucii - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan saw the mice in their food, the more they had the immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan is tolerated, less anti-inflammatory intestinal herbs, if the same system obstructs even with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctor in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barrada visited a kind of immuncell who found the tolerance when it found out that a group of study powers found such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, but that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference between the intestinal microbiosis of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which live normally in the stomach-intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenzas and it were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacked mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so that a gut microbiom was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were created the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system, the researchers seized L. reuteri and caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerable deposits.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component has been cleaned out of liquid, it turned out to be a side product of Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as the Indol-3-milk acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have tolerate the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri to our stomach-intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-based products from L. reuteri develop the cells of people as such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopical values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an expansion of these population. "</seg>

<seg id="2863">Has the PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga enjoys her interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave its persecution of Neymar, after they had given an offer of £189 million in order to trigger its freeways, but have warned them over three years before the world attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has set the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the completion of Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is livid above the way that Neymar has forced its way to outside, although a source has always been a source near the Catalan executive board, that the club has always been given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned by the PSG president three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi negotiated a strict warning for each club to sign up one of the best players from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they don't want to touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign up one of our players, then this will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed the line, with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer's interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti express.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to go to any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest in which they lost one of their prize offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Dominion report entertet Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">"" "" "" "the Regensburger" "" "salvation report on the abuse of abuse," "" "Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse at Regensburger Domo atzen is continuing to offer discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesman of the Reunification, "We are Church," explained after publication against the German press agency, he acquired by the former Regenser Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, and of the Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the respect of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would have their deepest submercies over own subomissions or their time false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican News" Osservatore Romano "" "," on the other hand, criticised that the "" "" two measures "" "" was measured in reporting on violence. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2895">In reference to the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be punished by "dirty and humane acts," so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that is intended for normal" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Principally in Gloria of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk's interview: "you like to go on to the church and that's a great fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in her youth," "" "in her youth," "" "blows a very normal educational means" "" "to be ready to become ready." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They dig themselves unfair, today standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports over the abuse of abuse, Pope John Ratzinger also appeared in connection with the reports.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Wrong to wrong, author and historians Michael Hemann, who was written with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of the Pope." (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440 page report, presented by the Secretary of the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment of attorney at law Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausivity "victims of overprint, 67 Domestic atzen were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">At the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarize the fact that by Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even in case of very high emotion, the punishment of the students could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, contrary to many other authorities, many victims of general humanity falls of R. rated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are connected with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hemann, why the final report of abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger declared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440 pages report on the "Precipation of Violation of Violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For an uplifting many students, he revealed his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as cholesterol and Perfecter, who became the öfteren when a Domspy brought musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you find this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hemann: if you make the effort to read and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask for why the name Georg Ratzinger is ever ahead of it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly suspicious from any suspicion of the mediator or co-breeding in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence at the pre-school events occurred outside of its activity-sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can be irrelevant to him, from it to late, or first evidence to have taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Dominion grammar school, in which he worked, was considered to be" "" "redemption," "", "heaven and" "" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his students" Georg Ratzinger also describes it as "warm" "", "very popular" "", "very well-good teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and has always been surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its Perfectism and its high emotion that led to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't just cast it with chairs and cast the key Federation on the ground, but also put earnest on the hair, or ears, he has already admitted even before years, deeply saddened and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it must be said to his honour, however, such corrective methods in the fractance time, the 1960s and 1970s, have been widespread, with parents as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know also such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what about it actually comes in this report, namely the dearable sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, these are certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is no matter if you do not seem to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI's brother, that many media has just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report it was reported very much about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report even some processing or collaborative with regard to sexual abuse on load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted to the cathedral champion.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I've never comforted myself, with my father or my mother," "" "said one affected of understanding for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, however, is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust their parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral conductor, who had been a colleague to have been a colleague of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we rate Ratzinger Patzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a fragmentary student formulated it so: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no event, in which he was reckoned (Georg Ratzinger), and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd to accept that... Buben intrude or clearer or more clearly opened, than compared to their parents, internators, confidentists, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that one speaks with him about sex.... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">This is how the report comes to the very clear result: "that, in the lead of affected people and / or their environment, he could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of charge of every fellow abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictions in connection, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "violence exams" in the case of regiments.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger is accused of having responded" "" "the previous domain name" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this incident?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting it all mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It will be clean separately: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral atzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report reports from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger did not have choral manager of the cathedral state.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible investigational education, the cases where boys from seasonal teachers were correct and malarled and maleably, occurred all on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skillous states must have been prevailing.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Dominion grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On it was, like most witnesses, the topic "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You only was happy to be disable and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the Dominion grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there was already discipline there, but no savorous violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims of humanity by R. rated and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the pre-tending, have to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and took up the predecessor at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) would not hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Opened Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dominion grammar school, which the report is even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out to this point," "" "that in the pre-school the testing was still practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already, in view of the danger of negative pressions, he might seem to reach the result.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course, of course, in fact, as a legal clarity, was already banned in Bavaria in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it occurred in a legal grey zone, just like everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">This was too difficult for him, where people may be exaggerated or drafted and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say too, he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed to be unfair, use today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we historians talk about the case of "Falluck of Anachronism," which is the risk of evaluating today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of course for sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school law and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all quite dreadful and I'm glad that it is finally processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funding to the disciplines and puncture, so craven and to pull the hair and ears, were widespread far in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is then forbidden, he also has kept himself to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of its Regensburger era has George Ratzinger in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing was also used for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hemann: now, in the book, I am talking about his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI's life, says from his perspective, as they played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't miss it, that he was a striped regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said to be said: without these perfect discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Welfare, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you do not have a great singer and before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger from the discussions with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hemann: thanks to his work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, delicate and hearted people, from which one can't imagine that he could not be able to do anything in one fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm travelling regularly with how many former Domestic atzen is still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, reading him, he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not been given to him today that he was strictly strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestic atzen are now thankful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always became a good, good teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a loving respect to respect, to whom they are still looking at today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, at once again clearly: everything that has been prethed to him are legal methods that were at that time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominent and one even more prominent brother to make the media goat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is an evil intention that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now it would be responsible for a 93-year-old man who had acquired large services, and without which outside of Bavaria, and perhaps there's probably no one that nobody wants to know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
