gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ des
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf teacher in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety of colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alls the horse &apos;s opening night , they pursued the fast Gal@@ opp home to the feeding @-@ feed .
a kilometer at this pace I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ ri@@ an arri@@ es then ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he did not lead himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t catch a photo of pictures .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus also with Chi@@ o .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
in the context of a small gala , the German sports aid gave the Golden sports pyramid .
there are no lack of awards for the pleasant sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver @-@ bay leaf , champion @-@ tour of the year ...
even the British Queen has already en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
long is the 18th award winner of the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ es .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means to me very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been promoting young people for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 further outstanding sports athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. ma@@ ers@@ lau@@ er was taken up on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
the nom@@ inees are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ls and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ke , the Ru@@ iz Peter W@@ ien@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank W@@ ien@@ e@@ ke , the jumping home Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - that want both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
however , un@@ one are the two U.S. Presi@@ den@@ bers in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosop@@ hi@@ cal difference .
it is about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regul@@ ating regulations .
Clinton to overthrow the economy and regulate the economy to death , he says .
by contrast , he would be different , asser@@ ted tr@@ ump .
he will re@@ distribute regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax principles - for private professionals and for companies .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has given discrimination , and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in which he has to be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost like the same .
the democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
public investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ u@@ sian Te@@ x@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , on tr@@ ump , then the internal discussions could be coming .
the differences in the energy and climate policy are interpreted .
tr@@ ump intends to build coal @-@ fired power plants and return to the US in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil promotion is likely to be possible in the protected areas with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate change agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to expand its investment program with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - including international trade agreements , the two compet@@ itor are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ ose @-@ fish agreement , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both the US do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade , but simply protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which should then be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump is going to do in this question is not really clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushing , then he doesn &apos;t be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him before , that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be higher .
on the other hand , Clinton is looking at least from the rich they want to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every sophisticated woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who will flee to their own daily life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he gaz@@ ed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ ved on the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is part @-@ Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare offers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are ge@@ ared .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all@@ otted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women &apos;s aid .
it was officially opened and officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here has made on their way experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because torture or death thre@@ aten them , because their families will send them to Europe as a hopes to Europe . &quot;
in women , different reasons for escape : &quot; many are ste@@ aling secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in her native country they have experience with sexual violence , forced violence , honour , slavery , or forced prost@@ itution .
this is how it drives away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ g for example demand a bottle of water a sexual intercourse is not a rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women alone are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here , too , women in refugees would often considered as infer@@ ior to be considered as infer@@ ior and mis@@ erable if mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in Munich , are traum@@ ati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children have not been voluntary . &quot;
there are so many women to say that they are nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trust not to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help you need more accommodation only for them , please call B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District parties in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they are from a similar project like in Munich in her jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and the Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in the governments of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben , there were no less separated women alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press conference of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower Saxony and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are rooms in some common floors or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central properties available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of the women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published in the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be home separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women and women are gathered together , there may be a contin@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
above all , the rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel that the need of these protective needs , you can read the score , which there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spoken that there is a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assist@@ ants strike : claims to new working temperature
Deputy Chairman of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) required his entire Council to appro@@ ve more working environment from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it was a minister , that it was necessary to worry about the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance and media inst@@ ants have agreed in July on the ref@@ usal of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained peace@@ fully quietly , which led to that the treaty was rejected .
she said , &quot; In view of what has the J@@ DC executive board voted to reject the proposed new contract and calls for the official negotiations for all ages . &quot;
as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC executive board has set up a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of working activity , which begins in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance from this year was six times , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , resigned after the election of the agreed contract conditions that were advised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance and medi@@ ti@@ inst@@ ants , that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
according to the vote , the Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for Do@@ ctors in England was forced to be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and to announce the official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish defender in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Palace in receiving me , I can not be denied the impression that Ankara wants to prop@@ iti@@ ze the reconciliation of reconciliation .
there was the rash , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked nar@@ row@@ ly , and he om@@ itted it with heat , even for his rec@@ ital conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day is a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so far as would never happen to be something worse .
to me , his enthusiasts seemed rather to interpret the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that he had not forgotten Russia &apos;s state of Russia .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his admission : the shooting of a Russian campaign for the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow in response to the time was w@@ ut@@ edly burned .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , because it was celebrated by a for@@ ged friend .
it is difficult to build up again , if not even impossible to be impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fer@@ oci@@ ous , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time the Turks seemed to bear all the bl@@ ame .
on the serious , the alle@@ g@@ ations of senior officials admitted that Earth &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he did this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally this meeting took place therefore , because Putin received the President of the President of the Republic of Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear in hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan run on the first line of all the friends that he can get after he was almost wiped out last month with a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again , terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there is also commercial motives .
Russian sanctions imposed Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number of employees decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel organizers and char@@ gers will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on one late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week , the State Television forecast its budget fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is li@@ vid to the west because it was the response to the tried power in response to power .
to achieve this , the persistent g@@ roll over the accession negotiations for accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ pi@@ ety is to draw out the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded in Ankara with a claim that he demanded the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the chosen state organs .
that is a matter of Moscow . this is a matter of self @-@ intelli@@ gible , which gave himself a pro@@ found fear of rain .
the summit in this magnificent palace along the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Policy : &quot; two countries who reject the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently given the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support additional parties .
it could be characteristic that after almost three hours of the first discussion on the press conference , they said that they could not have under@@ gone the topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey missed it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when the NATO member of Turkey oss the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of states are at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the board of Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared by the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand has been connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since been dist@@ ressed , when they were almost rab@@ ies , and had to be saved eight years ago .
in this period , Tra@@ at@@ egen , &quot; R@@ BS , &quot; have used to protect other end power marks .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to the Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to press more national stamps to the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and its IPO , are changing to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller stamps for private clients that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WA@@ N was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be dealing with our investment brand as well as to the brand , among which our employees will be busy , since we are now more to be a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank was used for a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not track these goals , but follow local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different from their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work with the customer among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his Sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of the brands , as we have asked ourselves in the inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for clients ? &quot; the Board of Staff said .
it would have been quite cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launched these brands , therefore I think that the time is come .

D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th winnings
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at the market for New@@ market .

the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he is followed by Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pigments , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ year winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about that it is at the end of New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ jo Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am ligh@@ tened and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bel on , when he brings the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a combined career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ s , the nineteenth @-@ painted D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ bu@@ ck@@ ering .
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern era and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , which only reached a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusi@@ ast@@ ically enthusi@@ ast@@ ically enthusi@@ ast@@ ically for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago in Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 winnings , if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ children !
Frank@@ ie has already been winning almost 30 years winner , which is great .
he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition it is an incredible yo@@ ckey course .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone in a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the British flat @-@ name for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole range of big tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glorious seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot , but he survived a plane crash and received a drug b@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive strength to bra@@ zen its bi@@ kers and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once told that he wants to continue playing in competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ 5@@ s .
Russia &apos;s over@@ priced Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin fired un@@ expect@@ edly for his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a many years part of the closest confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport operations .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin was arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ dial@@ ect . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
he was born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn , completing his degree at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became protocol managers and Chief Leader of the governing death .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Chief of Staff to the Law and inspec@@ tions for the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov asked his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made myst@@ eries .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ sts in Vladimir Putin and works as he is responsible for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast@@ ed on TV , both men said that his Chief of Staff enters on his own request .
but despite a smile for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a kind of power ?
nobody knows that .
but the official statement - that a man who once was employed as potential President , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large sk@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you to talk about this very complex post in the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compla@@ ined items for four years .
like it out , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ dial@@ ect for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin is a former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was named Ivan@@ ov appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in most .
once more , Ivan@@ ov was supposed to be President of Russia after the second term of office , as a third term of Putin was going to reject the Constitution .
but this post was taken from another , close allies of Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he defeated producers
Gibson was involved in a physical activity on the set of series in Los Angeles in last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common opinion , its cancellation .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly traded on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation publicly .

Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ se with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ clu@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the completion of the bridge is close to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge phase of Fi@@ fe is 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tubes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs K@@ eith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go down from the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ se .
we are all witnesses of a engineering sector in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is an hei@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the entire Br@@ ück@@ ent@@ cks are located at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks , today in Ros@@ y@@ th gets a bedding for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to reach its place at the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure of the construction of the construction and deep structure represents .
after installing the last road section and the connection with which in the expansion of the northern top @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap to the North or the map .
this has been reached south by pulling @-@ up of 700 millimetres in the south .
this was a massive and very heated operation .
massi@@ vely because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at a gradient of approximately 3 % .
hei@@ fer , because the tolerances of the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have a fortune to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ ck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from the fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned out about itself and introduced us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; than@@ k@@ fully , the strong winds have already stopped off the boat instead of their range , until we were added to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found in a boat without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal area and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ ned and yet to be alive .
while the boat engine had an emergency post , however , the boat delivered to the boiler from the person who ste@@ ered the boat contributed .
someone has awak@@ ened today over those men .
heavy injured - man pi@@ ke on his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get the apartment for getting his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic k@@ iller cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
when he came to the tabernacle , he woke up twice in her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old were injured by the hand and the body .
the police could strengthen the perpet@@ rator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed became their sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the tabernacle .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the road , they met the ex @-@ life of the man .
as the two women revol@@ ted the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend .
who builds brown silent apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should have taken much stronger into the duty in future .
how will you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; manual concept &quot; in front of the next rat@@ chet .
but dispute is programmed .
first line is about the question : who should actually build the convenient apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
Christoph Fr@@ mann says : &quot; we are interested in the Gre@@ ens with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all homes have to show as social flats . &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
the great dispute in the town hall is , however , the viol@@ inist : &quot; how are you going to sell to investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want that investors on such surfaces are at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the homes as social flats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential building package that will cost millions of costs and has to be financed , shall ensure an inc@@ enti@@ ves for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , as Viola : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ ptions as possible .
the Left wants to have a hardness of hardness for investors .
regardless of what , viol@@ inist , the flag of the situation in the housing market is un@@ noticed .
the action concept will be implemented , that will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff will be needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we are getting the skilled workers .
but the program does not stand completely , because the 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built @-@ in .
but how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 favorable apartments whose funding will be exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by the year 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plan@@ ation of spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , it would have to be remembered , apartments return back to the price @-@ binding .
this is possible in the western city .
then let the problem be solved .
because in the western city , at the end of the year , they walk from the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments , one could get there into the price list for cheap apartments .
only : this would not want the owners , the residential building companies do not want .
the number of public dwellings in the West@@ stadt will again be dra@@ stically further increased from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing .
it should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few city parts .
the Green Party will make sure that there will be a move in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to move to the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that I concentrated on more buildings for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that no com@@ promises can be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with it , on screens at the last decade of many be@@ mo@@ ans .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , people are going to fetch people from the sofa and be active .
the time at the screen was at the beginning of TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not able to exclu@@ de each other .
I am talking of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which first were created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it became a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of popular culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand early July something .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than an adult and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go to their smartphone with their smartphone , looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who were followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which defines the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users who followed by Washington Post recently agreed that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of people going to train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for increased performance .
many public asc@@ ension campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes of time to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; launched every day , &quot; beat down ears because many public emb@@ assi@@ es are getting bor@@ ing and of people who look like .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be judged .
those who are led regularly sports , reduces his chances of cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to introduce it here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring to do something in the outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close up new friends on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ et@@ ric gam@@ ble , which must always be harder to compla@@ in .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already could follow our activity earlier , they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new one will lose its appeal and the use is ref@@ illed with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that can be linked to apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ned
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the immune system .
dynamic on the trampoline @-@ horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on all the line brilliant .
and now at last the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multi @-@ campaign titles and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 clearly was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ard@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es can be found on the Swedish beam during the single multi @-@ year campaign during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American woman , winning a multi @-@ campaign titles and a total of the fifth , while holding their reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at that moment .
this success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought up their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ ly dominated their sports field , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou rescue from her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between it and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not being returned with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ce them , having each of gold and silver in the single multi @-@ level race course of women in the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ ly , the first Medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party was ordained into retirement in his retirement in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although Bil@@ ly existed on it , during their long driving on the top , never the future , it is not really true .
a part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical tumor passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip in the g@@ ymnasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 she has no more lost multi @-@ combat competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will be as long as it wishes .
also when Must@@ afa was slightly led by two rotary h@@ ings , the picture hat@@ ched .
pig @-@ beams and vap@@ ours - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lu@@ sted .
again , she caught up again with 15.@@ 433 again on the Swedish bar - and placed on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her - a pure form@@ ality - a pure form@@ ality - and tears in Bil@@ ly shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collective book , to reality .
the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when they fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ chapel mentioned by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; had a lead .
after their soil exercise , they threw the audience to the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ y , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared to doubt .
in the beginning of this week , the beginning of this week the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series dec@@ ay in the car shot at the car .
according to police reports , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first production fall of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked by the authorities .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand@@ ing fire@@ weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is reading in the report .
the Police showed that the triple murder did not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ure , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were in possession of an adult victims .
the poli@@ ze@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ator to become a near@@ er view if they are associated with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in h@@ isp@@ anic residential areas were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard Al@@ man@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and were committed by the same murderer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting down , which led to an empty pick@@ up truck by half an hour before the triple of murder and from the assumed that it was the work of a series of co@@ ders .
investigations were found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ancing and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ balance : &quot; it will be better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of its aging , Edmund Mikro@@ co@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic distur@@ b@@ ance , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create it not .
I do not create it .
I left myself not left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course they left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she will never recognize them under certain circumstances , and he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to seek him .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with the help of a hearing aid .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year , neither can he speak yet .
but he slowly making progress .
he can run with support and drive bike .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the string language that Edmund for &quot; Please &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sing something before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we make a sign language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS news .
but it is not a typical sign language - says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro @-@ infection has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses like mas@@ ons or the Z@@ ik@@ ca@@ rus of pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of infected with the ic@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remember the emotional price of a terrible future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a long time since a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless rating for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ ca@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and you will love your child .
severe rain accidents , floo@@ ding and cause to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
severe floo@@ ding and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to proclaim the not@@ ation on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned throughout the Saturday with more rainy rain .

the governor of Louis@@ iana John Bon Edwards told that public officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and aid to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness to the governor , shared the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand sa@@ ws .
Ste@@ ele said that alone in the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand@@ bags had been requested .
a flood control system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service didn &apos;t stop that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall on rain in this area .
on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ early war@@ n system was deployed in the south of Alab@@ ama , while it rained in the Mobile border .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are reaching a record level during the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flooded many houses near the Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream , floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger since it is only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level on Friday at the beginning of Friday at 09.00 .
rescue Team will still get people from the rivers to the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson , in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among the ones saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , that is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rising strongly by night .
he said that another step@@ son , who dwells in the vicinity , had warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are w@@ aking up and po@@ uring the water and po@@ uring in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she had never seen such a flood of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ ial had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were up to Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was rapidly increased , as there were still severe rain accidents and so that the authorities continue to consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was put in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably more violent since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rainf@@ alls and tr@@ ams flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary transmitter WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded homes .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were completely over@@ flooded .
the rulers of the congregation of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities could have saved 72 people and seven pets saved by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , Not@@ ices were set up , in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to return , they will return back to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding and du@@ ck for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems like a similar incident .
the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison of Count@@ ess said that it rained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses should be reported on Thursday at Thursday , but on Friday we have not been reported .
K@@ eith Town@@ son , manager at Sh@@ op@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered multiple injuries violations , including in the le@@ aning , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at his transportation to hospital with consciousness .
&quot; he has made a lot . his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boys of the boy distributed the transmitter to that it is likely to recover .
he would have supposed to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four persons who were shot in German@@ town .
also three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was located on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police had just determined whether one of the injured men &apos;s perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators shared the C@@ BS Philadelphia , that it seems to have come to a cruci@@ fix@@ ion between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ en@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ f@@ les , which were tra@@ cked down to various assault ri@@ f@@ les , were overcome the tat@@ too .
it seems that it is clearly acted for a prolonged battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walking trail , they were located .
thus , several armed fighters seems to have been involved , who participated in very actively , &quot; shared police Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no for@@ ti@@ fications and the police reviewed reports , according to the surveillance video surveillance .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was taken by a qu@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West Oak Lan@@ e .
they re@@ covers and the police search for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I wanted to do with the Women &apos;s Olympic team in the Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s more than a reason .
first of all , I have been in the summer of 1984 for every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Madison Ko@@ cian , Cath@@ o@@ lics , complete , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has noted the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the tip of this sport @-@ art .
in the last four years number one was one of the female g@@ ymn@@ ast a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a great Olympic winner in and America .
now the world was able to be a witness of the unbelievable performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as it was unexpected , but master@@ ly @-@ known Gy@@ ma@@ she@@ er rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American woman who won gold for women with an individual multi @-@ ring event .
Mann@@ a member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but so we don &apos;t see classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four g@@ ymn@@ asts of the team . furthermore , she is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sports and Turner first combined in private turn@@ tables that are per@@ ished for their training , educational and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be adjusted arbit@@ r@@ ary .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are lying in a wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the Turner will receive its entire training and that &apos;s a long lasting long term for families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have joined both their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ ner .
we have to in@@ spect the municipalities of Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an accessible and easy access training .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
in my events we have prepared free and affordable tur@@ ner in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth up high @-@ quality tur@@ keys that earn the opportunity to learn from this amazing olymp@@ ic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops starch , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ mo@@ il and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team of team and thank you for so many young girls with a different background motivated to become a healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance of assistance would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to stop the dispute with the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who voted upon him .
in July , Hunt plans have unveiled the Treaty establishing the Treaty establishing the N@@ HS in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to every other delay for employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which also includes changes to night and weekend to improve the care times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Comet for assistance , divided the last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ent concerns about serious concerns , in particular that there is to heat the current staff crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors have fallen under the new contract , progress has to be made , and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A will take part in the solution of the discussions with the government to participate in the government and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ic silence .
this happened after the speaking , Jerem@@ y Hunt last month for the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , lifting up the penet@@ ration and the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ent has made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last Strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 sched@@ ules , since n@@ urses and specialist doctors have been involved in order to grant physicians to strike .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to stop the dispute with the adoption of the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week@@ day wage for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance of assistance to end the strike .
Mor@@ tim@@ ers said : &quot; working temperature measures do not achieve a little bit , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , care and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the commission@@ er of the assistance of assistance , and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries positi@@ vely to concerns about the concerns as regards gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ars .
the employer hop@@ ed that the ongoing positive commitment to other important issues - how to return , flexibility at training courses , training courses for those who were from a professional career , training courses , health Education and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medication that can lower heart attacks to heart rate
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being recommended by the authorities to adopt this more people for a longer period of time .
the inner medicine t@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation is recommended to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation is recommended to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
every year about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of these suffer a heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by the fet@@ us material in the arter@@ ies of arter@@ ies , which form the pads .
if the layer breaks out , it may cause a blo@@ od@@ or , causing the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood pressure is dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood stream and hide the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , will have a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ il@@ ani and is distributed under the trade name of Br@@ illi@@ que , reduces this risk by taking the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the trial design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of A@@ spir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ols Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE healthcare providers , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ical consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively reduce the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . gui@@ ding design recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of the mar@@ g@@ inal ness , suff@@ ice to blos@@ som in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets , Rah@@ man was born last year on the mis@@ sal of a government report for corruption from the Office
a culture of the mar@@ g@@ inal path@@ ness has led to that the widespread campaign was ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating governmental report today .
the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es interven@@ es the police , pol@@ ishing observ@@ ance and Rath@@ geber in order to have evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitive to eth@@ nia and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al government , which is now a Ant@@ corrupt index of religious motives that it should be so bad that it should be allowed to establish the police outside of elec@@ tr@@ ines outside of voting cabins to protect voters outside of elec@@ toral voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity in the elections to prove their identity .
at the moment a voters must only call his name and address .
the report proposes , not remote ink on the finger of a person if they leave their elec@@ toral vote to prevent anyone who cho@@ oses twice .
Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , Sir Eric .
he calls for that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non official charges or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only the elec@@ toral law , but it should also protect the municipal authorities in front of the wider corruption and funding of finance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election as in the East of London .
last year , a special voting court decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor of Rah@@ man should be on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had caused his critics to silence , and had caused his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ rel@@ ous obligation of Muslims was to choose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt or the consequence of a rep@@ lica when one person sel@@ ects another .
Sir Eric said that it was the whole country of evidence for fr@@ aud .
in particular , he expressed especially al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - at the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ ck the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ yer of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof , it was appropriate that pressure on protective requirements of some ethnic minority was administered , in particular women and young people in order to elect according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or b@@ ang@@ ka background , in particular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a conduct regarding &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ a@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ nia and religion could be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to su@@ ck the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist papers are processing to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harvest@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , also demands harder registration tests to prevent the election directory on immigration and social research purposes .
options to consider , voters in front of the choice after your identification card .
non @-@ remote ink on the finger of one person , once they are given their voice to prevent anyone who cho@@ oses twice .
system@@ ic checks of the nationality of a person to make sure they are entitled .
a three year old limitation on applications to an automatic mail@@ box .
the ban on political activ@@ ist and envel@@ opes from envel@@ opes .
the police put the authority of setting up the police stations .
a change in law , which facilit@@ ated an indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Liberation Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing for@@ b@@ ade in turn@@ out stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the workout , in order to ensure that the employees make the rule through that voters go on the bal@@ lot alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no complaint was set .
&quot; the Ele@@ ctor Tribunal held Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ igation on corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ ou@@ ched , &quot; he said .
he was sufficiently known due to a series of reasons for insufficient - according to the high demands in the criminal procedure .
he will also criti@@ ci@@ zed the effective &quot; cancellation control &quot; of the Austrian authorities .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tribunal in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country carries as the mother of Parliament a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of pol@@ ar@@ ities and leu@@ k@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ viol@@ inist and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympi@@ as@@ mo@@ ists in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are this week beyond the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from edge and band , which proved to be impressive as a prestigious leader of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far not the only one to meet gold fighting athl@@ ete , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists on Olymp@@ ion@@ ic , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood screen .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : Mann@@ a member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
except K@@ ates double @-@ law on the wheel railway , a lot of people represented on the Internet how a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght of Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher@@ y got the ma@@ dness in the social media , and gave it to hear that he had already heard in his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity , except the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with exception .
&quot; it is a good looking cher@@ y , so I hate this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will doubt be the focus of this year : the obvious simil@@ arity between the British wide spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is to go through as a double @-@ way for Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .

another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips alike .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ wound skin and bl@@ on@@ ating hairs like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan departed from fans , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; was like .

not only the only thing : one Twitter user was very happy about that other the simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen

a Twitter user expressed its satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m away .

the criti@@ que of Byron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s Twitter came quickly and hard with which many of them presented to him .
Twitter users had not kept back when they heard how the sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who was moderate to the C@@ BC show , was broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , so sorry , it is happening . &quot;
at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC was at the end of the people who have responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator@@ ian Scott Rus@@ sel had to be called in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC head and killed its exc@@ use with more than 90 other Twitter U@@ sers , who compla@@ ined about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network was also completed quickly and gave a message .
we regre@@ ts it properly that these statements have been made , and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we spent yesterday night quickly with our viewers on the show and our followers in social media .
in order to clari@@ fy , B@@ yr@@ ons Responses related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . it does what he had said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald finally landed in the show and tried to just@@ ify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ eping process in the C@@ BC Olympic turn , he said .
&quot; I found myself on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no Mis@@ sing was inten@@ tional , and I felt very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark passed through woman , tried in the middle of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went out of her clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ sen@@ ate the situation , he numbered them , as they looked in it , and put them back into the shelf .

Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before she laid her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son who had found themselves at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buy something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , a pair of tro@@ users came out of the outlet , withdrew their own strings and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just standing there as O@@ skar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone was stub@@ born when she withdrew the sub@@ mer@@ cies , which you did not like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more sub@@ ways before she finally decided that you did nothing right again and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed not to distur@@ b that she observed someone or more about the person who wanted to buy them in circumstances that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would like to take home to anyone who had an additional person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the clothes pieces from the sale after she went - what is the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ ways to find out and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t have been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the case that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before tru@@ ce
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Po@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers near the distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front , or from the back , this video will show you how to turn off the sk@@ e@@ wers to the sk@@ e@@ wers .
if you ins@@ om@@ itted from the back , you should be turned out to see your att@@ ack@@ ers , so that you will proceed from the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take a weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with the knees , and turn off , while the att@@ ack@@ ers turn into pain together , the weapon from his hands . beat him on the face and move back , while they move the weapon on him .
in att@@ ack@@ ers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the Line of Line , take the weapon and dis@@ close them , so the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
in the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his hand , before they move forward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ pe@@ chi .
but remember that it is with a prey in the saf@@ est , to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Grand@@ master Grand Master .
guide Ian Wright s@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the most polluted places of Europe
a British tour inter@@ cep@@ ted his immune system and dig@@ nit@@ aries of serious examination - by doing some of the most tast@@ ed and fastest places in Europe .
the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk wiped his train on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge on a draw toilet and a public telephone in Russia to present the resistance of its immune system .
in front of the object of each object , it used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show oneself for what he will let .
but the experiment that was titled &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was filmed and brought some surprising results of daylight .
the idea , ins@@ ing the dish@@ ins@@ ing head of a tow@@ ing toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely eradi@@ cated , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of int@@ est@@ inal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately we didn &apos;t leave what he le@@ aned , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its int@@ ms by moving through the world , as well as wonderful things .
from public transport to railway stations up to dish@@ w@@ ah@@ ns of toilets , the task was the immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the movie he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ammed water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the movie he was just entitled to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the output of the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry length is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop , after its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a less than 60
Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products V@@ ali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different locations such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the movie he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst that I have taken in a toilet , close to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not touch here because it is indoor here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products V@@ ali@@ o .
the company supports Mr. Wright with V@@ ali@@ o S@@ us , which includes both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of int@@ est@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
V@@ ali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating for watching , and at the same time explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ika .
we performed the crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through which we ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the meaning of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way for consumers .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he &apos;d have tast@@ ed some of the things that I have instructed him to le@@ ak , like the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , and others , in which this was quite hard .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty delic@@ ac@@ ies on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by V@@ ali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents were questioned with the well@@ being of stomach and int@@ est@@ inal bacteria and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .

when they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the residence co@@ operative which were property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were disp@@ at@@ ched holes , wood panels were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family have been transferred and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer rep@@ airing .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is thought to be considered a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is very happy and its reputation is it too .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the time and the police told that the terror was added to the family , street strug@@ gling with b@@ ans , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , and floods covered .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was at the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ gramm@@ es behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house which will be torn down under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
they have been done in the property where drugs have been traded in the past , they have torn wood panels .
neighbours therefore said they were fighting on the street , and the police had to be called regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated them and their partner this week non @-@ violent from the property after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer voluntarily .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ated by ligh@@ ten neighbors , saying that their lives were made to hell .
one spoke of : &quot; they thought about anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , wherever they are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ wal@@ bour@@ gh En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would like to cooperate with the local authorities to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the revised side of the common hall , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant must not see any responsibility for her behaviour and the family , since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered .
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I reck@@ on all the work that my team , the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that are cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information provided .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate a few neighbors , and conve@@ ys the message that ant@@ is@@ os@@ ene behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left back in one of the bedroom of the house after the delay of delay .
workers of the house administration will now need gar@@ land we@@ bs , which is surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as gu@@ ards , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine of money after having found the possession of a drug B in Commercial Register .
she claimed that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , Tan@@ ya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will see ten@@ ants , not stick to the assignment of the assignment .
Angela Cro@@ w shared by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the Del@@ og@@ ation will be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think about themselves without self @-@ sp@@ ans , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall , the police and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal off@@ ences , who continue to work with partners to protect our congregations .

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed a massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be pla@@ gued by massive concerns , even in traditionally the conservative Federal States .
Presi@@ dential candidate of the candidate of Donald Tr@@ ump was now weak@@ ening of his campaign campaign in the Republi@@ can Hof@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ track and sel@@ f@@ ist mul@@ berry is something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the race camp from the race , the doubts expressed his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he took up his familiar media .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ ches
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ US out of June , according to tr@@ ump , and its compet@@ itor of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ ates .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not at the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona will also apply in Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he had to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; exactly how I did so far . &quot;
and remember : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else , than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it did not survive for him on the end of grounds of political correc@@ t@@ ness , be so fine , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I turn back to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party tr@@ ump is alleged to asser@@ t funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better query values .
instead of that , the candidates of Repub@@ lic@@ ans will attack stronger among the arms .

a ken@@ ian function has informed that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given an urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this has been reported to the team @-@ management of Ken@@ ia &apos;s d@@ oping control units .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has chosen the IOC to provide information about the case in order to prevent his own investigation , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named it in the IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Julia .
with it a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is marked very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older Lady .
she remembers her lovers to her Lieb@@ knecht with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Mari@@ as &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore cle@@ ver , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; it re@@ sembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise to the opera @-@ singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is an immense more generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his bli@@ cks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece they are about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we have gone up the refugees at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are exactly the same today as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish municipality calcul@@ ates with mass deportation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises the Erdo@@ gan of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a period of tens of thousands of protection seeking from Turkey to Germany in short term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Chairman of the presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan after the attempt of a trial , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I re@@ iter@@ ated with tens of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the For@@ bidden City of Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had been covered by Kurdish bur@@ sts with criminal off@@ ences , 500,000 Kurds are laid up in Turkey on the flight .
after the failed coup attempt to sow and op@@ sy ethnic Turks .
many are going to begin in Europe when they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that there is a state that has produced refugees , in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff was targeted by the Syrian Arab in Kurdish Arab , but also in the cities of al@@ ev@@ ite towns .
thus , Erdo@@ gan would raise the out of the remaining Kurds in order to rise to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been cut off or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k who is also a member of CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff asked that the Federal Government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; against the Erdo@@ gan critics in Germany .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition .
the fire mark@@ edly as a quality pend@@ ants are destroyed teachers and other university graduates the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises the Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed caffeine , by the way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already introduced the biggest group of the political persecution recognised asylum in Germany before the coup .
on June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all cases have been authorised to be recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey you cannot find the war , poverty , or the violent lack .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by state side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go to Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it does &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : don &apos;t get your home in the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacation , the European Parliament approved the beginning of the year .
as long as far , it doesn &apos;t matter : summer holidays , heat and land no@@ uns - which is fair .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the voting rights are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are on the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so are not allowed to choose the country .
to do this , practical problems : in the vac@@ ations are hel@@ pers , fl@@ atten the posters , fl@@ yer fl@@ yers and to count them at the end of the vote , just ti@@ pping .
by September 4 , 2016 , the elec@@ toral and final day of the month , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over even for a campaign close to the people .
the hot phase when you can say it has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear him .
the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , is now in pol@@ ls behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting as strong new@@ com@@ ing al@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous vot@@ er campaign , one sees his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , distribut@@ ing ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ght a little with the people , like it also did his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor .
otherwise , past@@ oral care has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel bl@@ ame the gu@@ ilt at the blos@@ som of the Af@@ ak .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We &apos;re doing that &quot; I accelerates the rise of legal lists , which is now expected to cost the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Minister of the Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you take the wrong time at the right place .
she was invited to a major German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast by German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony were as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from the other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen to him .
otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ ounces largely on the usual parliamentary elections on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , that &apos;s how Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the union also has noted that in the country you have bo@@ ther@@ ed the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire for the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the green : in the times of the country hardly any available .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ toral campaign Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ reli@@ es is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you must go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game is , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in pol@@ ls , Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Mand@@ ate ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD already won 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , will be able to create the jump into the country &apos;s state .
they make a modern virtu@@ es from the holidays of time and lay their elec@@ toral campaign large on the internet .

B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blo@@ cking
in speed with which the B 27 has been renovated , there is nothing to know .
for the persons responsible for the construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. , and begin at about 20 pm , there is everywhere praise everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those have made everything quite soft , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is also no default .
the construction site was to be transferred to the south until the end of October to be completed by the end of October .
then the opposite is also responsible for the construction of the persons responsible for the establishment of accommodation stations .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday to the south , and the lock of the A@@ sper@@ g@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the transport through the village seems to be back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation management of Florian King .
the local residents of Bach@@ ke , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shots were looking for and rather than the signs to the Nav@@ i .
what is led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas are in stock .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality urged the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable acquisitions , &quot; says King that made himself a place on the spot .
two to three per minute has been injected .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 kilometers per hour at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site moved in , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the experts at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open to customers .
business people do not have to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation with them lead to sales in sales , everyone is asking to look through .
however , some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means for other firms , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum light drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the top , the local restaurants are located along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Kron@@ a , finds significant words .
this is threat@@ ening to exist .
not only him , but all of the restaurants were &quot; tough . &quot;
the customer was missing from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen und Rot@@ s@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover amounted to &quot; far above 50 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road is thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have been re@@ acts differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , whether it might be a financial compensation for otherwise of the advantages of the location on the B . now , they also have to carry out the dis@@ advantages caused by the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other rural districts , where such things were more generous .
G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , and it refers to the long history .
in fact , others can understand that other regular guests should now understand due to the complicated traffic feed less often .
if one can &apos;t drive there , it is also quite beautiful .
that his ancest@@ ral climate change after the end of the rehabilitation work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and bird @-@ flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction works on his customer for the biggest crisis that experienced his guest appearance in their long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that is already brutal .
constant shall be scre@@ wed in the name of terror attacks in law .
after the recent proposals , Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a status status with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all of that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the prop@@ eller .
all its suggestions may be legally reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security services .
you will not demand any one .
other , additional points would be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in it .
but as the minister of the minister , it was situated in the results and to a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère continued a little time , before he presents its conclusions for security in the republic .
but , however , the more extensive ones fall .
a lot has been announced , announced , announced that a new security authorities in order to take care of the bu@@ ck encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU directives to flight data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is not surprising as well .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals that had not been able to do with the SPD : he wants to show sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship in the German Pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream of the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kept this still for reasonable and challenge even nothing that has no opportunities for the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also .
some of them have partially in itself : he plans quick procedures for shifts and more possibilities for the disability of people in front of the deportation .
refugees who are brought to the country targeted by their smartphone in advance , are to expos@@ e their smartphone in advance and submit social media account for a security check .
in case of canc@@ ers for lon@@ ged asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than before - about such who commit pen@@ gu@@ ards or reject their papers to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally admitted .
man@@ ches has even been on @-@ break@@ er and can be open to questions .
and with some points - in the ine@@ treatment of Ged@@ ser , for example - the question arises : what does that actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not possible to imagine that the attack on Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in view of the high number of refugees , many people were wor@@ ried about safety .
and things that people do not pro@@ found@@ ly , let not go out even in constitu@@ ency times .
the inner security is extremely ind@@ ented in the focus .
first the attack in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the protection is great .
and yes , there are constitu@@ encies .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly present in the subject of internal security .
in recent days the two parties went up between the two parties .
only a battle against the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs will also demand a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also tired of a conc@@ iliation .
from a return of the double pass he has nothing .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
it is not meaning@@ ful , be sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners , and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partners to show itself .
there is some potential in it , which could make war .
however , the SPD already attempted to pro@@ filing the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once more in conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ite is still coming .
despite diesel applications , the delivery will rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it goes round .
in the return reaction there are vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest bus service can continue to achieve a plus in spite of the diesel version thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , VW jum@@ ped the core brand VW mainly in Western Europe and thus un@@ loaded the overall sales as that included in the Da@@ x @-@ listed company .
worldwide VW sold the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , sales of the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries were almost one sixth round deliveries .
the Chief of Chief of Staff Jur@@ gen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , above all on two sales days in Europe .
in addition , in some kind of core markets , the economic conditions &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; has been granted .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British government had stressed the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the exhaust outlets first es@@ cal@@ ated , there is also a decrease to a decrease .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles are produced .
from January to July , the Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler was able to move further up a sales strategy from January to July .
Volkswagen published 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops .
in the wake of the upgrade , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ upgrade of vehicles , it is possible to reduce fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus service has a &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee of the customer after re@@ arm@@ ament , but don &apos;t talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason of legal refin@@ ement .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen best@@ ows his German customers now a guarantee for diesel models .
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture .
the Ministry of Culture has been confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; VW has carried out the editions of my investig@@ ating commission and of the KBA . &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output after re@@ arm@@ ament does not take place , and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicles will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was in corporate business .
in the wide term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers will come back half a year after the upgrade , with a motor damage to a workshop , and this could cause the new software to do so even if the damage has nothing to do .
it is also important to avoid the customer interests that in any case of any other damages that nothing can do with the trouble @-@ sc@@ andal , as stated by means of any possible warran@@ ties , as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded from the future pen@@ alties in the future than the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ rupt@@ cy Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only for 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or local funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks talks about an accident and does not see it any signal : normal spar@@ k@@ ite would not be afraid to pay for their pig@@ gy suffer@@ ers . &quot;
on the bank , banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients on deposits over 100,000 euros on plaster or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; Paul said .
he has been working for ger@@ many times 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and that he could not resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ rupt@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t go for every million € &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will continue after the condem@@ nation principle .
cash simply was in the v@@ res of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would have much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four su@@ cks , I don &apos;t know the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank was Chief Financial Officer .
most of the clients would have understanding and changes to other assets .
only a few hi@@ kes to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone to wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works economically fe@@ a@@ sible permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks do therefore increase their fees for account , credit cards or credit instructions .
with pen@@ sions for deposits starting from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , the Managing Director of the banking Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I give it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a cliff that is sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for a problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free to keep money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund was founded in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
famous actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
currently , there are currently no other banks known to the co@@ operative association of Bavaria , &quot; says spokes@@ person Ernst .
the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to Neg@@ ative , is very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and it disp@@ leased the emig@@ ration of lawyers to the competition .

Dest@@ ination plates : who purchases hard sound panels ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you can make a comment on the comment , in order to over@@ sow him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ ak @-@ defects with r@@ ins@@ ults , this statement is directed by current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ formation of sound plates does not like to rely on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to greet the curi@@ osity of physical objects , but attributable to mid @-@ life nost@@ al@@ gic .
those who have purchased a record , are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely to increase .
it is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables only keep their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy this time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would walk through the camera , while I carry in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit before I stop , keep my hands and have some utmost importance as : &quot; so , let us throw us an immediate look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers have been resident - there is a handful of fully developed stores .
I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I say by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men &apos;s middle age , a woman probably around the 20 ) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask ?
&quot; I guess it says , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these sound panels , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I have not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them when he was sold and once sold to buy items as he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who buy s@@ lab@@ s , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and like to spend their time alone , and adds : &quot; I do not smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my sp@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback to purchase their old records again .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually have completed their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to purchase their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of a certain age in the annex@@ ing of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels ?
it takes only a few seconds into a shop such as Ph@@ on@@ ica in order to realize that sheet shops offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ ered inner city .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted an impulse to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med themselves from the digital world and would like to move the stability of the trusted plate cover , by objects and happ@@ ily watching ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ies .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector , so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed a staff of a turn@@ out stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pol@@ l of IC@@ M revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record still haven &apos;t listened to the last month .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , no turn@@ tables .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I would like a pil@@ es of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at So@@ unds of the Universe ( Number of result : three men &apos;s middle age ) has noticed a &quot; Trophy aspect &quot; of the reverse aspect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently arrived here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I own no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio head record , that I can put them in shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music fiber .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are getting slowly .
pit@@ stop , which has devoted to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I am going to clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists , photos make photos , teenagers and women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , wild Be@@ asts of newest Syn@@ thes@@ izers and experts rather than by experiment from speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity to customers .
no one of them looks strange , but the mental trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed when you stand next to a length of 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes , and considered the vari@@ ability of the selling plates for sale .
it does not make a man@@ sp@@ ouse as a large one .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve much , therefore the collecting of sheets not real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a pleasant epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record players : Urban Out@@ f@@ ters .
while I give the ticket to mu@@ g the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants , I observed a group of young teenagers who group@@ ed themselves for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley plate player .
the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody can see it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of this , every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and some customers could find in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most of luxury objects like plates .
even if my re@@ research reports that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in plate shops in S@@ oh@@ o , who exist a large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , record shops and on@@ line@@ work .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not on board stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while using the rigid ga@@ ze of an un@@ fortun@@ ate , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator mei@@ er about the shoulders of any man &apos;s middle age .

French judge re@@ jects over demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp from
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants within the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in case of a trial on this week , the authorities argue that the state should be transferred to 72 temporary businesses within the camp goods , selling cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ ms , sell @-@ hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are ar@@ gued that these places should be broken down because they would not be paid a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and the risk of fire and the risk of fire .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups , did not offer sufficient foods for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have to offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 Pro@@ visional business but the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; absolutely re@@ tra@@ c@@ ably . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would be able to play a much bigger role than only people live , who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ ference terms . &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ating was the young Book Book Kids &apos; Café des bearing , which is meant well @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum items for hundreds of protection and un@@ accompanied minor in stock .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser needs to be adjusted to the next generation speed setting : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be higher effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting du@@ al tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on the auto@@ bahn construction or a sandy stretch with temporary temp@@ oral legs , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary aperture level for keeping the speed limit@@ ing .
a lasting mobile device can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ ark : his battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted service operation five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via multiple tracks .
variable speed limit@@ ing as well as driving through time to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer coupling .
so that it is not easy to cut , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the cl@@ um@@ bled wheels will disappear as well .
Moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ers from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , Tra@@ iler has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
foreign authorities also flashes with the new technology : recently , France created 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain over@@ hau@@ led silver in the 7 @-@ bit Ru@@ g@@ by , After Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ iod@@ ine stage in Rio .
Fiji granted a master class champion in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , landing , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad in each color .
the defeat was won by the non @-@ bad trophy of silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they were able to be able to do their efforts in this tournament in which they struck new Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall at it in the final .
but independent of it would have been killed in this form a 15 @-@ man @-@ team .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it probably will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path after itself .
eight years ago she lost her game under R@@ yan every game at the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one here .
this sli@@ der will we@@ h@@ do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonder@@ fully and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . at , as one would run in moving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went up in the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i played another attack from the right corner , which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly have the ball .
a he@@ avi@@ or T@@ ons of Mitchell stop the mountain of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only has shed .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ ford in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou rec@@ essed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , as the Fiji was born to play 7 , while GB still can be picked .
it is that way .
GB led the basic changes to half time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua came through to a brilli@@ ants inter@@ play from Fiji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the southern sulph@@ ur , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vil@@ i@@ ame put the i @-@ bag cap with another try in the last seconds .
the zip ert@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ arm@@ oured , and GB k@@ ick@@ ly defeated in the lawn .
earlier on the day they defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 . great Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ cely hit match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gateway to the post in the second half .
a brilliant tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 team , secured the prize - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more common gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 harsh h@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it were only the conf@@ essions who sat at the Ru@@ ins , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympics in a row without a tax @-@ woman in succession , the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ disputed use , which is also an exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who slides over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the type of Tri@@ umph@@ es of ge@@ ese .
behind each of gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ al@@ ion to inf@@ alli@@ sts that make the difference , and there was no more hil@@ ari@@ ous than the coach that would not survive this day before 30 months , when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky .
I had bla@@ dder cancer who can be oper@@ able and they did it .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a quite serious situation .
it &apos;s a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could begin treatment early 2014 , outside of the season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption was held at a minimum , in case that under such circumstances it is the right term .
I needed money , so I needed to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even larger .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve in the morning to talk a little more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the Captain of the Royal Art@@ illery reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated just how much that this means , how much that I and Helen and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would have no one , hence a massive Dan@@ ke on him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have a better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close together , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had to reserve a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something Tol@@ les .
we wanted to do today no fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
bell has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes here .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity :
the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian widely exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producer .
so it was in the origin@@ als of the Bavarian Radio Symphony in front of some time .
a little later , the Aquari@@ us of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia led the purpose .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer Group sailed to Bavarian as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been a workforce of 31 for two years , 28 years as managing director .
he was retired from retirement age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with head office in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes every year around 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and pillars with some 5500 inhabitants .
member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ stein , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman , broad@@ brun@@ ns Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water service and was appointed Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ve@@ yor Federation since 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , and they looked forward by the water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational employment , the budget Plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency approaches on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the sale of farmers in the area of the new fountain ( 1999 ) and the re@@ sign of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the parts of a central computer control unit ( 2004 ) and the parts of water lines .
there have been no breast@@ feeding and have always been recorded in new features because water and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ dati@@ o , she pra@@ ising G@@ öl@@ lers faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 years .
he has joined himself with a lot of heart blood for the water purpose and he has been living right on the water @-@ purpose association and it would be its own business .
a few weeks ago , he was a real intern@@ ship for the success story of the v@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Yo@@ unger , on the other hand praised Aquari@@ us Al@@ f@@ ons sem@@ bar@@ bel who had worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ dant , and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his view@@ point , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structured of the two .
but the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe bur@@ gl@@ ist at the can@@ ister there on a 3rd January .
here at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work through so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the power of Neu@@ brunn was only once more exciting , because you filled the can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who follow the successor to Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ rebellious ko deals with the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago around - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been diagnosed with her son , she believed that she must die .
but the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago would be well @-@ forward and now come privately in New York , where there is the best therap@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if I sang something about what two years ago , when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Net@@ rebellious ko said nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the most happy man on the earth .

alliance of Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - men shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( circle Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock and wounded them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and given to have shot his life in his brothers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the police reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator shall be on the run after him , after him openly .
meanwhile nationwide , since Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , mus@@ cul@@ ously and brown and has a gl@@ ass@@ ze .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
the man now carries a gl@@ ass@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could even bear the weapon of themselves , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship work . &quot;
the victims was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information to the T@@ ather@@ gang , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a k@@ illings of T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; we are currently unable to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one pol@@ ls of police in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , there was a special operational force ( SEK ) at the tat@@ too .
steel - Light of German steel industry
the k@@ ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared of additional costs in millions of millions .
the financial burden that threatened the industry from the eco @-@ energy promotion are from the table .
it shall remain in the liberation of the renewable energies of renewable energies in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to use steel producer , the gases coming from the high @-@ furnace power to power consumption for their own consumption , to checkout .
according to the German industry &apos;s industry , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certification with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators are replaced in steel plants , an EEG rate would fall by 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission to suit my own production .
so that the status Quo of the previous regulation will largely be noted .
special significance took the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the reform of emission and emissions are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continues to spread as the world &apos;s largest producers in China in view of the weak domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel concerts price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation became a little relaxed .
for one of the hands @-@ handed mer@@ cen@@ ary oil on import , the other economic prospects in China have gone up .
un@@ clear is how long the price over@@ h@@ aul is .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous in the Thursday .
last , the prices had more stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation of further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp has finally wanted to exclu@@ de Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp &apos;s last part of the work .
at the end of 2015 , about 8@@ 6.000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producer despite increasing prices and increasing orders will be careful .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced fewer than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Community in Friday .
after a short increase in May , the recovered lots now returned to the second consecutive month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
the association anticip@@ ates its increase in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
fellowship , Spirit , health : sing for seniors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her entire life : as young girls she was in school choir , studying music , she sings the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing Me - emotional and physically , &quot; explains it .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of living , says it .
on the next door , they do something good in their health and mind .
because singing is like a great hob@@ by , a great hob@@ by for seniors , tell a Erhard Hac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ ors League .
most seniors sing in the choir and sharing the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler .
through the regular co@@ hes@@ ion , seniors can link and maintain social contacts .
because frequently , social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in their choir : &quot; to arrange and organize yourself to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cont@@ our . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , believes Hac@@ kler .
for they train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
whoever demands his lung regularly , is not so fast in everyday life in everyday life .
even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
for elderly people often , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Government of senior organizations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher pitch , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
lu@@ ent often observed that singing or hearing of songs with older people raised many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and particularly melodies are sin@@ cer@@ ated by lyrics and especially melodies , even de@@ men@@ tia people go back to long @-@ lying events .
in the case , the head is also required for a particular performance , he explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , to focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live solely on , do not only pract@@ ise themselves to concentrate on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition they de@@ parts by the singing in chor@@ us , believes Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em also grows through the singing in the choir .
themselves to show yourself : if I take a bit for something , I will get better and awake through me - this experience is strengthened .
good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hob@@ by , should not hesitate to , even if he wants to have little talent , l@@ ent L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing it - at 50 singing people who hears it when a sound goes on it ?
in search of the matching offer , seniors have various possibilities , tell Hac@@ kler .
someone can join the world &apos;s degree in an old ench@@ ant@@ or , it can be simply connected .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs of the environment .
he who wants to sing in a church choir is able to move directly to the church or church leaders .
you can also find many seniors choirs as well .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask help with the internet connection .
if the desire has to sing , it should necessarily be connected to a choir , obli@@ t Hac@@ kler .
sing pra@@ ises to the soul , and has something fre@@ ien@@ des - this is true for every age .
cats react to sensitive as a cr@@ ater of the yo@@ ung@@ y
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the ruins of cat bab@@ ys has grown up to adult animals .
in their surprise , the male did not let the males make cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the revival rate of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on the mi@@ dd@@ est of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of k@@ itt@@ ens which are found in great distress such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the ruin of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ap of less and heavily damaged young are obviously not perc@@ ep@@ tible to the males , either not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; the Bi@@ ologist of Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study that was published in this Friday at the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ carp@@ ie with the ur@@ gency of their help is differenti@@ ated .
a total of nine adult male and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal holding of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a little ro@@ ar of little ones , which were separated from the throw box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings for three minutes .
on the other hand , they were confron@@ ted with the cry of stronger heads of k@@ itt@@ ens , which were elevated in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ ws .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted on the cri@@ es , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they rotated faster to the speaker , when this ru@@ ff@@ les played the very bitter k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or developed by sexually mature with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded to ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined several times in humans the reactions of women and men .
some studies also showed that women responded well to infants , as they were already mothers or did not report the Bi@@ olog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the one @-@ based football star hook .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important soccer game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the attempt in Turkey .
before the Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ riv@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
as early as the suspension of the exceptional attempt in July , the government , the daily routine that would not be affected by regular animals would not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected , to belong to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt .
but it is not made before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an South Africa , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant .
accordingly , in the meantime , South America living in America was accused of having a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ l@@ lah Gü@@ len shall be responsible for the trial of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
although it is initially valid for 90 days , it is still valid until October , in fact , that on the lives of most Turks , but as good as no impacts .
the time of democracy &quot; democracy &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared its territory on Wednesday on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into pend@@ ants and opponents of Earth .
especially fans of the workers club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not belong to the friends of the President .
however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the Turks became a ref@@ usal of military put@@ sch .
there &apos;s even the fans there - no matter whether you strikes the heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or b@@ ic@@ t@@ as .
with Pok@@ al@@ victorious &quot; Gala &quot; it will be back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
in its sporty value , Cologne exhibited in the past seasons : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ er him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in an outstanding way and secured the kno@@ ck@@ le from his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season was found out for a record champion .
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; make up early in the Europe League .
in the South of Li@@ g it was only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Be@@ ik@@ t@@ as ran the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which hit the base with 26 rounds of season as a sweet@@ per @-@ lift , the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez was held at the AC Florence under contract and announced that Gom@@ ez was announced , due to the attempt to return to the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club partner F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .

the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin had been closed twice because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ a in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led light athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh about - they are fighting in Rio at medals .
d@@ oping was determined as before the head@@ lines with the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swimming pool in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined after a d@@ oping lock her start shortly before playing , was un@@ locked and off with their start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ istic Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and was forced with its appearance .
as a festive , they did not get gold , the audience brake out in a Jubilee .
but there are still numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start in Rio at the Rio Olympics in spite of d@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athlet@@ ics .
he was locked to d@@ op@@ ings for two time ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since he sp@@ ell the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest ch@@ allenger from U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ painted Olympi@@ ad and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit in for a six @-@ month lock , after having been demonstrated the intake of the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defended , def@@ ending the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympic Champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 and tested positi@@ vely on the banned funds of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ad@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic fought the s@@ wis@@ ely taking and was locked in six months .
this year , the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters go to the account of the big golden f@@ avo@@ ids .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positive in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means to have been responsible for penis enlargement has been responsible .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is more than 200 and 400 metres far from the world to date .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ st@@ ole , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were detected as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 to nine years later , after a testosterone d@@ oping was determined .
furthermore , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 because of testosterone de@@ fle@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
due to a judgement of the 2008 Olympic Games CA@@ S , the bronze medal was also recognised by the 2008 Olympic Games .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked as two of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world @-@ world record and gold f@@ avo@@ ids was only positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion in the case of taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
bomb error in Thailand - Appe@@ al injured - multiple dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand arise with the woman in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas St@@ öl@@ l , Friday early .
they suffered cutting and be treated in the hospital , but I have already left them back in the hospital .
her home journey is planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also concerned , it is still un@@ clear .
in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands up in authority with local authorities , such as mer@@ cen@@ ary .
at about 200 kilometres south of the Bangkok city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs at the Thursday night .
according to the police , the police have been killed , killing some 20 people , including the Austrian and three Dutch , three Dutch and three Ital@@ ians .
Friday early then , two explo@@ iters went up , and again , according to the authorities , another man was killed .
also from Phu@@ ket was reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
the Det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ ar@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong has been violated by a taxi driver according to police data .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in front of the prec@@ inct , the explosion was gone into the air before the prec@@ inct of the prec@@ inct .
finally , there were more Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast there are several links .
one is going out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bombing of the bomb explo@@ res the same manuscript , &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai crit@@ eri@@ av@@ ee on Friday night before journalists .
&quot; we assume that there is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it was too early in order to sell themselves to possible motives - probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the proposals , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of mus@@ li@@ mic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , on the other hand , the Thai police declared that attacks are not related to Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
however , one rather go out that the bombs were laid down by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have received secret notes on the forth@@ coming days in the South of the country - however , they do not have been informed about the exact time and places .
he is still un@@ clear that group was behind the attacks .
the police rejected their civil servants throughout the country , the security around important government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ations , but they do not judge themselves against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Foreign Ministry is advis@@ able to ensure the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to ensure the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ vre and surroundings .
according to the conflict between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not necessary to take unnecessary trips in these provinces .
elevated safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the Constitution &apos;s military j@@ unta .
these have been in the military to influence great influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs had been an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos during the country in the direction of stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , believes themselves to have led the kingdom back stability and order .
however , the military has not been able to get to the military in the extreme south of the country , in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , Bangkok had been killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ pure 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody against the younger history of the country .
the rights &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is into the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several nation@@ alities , the constitu@@ ency of the Federation also have set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Against the Freedom Democratic Prin@@ ciples , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , they are subjected to Islamic faith or from the Ne@@ ar East in most extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns out against &quot; Mul@@ g@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through ex@@ ag@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional system in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has made the decision closely with the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are attemp@@ ting to catch their target group where she stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are generally trying to address them with young people , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
such Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a praying advertising for their own cause .
the prop@@ aganda is supposed to be emotional by the people .
young people are due in a particular way .
that is dangerous .
at last , there had been reports of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; related to Af@@ D policy in several federal states .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
on the constitutional protection of this type , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Mand@@ D - by certain people who are most extreme , their target direction changes and so most extreme .
thus , whether such people have ste@@ ered influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view of the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new terrorism in this context .
but we have found in the past few years that there can be legally characteristic structures .
there was a group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be quite true that other legal entities or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mes or attacks .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of rec@@ ster@@ ity ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
they ate , they ate that many attacks were on the account of people who had not entered the right scene in the world before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying thing .
many of the Tat@@ ars at attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders on the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many persons have committed offen@@ ders to have nothing on the hat , which might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but have become radi@@ cally radical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine Olymp@@ ion@@ ic risks or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te with the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he was not able to see any more in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was chosen .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return stand of 48 seconds and finished in 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his very sporting character , which moved the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old does participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special right away from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ presented countries .
as in A@@ th@@ op@@ ia most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes it ready for the big race .
the first sur@@ names had the round .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the same with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also moved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was responsible for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ ator@@ ial @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle himself .
fr@@ en@@ etically modified m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pl@@ ating pol@@ ling clothes not so tight
the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking to a elec@@ toral event in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election of the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he goes then to the holiday .
loses Donald Tr@@ ump will lose the US presidential election in November , it would be either open , or I have a very very nice , long holiday , &quot; the candidate of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said in a telephone interview with the US TV sen@@ ders CN@@ BC .
if it wasn &apos;t enough for him for the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , be this in order , said tr@@ ump .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , the last more resistance was formed .
post is entering the trade with electro @-@ transport
an electric vehicle of the German Post in Action .
the interest of other companies on the dead is obviously big .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Scooter .
in the near future , the Group will start trading with the transporter .
the Post plans to offer their electric motors from the next year as well as on the open car park .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go to third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checks for months , whether they are delivered to their own self @-@ developed le@@ vers with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell other businesses .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ an had said it &apos;s always asking questions , about by hand tools .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after information of the news magazine Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly ascend into mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post@@ own factory , the company has construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ber had previously announced that the Group would increase its fleet of electric cars with a long @-@ term change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we have to move the entire fleet .
since 2014 , the stri@@ ving Scooter has been active in Germany &apos;s roads .

the Head of Consumer Research G@@ f@@ K moves his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
indeed , the set@@ backs came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K showed that the Chair of Chairman of Staff Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more in@@ secure , the longer the success of his promised successes .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the G@@ f@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K business , each denom@@ ination is sometimes in@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were in the case of BMW the case , that would like to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

cr@@ ashes - Bus slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ eri@@ n in Gr@@ um@@ ens : eight injured
an accident of a travel agency with 43 senior citizens as passengers were injured and injured by eight people on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ am@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to provide their data to an even opposite to a carriage that drove off on the return railway .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench like a spokes@@ woman in the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the position of the bus they could not leave the bus self @-@ employed , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance wagons and an ambul@@ ances came to the accident on the national road 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ ellers have been brought back to the town centre P@@ ew@@ he@@ e by a bus bus .
there they should wait for a spare drive of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic meters of waste are available from 1 October 2016 to the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ is@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the A@@ endorf facility , the se@@ wage fee will be increased again at the latest , when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a covered @-@ day calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget of the budget was established by the estate and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that they run for these se@@ wage plants .
due to legal framework , the Market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities free of charge .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ is@@ ances , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , have to take deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee deposits are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Herbert Schmidt on the board of Management , Herbert Schmidt was necessary to re@@ apply the fees for se@@ wage plants in the market community .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 shall be over@@ - and / or sub@@ covers from the previous cycle period .
with a very low capacity utilization of approximately 6@@ 800 and 12,000 cubic meters each year it is located in all three se@@ wage plants .
for example , based on the minor distribution system , expenditure of several thousand Euros would be serious .
in addition , the waste water flow slightly dec@@ lining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the past period of se@@ cul@@ ation period , these three systems were not most recently fallen due to their age and repair costs in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
in the se@@ wage plant , Schmidt demonstrated that in the se@@ wage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage .
in the p@@ umping station World Heritage , the almost 20 years old conveyor plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond cl@@ amps L@@ opp had to be installed after almost 20 years , the cl@@ utch sle@@ dge dischar@@ ges and provide an additional ventilation possibility to be able to hold the water regulations in future .
Schmidt : &quot; this exceptional expenses came to these extraordinary expenses and maintenance costs which are correspon@@ d@@ ingly into account in the new cal@@ cult period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that at low temperatures in the three presses , expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; fully beat . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large maintenance costs for the se@@ wage plant has been sp@@ ared over the past 20 years .
the situation of the mentioned facilities will continue to remain in view of stone houses on duration , especially since you cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal region around these plants because it is a de@@ men@@ itarian facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect will criti@@ ci@@ zed as Asian cartoon
snap@@ shots says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool it allows snap@@ shots around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities on such a way that borders the absur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ flour@@ ished , independent of the tools that generate more than 30 million from selenium per day .
all the patches will get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved to criticism that they were accused of having to be accused of the app Black@@ face @-@ dere or white skin as a beauti@@ full deal .
when this week passed a filter to have a filter , the wrong teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , there are some critics called a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ atic - &quot; Yellow Prin@@ ces . &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y is pointing to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vin@@ ity .
the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after snap@@ shots revealed that it has been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asian .
but foreign , which have experienced ra@@ is@@ is@@ sm@@ us , rec@@ alled the filter to hurt cl@@ ut@@ ees .
other contra@@ ctors decided to make the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail he wrote Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose documents have been widespread far , that the filter ra@@ ven@@ ing and m@@ ild@@ ly was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it was added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the return of a very serious Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not bo@@ b@@ able , but that it has been dra@@ gged to the extreme extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnels .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless density and integration process , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in their hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are different things different things than their older players , could expect more likely to expect the sensitivity of mustard .
if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters an image produces that for a user experience , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to delete his Snap@@ chat account to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same .

&quot; I do not have various representation of people with other skin colour in their staff , so that they can meet these decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colour which work there , but not in positions , in which they feel safe or feel about what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the Company no figures publishes a number of staff members and points to his status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a number of personnel responsible for the population groups and on internal integration .
Z@@ hu said to her , she &apos;s her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I ask myself , whether they need more user like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership , IS@@ IS secret service information , presents Committee of Congress
as a consequence of the United States Central Command Central Command in order to draw an optimi@@ stic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed real states on site , reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can deleg@@ ated members , intelligence service providers and the military bud@@ get@@ ary report reported by a great dis@@ satisfaction of Central Command Secret Services , reported as preliminary estimates for the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Management Information , typically contam@@ inated by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed real states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide errors in Cent@@ Com goes up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct references to recognise that government tips are given under Obama , it shows how analysts saw the pressure on their prec@@ urs@@ or , an optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ sil .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command releases , opinions of comments and statements about the Congress were clearly positive when the facts correspond to the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after the months of investigations , as much as it was clear , &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from Kansas , in a opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command the Central Command will change the order services to record the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after them was played that analysts were concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway in addition to the General inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the news service committee published on Thursday their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com signed a revised process for the creation of retro@@ active service estimates by I@@ sil and the Iraqi security services , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. , in a memor@@ andum .
this process , as Mr. Ship , &quot; delayed the publication of retro@@ active services , &quot; the mor@@ als under analysis and &quot; gave exc@@ essive little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats were there , no not@@ ices at an intervention of the White House near Cent@@ Com analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found in regards to a &quot; particular political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the General inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , recorded by Cent@@ Com analysts &apos; complaints .
Ltd . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press conference of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress during the investigation of the General inspec@@ tors .
but he also proved that &quot; experts sometimes have quite fer@@ mented opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense was a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have taken out the effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the past year did not cast down the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honour@@ able charges of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criti@@ que concerning the sal@@ aries relating to the Islamic state recall some more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a book on the recommendations of many analysts , just a little occupying troops in Iraq and looked at a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting about the Islamic State .
last year , the team presented Mr. Hoo@@ kers after speci@@ fying government agencies that the statements of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because this provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but these knowledge was not released , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s , traditions of the time , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ atures based on his exc@@ essive positive assessment of the Senate on a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired into retirement in April and was replaced in Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States gain fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it cannot remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she told her .
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , this knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are simultaneously in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that remain un@@ defeated in Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
great Britain and the United States will hit the first round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams in their group will be able to obtain the first and second place within its group .
the first placed will go a little longer from the road that introduce the other group .
as always the game may proceed in Saturday , the Americans through their success story triggered a surprisingly host , four years after they landed at last London Games in the last of 12 squares .
B@@ am was part of that team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ack@@ et in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which she went wrong for her and her team .
following the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a ment@@ or change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the job of work in London , which we now have .
we have completely re@@ directed the ru@@ gs completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a return from the close range .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and maintained the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball about the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and lu@@ sted the ball into the gate to sell a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez took the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ ls of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to settle a goal in each of the previous games so far .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good is from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and incredibly soft , a spe@@ edy relay between competition and stri@@ ves .
it is when the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is enough to protect the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the s@@ wimm@@ ers for a tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch on TV , reading a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ y@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female black with dimples , could probably be able to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ feel TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even Fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are the sports , which are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ guns shoot , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it reign long .
but if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular lovers , then let me feel the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tr@@ ol@@ ines run already since 2000 an Olympic event , when it had made his debut in Sydney , it was perceived that many who had asked about it , did not know that it is at all an Olympic Port .
this could also be regional Ign@@ or@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the tr@@ amp @-@ jump and had a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong Assembly of China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ ri@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tr@@ amp @-@ jump has a certain outer size char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ discovered ear , for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a vintage enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trembling of his never to end up - but also the gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports , which are essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means that much means &quot; stepping board . &quot;
floating winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ ats and sal@@ es@@ tos ) before they landing on the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ad gram according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for Gold continues to go faster , more quickly , to top and go over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes way back and down , down@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground .
you will not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another destination : the world or the Olympic team .
the targeted bre@@ wing is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir up a viewer for tears .
but it is also what I think to look at that games as something exhau@@ sting .
the trampoline offers a breathing cause .
the v@@ ector of the tr@@ amp is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she hat@@ ch , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est , as an astron@@ aut , goes down to the bottom , then easily down to the top .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no v@@ ault into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant way of time and heavy force .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and land@@ lord of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult .
when the consciousness increase only through the Ang@@ an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the object of male athletes can be achieved - like the male U.S. Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his post to air , new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one ally Protestant US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , attracted some violent opposition from the government .
witnesses say that eighty Protest@@ ants were killed during the battles of the police with the police .
is Ethiopia straight to break in it ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable in Africa , a solid of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past few months protests against the government sha@@ ves the country and far more territories .
last week , thousands of people died on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses on that polic@@ emen were shot un@@ armed and killed .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , are showing how safety services will strike young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights require a detailed analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to match this country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous land of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and intelligence services collabor@@ ate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terror on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , received so much western help .
C@@ ush &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has been dra@@ stically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations continuously have continued the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents were transferred to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or put them in the desert times of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ y@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
one generation is Protestant .
there are plenty of complaints that cover everything from the ground to the dig@@ ging in relation to power of the governing coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions rise along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these gl@@ are , controversial line took in June hundreds of lives .
the analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were en@@ forced in the last years more or less , the tur@@ mo@@ il can be removed and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ration after years of shooting under the surface is explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones have been increasingly more likely and improved their internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , so many people can communicate over the Internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , which conce@@ al where they keep up .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave up that they were gathered together to protest .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Equ@@ al prosp@@ ered , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from A@@ th@@ op@@ ia mainly Christian countries , in the politics and economy , while they carried out the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes itself .
&quot; we are there to coordinate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the shops and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
until his death in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the disease of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of the corners .
the analysts say that he was especially toler@@ ated in this , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special experts to edit opponents and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing from this fundament@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
in other words , as Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of north country , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysis of analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome is more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time , Ethiopia had experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to information from analy@@ tics , apparently and stolen by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids , many protest@@ ants were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that period of dist@@ urban@@ ces passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ians Ethiop@@ ians leaders for its vision@@ ary infrastructure , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ enes , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able adv@@ ances at the poverty level .
but it obviously has not the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month the protests in gon@@ dar , an am@@ severe city , of Tig@@ ray managed shops and hatred opposite the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysis of analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies in a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used to use Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ oid on the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently admitted that it has closed this basis .
during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to support his ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama called IS@@ IS , &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign returns that his several times repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder , of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication rejected new questions about communication capabilities of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow country@@ men who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in which the property could explain to them that he could not have been meant .
after he had made the hin@@ ge on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the statement on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in a early mor@@ atorium on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply Sardin@@ ian .
the decision was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought the exc@@ use perfectly serious .
as the conservative ra@@ dic@@ ated Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , wanted nothing to do anything about the Republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism is based on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling down values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan , during this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return again to this topic .
however , on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he had bor@@ ing their speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ kas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he withdrew large criti@@ que when he thought , the Russians should tell Mrs. Clin@@ ics E@@ mails , but he later declared &quot; Nat@@ alia . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits to the policy and then forward to your needs .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they come , and then , &quot; clari@@ fies &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both Candi@@ dates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe that he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even blo@@ o@@ bi@@ ous sound , since its modifications have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to make exc@@ use for his pro@@ vocation , he charged his critics often , to understand his testimonies , or to understand his hum@@ our humor .
but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps have brought his lo@@ y@@ als Mit@@ z@@ zer into the un@@ comfortable situation , to be able to stand ir@@ respective of what pro@@ voc@@ ant may like his statements .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , a former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ ventions , there was great efforts to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said it to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is in this sense true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ feathers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ re@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government was under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton used as Foreign Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS to spread , to spread the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw off his attacks on any of his words and pre @-@ set against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ elled on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once on the price of the market , Café &amp; Green@@ point comes back
ver@@ b Cafe was an embroi@@ dered café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash but was no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was displaced .
the shop Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b , in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people worked as last loss in a gen@@ etically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ola wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but if New York Times is change , it &apos;s also new .
a re @-@ inspired Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly bad atmosphere .
the coffee is still good too .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employees of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he began working for Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer is offered to provide money for a new external building , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for Bag@@ gage bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ ing model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he led the new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are cooking rings such as cap@@ ers and s@@ auté onions .
there are natural fish keys .
the café is served no beer more , there are fresh sa@@ ws .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ owed electricity to old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after they moved to Green@@ point , they would take the way up .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while for a while , she told her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee , a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came from the quarter to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients to the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t know a G@@ roll about that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the cafés as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think we will come down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he decided to issue them soon , so that his new neighbor feel welcome .
the site has also further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance to expand the café on a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , saying that he was destroyed in the ground , when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ose Wh@@ itt was said that the bed of the restaurant and the best coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .

President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland flu@@ ffy soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pure@@ e and as dessert a pl@@ um men@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was published by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during Zi@@ egel@@ man published in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest collaboration , &quot; An Individu@@ al meal , &quot; which will appear at the Har@@ per publishing house on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
she showed culinary solidarity , as she met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ strian I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the IPO of 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive trees while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pure@@ e and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter was ordered min@@ ced , this was suitable for a discussion about eating over the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man said .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient and a little bit prepared , which reduces the ingre@@ dient .
imagine a lot of pe@@ an@@ uts to eat , that they serve them as a dinner .
co@@ e grin@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have laid lead in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ AT @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ ats for male rock du@@ es and it was freshly baked past@@ ed to breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent food to hunger during the First World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al , &quot; distingu@@ ishes the roads with which the country was converted to be no longer the S@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , split theme was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ ath@@ ed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as well , the new bud@@ get@@ ing equipment was excited : mysterious meals such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asserole , the c@@ asserole , as a &quot; wonderful kind , sh@@ re@@ lics out , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , since co@@ oks could hide the appet@@ ite sauce with a light sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry materials .
meat , for years , was the focal point of the American kitchen , was rarely grown in a rare luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally mixtures were tried , since a cal@@ ory and nutr@@ itious satisfaction was in front of taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research on the book , which also includes recipes , we prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions does not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since then , household management - including Louise Stanley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country alike .
by giving recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become home and transform the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical le@@ ak@@ ies .
in particular , the reports on the answer of the government are star@@ ving to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ Dinner @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen equipped with its kitchen , he sp@@ itted as the one @-@ million@@ th man from the world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a Smo@@ king .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful more realistic .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to st@@ ain his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the fact that the White House did not bring with any interest of flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt that the White House brought the most bo@@ red food in Washington , but also one of the most expensive food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected , once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our ongoing focus on calories and food , we said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple gave better understood the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in writing , for example , as they did not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; you actually did people really sick . &quot;
there was the case of wind .
after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ ù , the President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick that could not miss a good name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no heated cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something against a spoon into the fence , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly it did not feel bad .
Co@@ e got three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ er he spoke to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed by bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save their lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a single @-@ bom@@ ber attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Hel@@ mets &apos; , a civilian protection group that according to the image of the image , so far nearly 60,000 people saved lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers are setting up their own life to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil , which shows him from a house for a 11 @-@ hour rescue from a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to g@@ lowing tool@@ box in the se@@ a@@ wing of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die there , life to save lives , I think that God looks in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter has cast four cla@@ ys above the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children can play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had terror@@ ized terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ le is almost 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s usually occur only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the S@@ anna research team .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - till today .
Greenland only with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland tower is situated along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes on average 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seals .
this one of lon@@ el@@ iness st@@ ained lifestyle seems to be a patch for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen was born from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any event that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sc@@ out of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life @-@ range which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
indeed , the evol@@ ution@@ ist biolog@@ ist assumed that Greenland will be very old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s hair is difficult to observe , finally they live especially in the ice @-@ sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius , they occur in the surface usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle we know some little .
their time @-@ bends left them , when they took six animals in front of val@@ bard for six animals .
however , the prey make these shar@@ ks , but in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed up the p@@ bone of a young ic@@ ebre@@ akers .
probably , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look Ka@@ da@@ ver , which forks out of higher water layers beneath the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as cover from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimetres long , while the biggest 502 cm measure .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lin@@ k@@ core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye drops already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins later anymore .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
therefore , their birth should be in the atmosphere according to the early 1960s , when atomic tests attempts to s@@ wap this radio@@ active carbon s into the atmosphere .
in which with 220 centimeters in length , the liner core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all the larger Greenland animals had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was to be a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland , an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters could be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length of the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters will probably be at the threshold for the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland with the increase of at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live above all in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , on the neck a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured in Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there is often the organism that living animals living there on spar@@ rows .
so they mature later - and slower slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller beast lives together and should focus on it as possible as many children as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal was to invest in contrast to its resources more in a long life .
building floor in double pack
with topics around the building , the Municipal Council has been involved in the recent session .
with relief , the board of mayor Robert P@@ utz increased that &quot; finally , &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently published residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the boundary , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing issues are clari@@ fied and the applications could be adjusted in building areas &quot; street @-@ away &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) , nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bal@@ m in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and ch@@ ore senior citizens must speak equally .
as its name was , building content can be immediately disclosed in the town hall , on the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise that in its September meeting .
in order to res@@ ett@@ ish other commercial companies , linked to the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided not to change the newly created plan plan in parts of this year only in the spring of this year .
so in the area of under@@ tim@@ lar@@ es the industrial area has already been extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main has therefore , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chance to move from London and to attract companies from London .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am winning most of the Bre@@ x@@ ite vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ant , Head of the Compet@@ ence Area Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ ite referendum , it is un@@ certain that money houses may continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval has been sufficient for them in the UK .
this is just major US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to store jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance views E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its head office , but this is less significant for the financial sector less than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks , as they can communicate with the supervision of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a big fund sector , but also as Dublin as Dublin , in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am much easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the large airport .
further highlights the city with easily available industrial property management .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ man .
in addition to his own , the rentals of the first @-@ class industrial property management are 50 percent higher than the main building .
in addition , Frankfurt am a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to a good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consulting firm Mer@@ cer stands up the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxemburg on No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W is denied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of the Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote of the most important financial center in Europe , I will continue my economic researchers .
therefore , the forces of the dealers : in London worked in the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent with Mer@@ ck
a US official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal cost , which you created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gal@@ a@@ ad was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents by Mer@@ ck , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines of S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ical acts .
in the case of the complaint on Thursday , US Local in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman told that Gilead is entitled to save the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to pull out Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medic@@ ations , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck measures each other acc@@ ust@@ omed and property to laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r zu@@ b@@ ale , the active ingre@@ dient in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ ics deser@@ ve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement on Friday for 2015 , this revealed a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ tons donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their own office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice President , Senator Timothy Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statement from the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to pursue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ fer@@ nes delivered to Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false interpre@@ tations and re@@ tra@@ c@@ ements in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common to publish their tax statement , although it is not obliged to comply with law because of this law .
tr@@ ump , a New York businessman , and its lawyers are quoted as a reason for his ref@@ using to control a tax test by the control authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics elec@@ tr@@ uss in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regards to the publication of the Presi@@ dential decision of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ er to CN@@ N , that he would not allow tr@@ ump to release something before the tax tests are not finished .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal issues related to assets , his business relationship , and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already dealt pro@@ ud@@ ly on the topic and released on Friday a video on the Internet in the high ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans tr@@ ump to publish his tax returns .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech to the Michigan economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do that every other Presi@@ dential candidate has done for the last decades and to publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the multitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politi@@ co reported that tr@@ ump was not paid for two years in the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax@@ pay@@ ers and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
the Federal Office has become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and invest@@ or War@@ ren buff@@ et which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the suggest@@ ion .
during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ alo , whose Berk@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate found his seat to exchange their tax returns .
it was said that he was subjected to a control examination of the I@@ RS , and he did &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons campaign has withdrawn its tax return by 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics that now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax statement of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 compared to their income as a wage , unlike most of the Americans .
its main award ceremony was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9,000 stopped .

the Jewish director broke into Berlin in Berlin because Israeli preliminary selection was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; En@@ trance - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , since it had called Arab guests according to a staff of employees . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Dutch documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed in the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new German , fe@@ a@@ sible that Israel has eliminated and wiped out ?
he wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to vote Israel about their own call center .
after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel rec@@ ep@@ tive .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; caught him , &quot; says Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel suggested that the intervention was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director nor more rage .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann has been cited .
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
that is really very kind .
the fact that in Germany , in exactly this hotel chain , even greater shame is even greater shame .
no explanation requires that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident has released a quite large reson@@ ance on the Internet where people called for a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given the alleged &quot; Arab Gu@@ ests &quot; in the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she named him in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the no@@ k Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alle@@ g@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record in the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung described a spokes@@ man at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police reli@@ es Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ els against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students put together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they were assembled in order to demonstrate against the re@@ forms of the government for the public image system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ rant to demonstr@@ ators the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , when police officers tried to drive the students , which led the police with mig@@ rating stories and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their commitment to the plans .
according to the proposals of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were looking forward to the preliminary president Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the youngest prot@@ est events occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been written down by a vote of the Senate .
business between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of sanctions , according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 per cent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran fell in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 , rising to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade shift was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan runs out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign represent@@ ations made around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached top 20 of the countries , representing the number of places in Russia .
you may say that the record number of Irish tourists must be broken in Russia from the past year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

s@@ otto Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner is stor@@ med at home , when Br@@ ite Gold for cycling bikes
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the Män@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ man that had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who was looking forward as he was stor@@ med to home a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic ag@@ ons medals .
she repeated the trick after she took place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute of Jamie Staff .
they did this time when they appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired made a gap containing the K@@ ian enam@@ els and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw the potential of the s@@ corn which is now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y Winner - and S@@ kin@@ ner put an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the final round , the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
he was scar@@ cely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and back to S@@ kin@@ ner .
a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , in case of adding in a higher corridor to slow it down and to make it wrong and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they went to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sm@@ iling comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I only am here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he was leading to the railway after a weak start .
he withdrew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of English ri@@ vals .
with such an exc@@ essive victory there was no problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; it feels complete with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ es as London &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have so bad with so many world titles so that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that had seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress has been in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle current .
with the shape of this , it is in the area of possible that he repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be known for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an extraordinary date for the British Sport ; in the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the coming of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y will participate as the next in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels some lon@@ ely to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated in the Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ dge , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest power in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , who won gold in 2012 at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , while the W@@ ig@@ dge Station will focus on safety .
he was cont@@ ested in yesterday with Be@@ aches before the qualification round , when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Competition in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is located on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was lowered .
they took part in the background , so the resignation of the Technical Director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of S@@ ex@@ ism and Mob@@ ility lines and the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite after this then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melting of Portland due to the abol@@ ition of energy use
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of work@@ men - stand at the game , as the plant operator will cancel the energy contract , thus making all the delivery contracts as well as the supplier of the energy company .
this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to be commissioned to the plant .
a maximinum payout of 20 years will be released in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland will be standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be at risk of closure .
in addition , the melt @-@ effects come , as the melt of around 10 per cent of total electricity generation is consumed .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A completed the point of Henry melting , which led its last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A is losing money and risk a closing time .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollars and last for the power price of the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium line with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller proportions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting point , &quot; shared the company .
AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts called &quot; securing transactions &quot; are expected to enter into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from hence AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential consequences for the revenues of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are limited by the progn@@ oses of the strong terminal markets for major trade prices .
AG@@ L showed that it had already written the value of contracts already in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts , the ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of the melting or the supply to the melting of the melting point is not ad@@ ver@@ sely affected .
the US company said that in 2010 it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement guilty by the contract .
due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen told that Portland will consume around 600 meg@@ awatts each year and about 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , it would mean significant reduction in demand in the &#91; current market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as alter@@ nat@@ ors , it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Her@@ c@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the view of this co@@ vers brought me to the crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ i @-@ Her@@ e@@ berg family ) , how they forget the cover of their sister , Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn as well as in the presence of their most popular show@@ rooms Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn ( with the exception of their sister , Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn ) , as she ends with a classic wi@@ pe : they all have a surprise event .
this puts the kl@@ ash @-@ held hand@@ held for almost every birthday of a child returning ( Se@@ ac@@ rest ) that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the honour of a character string on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
in April 2014 , K@@ end@@ all of Kim likes her to have struck the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband C@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circumference , re@@ sembles a volume of image as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of wor@@ shi@@ ped ( L@@ ime Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the novel 615 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive that during the past two years , pictures of the magazine still att@@ ested to the official announcement of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Moss .
in recent years , there were more &quot; celebr@@ ities that mo@@ th@@ reading &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga who had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m model &quot; of her generation - below the earlier category , she is in good society .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young people from today that know how to convert a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is hop@@ ed to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like any success to everyone .
with her reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was a somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the spiritual Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues criti@@ ci@@ zed her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiled again , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the failure of the planet it seems to be passing at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super model in the tru@@ est sense .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ er from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ ments Apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in her leisure time she is seeing her in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
common areas have 160@@ ,000 people per year .
more than 160@@ ,000 of the registered people of the country are rejected annually by the common centres , while the industry has made its impact on the impact of further acquisitions .
in Queens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ righteous del@@ og@@ ations and those who have no funds for un@@ righteous del@@ og@@ ations and similar circumstances .
legal services of the municipality , which are already ag@@ fully util@@ ised , make for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will be able to lose an additional 30 percent of its federal funds .
the director of the Royal Society of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Public centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation , without a re@@ vocation of the decision of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land centres are chron@@ ically financed , what means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who have dismissed by divi@@ des , workers who have problems with divi@@ ders - all these people have problems right and this survey that they don &apos;t need the help you need .
by June 2017 , the Federal Government will be shortened by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General attor@@ ney and Federal Minister of Justice as well as sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis which will immediately rise to this centre , so that people may need help with legal problems .
last year , the state government met its commit@@ ments to raise funds for re@@ pris@@ ons on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the common areas and their customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k into this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are significant losses for the governing party SPD and the CD@@ U .
this gave representative surveys of opinion research institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition led to the north almost further , it is not possible after the query values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in both the German federal states , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have good chances to put the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collapsed by 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party can only be just under the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
today the successor domin@@ ate the world - its producer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty tight .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough for about two bl@@ ero@@ ds with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still purchase the equipment on the internet , but they originate somehow from the age @-@ time of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a couple of months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ al format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to be able to receive and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails , even by fax , to reach the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible with HTML @-@ browser , if also qu@@ ay slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and black @-@ white @-@ screen took place .
very proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average price of a smartphones in Germany in 2015 was 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was found in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
ever since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
finally , the mobile phone savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster that was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ate the suppliers that came all much later than Nokia .
always everywhere online , this is today for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold , approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ations company will come .
an entire industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough into mass market was early in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the launch of the iPh@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : one music player , a phone and internet communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
the winning stre@@ ak of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the following .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ understanding of 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn all learning the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for HR . &quot; &quot; &quot;

England must ste@@ ered the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local municipalities and throughout London , but bring in all the country &apos;s renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we managed to ensure a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will again be able to create new opportunities for the local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs will create new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as it was ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England will never be willing for the games and that we &apos;ll be bl@@ am@@ using ourselves on the world stage .
the two were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the expansion is an option to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to swe@@ aring and create a legacy of skills and employment in both around the airport and throughout the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was converted by a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented tread@@ mills of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third running ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we will expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as with our future trade and create a legacy of manufacturing and employment , which can be proud of England .

add @-@ block plus , Facebook at the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ Game &quot; concerning ad locking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that make money with online money , according to one of the software vend@@ ors tests attempts to handle display block , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat@@ ching and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus would like to block the blo@@ cking on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to block no advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his desktop page would change the coding in reference to his advertis@@ ements , to realize it &apos;s not@@ ices the detection of which part of side advertising is difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the anti @-@ directional open source community and the change@@ over have already been in progress since the invention of ad block@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes quickly with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company is left for social media in the fight , is a strong indication , as discussed as a wor@@ r@@ ying diagram for the industry .
according to a study , according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ der@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people have been optimi@@ zing ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , active users on Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ed 84 percent of Wer@@ d@@ oo@@ ks makes fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks .
the company has offered it on display blocks on Desktop PCs , as mobile display blocks have no effect on fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks that mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared one speaker with .
advertisement on your desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenues generated , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment in such a stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that there would be &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to update the people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that Ad@@ blo@@ c would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would like to block content on the site that are no advertising .
&quot; for users , there is no positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared one spokes@@ person for Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
sco@@ re@@ blocks have a silent means , which is why we have focused on the developers like ad pre@@ ferences instead , to put more control into the hands of the people .
Mrs. at suspected suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a prob@@ able suicide of several vehicles was transferred to a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman fell in the dark &quot; in one act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police spoke in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years , who was over by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
they still died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some of them are still not identified , the police told these as well as every witness of the incident to report themselves .
it was opened an investigation technique , which is a &quot; logical step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ ony to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that has to decide on the prosecutor , &quot; said the court .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran on the highway at the highway - it was decided that drivers do not need to go out that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police raid was acquitted when they were handed over and killed a man who was killed by a man on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious in the street .
the Court noted that the police had answered on an emergency call -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road a &quot; fully extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; was , the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday close to Morges , should noti@@ fies the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate od@@ ell : Venus was once liv@@ able
the Venus was probably once liv@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model in order to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms to those of climate research .
the model has been designed to determine if the Venus might even be er@@ ased with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dens@@ ities .
scientists previously showed that the slow movement of Venus might be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and yet to follow slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet , probably more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected even faster .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation , the slow movement of Venus will exp@@ ands its daily page of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this is heated the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which appears like a umbrella on the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus that re@@ sembles the evolution that was previously assumed by Plan@@ et research .
although they were presumably liv@@ able , the Venus -- was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
when you withdrew Hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophy@@ si@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back as trainer of Aval@@ on
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations to Colorado Aval@@ on as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey &apos;s involvement in the decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately look after a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years I have met my duties as Princip@@ al trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations to Colorado Aval@@ on with energy , passion and integrity , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in a memor@@ andum .
I have thought in the course of summer long and much more thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not satisfied .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanks to him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; Sak@@ ic said .
we all appreciate all that he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was honoured as the winner of the League of the League in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed during each of the two last years .
description of Aval@@ on in the 2015 @-@ 16 season has a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the wild for a second game card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy had won four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with the Montreal She@@ ets and Aval@@ on .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ zeb@@ ub take some convers@@ ations again , put on strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the working strug@@ gles on the re@@ wage for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ arbeiter are exposed , while all the dispute for a new focus will be set at the table , said his negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field providers of wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally arranged on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to new to re @-@ start the demol@@ ition process of the current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the next weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said that its last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice to the company is followed by a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore @-@ contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company has the required space to get through the market turn .
Shell has dismissed for his part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on his portion of oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ability with the British energy company BG Group .
as a result of the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that caused by the decision of the British in June to the European Union .
the Scottish Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the largest employment opportunities which took place in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and the whole country we require a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea as compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler World Heritage teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars in the star enh@@ ancing at different rates , as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods of the planet .
&quot; we hope that we learn through the comparison of our results with other clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a ster@@ ns , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ in@@ arian Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are now turning on the fastest .
these irrit@@ ating stars revol@@ ve large amounts of stars .
because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star reaches age , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by moving the time between the appearance of a visible star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spot -- .
the newest catalogue of rotary rates shows that more massive stars slower than less massive stars .
re@@ eds compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters are smaller than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare decorative qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades Provi@@ des an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much more than we want to know more about how , as , when , and why stars revol@@ t their rotation rates and so to speak your &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
an disputed bas@@ eball star starting from
tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional back@@ drop , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professionals will carry on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys for the last time the trick of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos;s &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game @-@ Game of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature on a ten @-@ year contract secured a 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he served as an advisor and a youth coach - with full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys have just two bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be accepted in the glory hall of the bas@@ eline .
for so Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field was so controversial is the appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was forbidden between 2001 and 2003 to have forbidden ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the primary , years long over an anti @-@ A@@ ging @-@ clinic in south @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have a delight for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without any break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends have once more get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she called Rodri@@ guez , who was married with act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the act@@ ress of Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympath@@ y acquain@@ tance of fans from the Y@@ an@@ kee @-@ patri@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ob@@ inski are first di@@ op@@ ing@@ es
know : because of a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ ing , Adrian Ob@@ jects from Poland can not start to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games in 2016 are buried by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ falls .
another athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
prior to the seventh competition , the first official deriv@@ atives have become known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - just before the beginning of the athlet@@ ic Athlet@@ ics competitions these messages come to the accident .
on the last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tics has been proven by hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ d , which is used as a m@@ asked remedy for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ zen .
Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.09 seconds missed it with the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have supposed to take part in the foo@@ th@@ ills over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ ah from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for san@@ ction of sport@@ s@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is innocent , &quot; the only statement might be a dietary supplement , &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics in athlet@@ ics .
according to the report , it is alleged to act in the banned substance by blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended in provisional , according to B@@ NT should also be a positive effect on the B @-@ Trial .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately reported criticism of the athl@@ ete with criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right shoulder , &quot; said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , approximately all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London @-@ Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as a brother of Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both k@@ ills the intake ; however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes it is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa , a further severe blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings . the L@@ äu@@ ke Kenya has also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the year of racing , the former associations followed in China for fierce disputes also caused by the athletes .
thus the French@@ man C@@ amil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the Podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a meditation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping f@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 for the Chinese championships have been positive to the stim@@ ulation of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ r , but had to sit on only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ es : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses H@@ acker her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of compres@@ sors malware provide a targeted company - and have been successful in this process .
according to a current survey of the malware war@@ p specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed at least once , some several victims of an attack with im@@ print software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies had already achieved target of a ran@@ som@@ ware detection .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to be requested by the Daily for sol@@ dering services to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized in the management software according to the observations made by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful , the potential to achieve low @-@ end sol@@ dering money is significantly higher than for private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the harmful software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski , in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rator revealed software for itself .
only private users were the aim , but the change to company att@@ age was terri@@ fied quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , you are looking forward to in@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files are encrypted with the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the press .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the cr@@ atic tow@@ ing bit .
but where with private use , the personal photo database is based on the game , it goes to firms for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the loss falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies affected lower sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to break down their business activities , in case of a case people were affected in life .
in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
it is difficult for managers to reject the perpet@@ rators to reject the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good rep@@ utation .
in a recent study , the safety researcher from F @-@ Secure examined the user @-@ up and contact with the press releases : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you will explain their victims by chat , as you can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and , private professionals have redeemed according to payments of a few hundred million euros , companies have to pay partly hard @-@ negoti@@ ation and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data in@@ key .
considering the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ik@@ less gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware detection , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , &quot; Security experts Chester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski , from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is likely that there are three or four people .
the programmer sell their cont@@ amin@@ ants in the form of a software box to the actual stress of the software .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of supply is a adap@@ ting tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stress look for another h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so in one of the forums in the underground , the set is bought by a crime and commissioned another way to install the software as many PCs as possible .
payment is made by means of a modified machine .
&quot; usually , the crime shall then carry out sp@@ elling and pro@@ ving , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies who get their data better .
over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey , based on a ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scans software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not provide sufficient threat to successful recovery more , the perpet@@ rators will rep@@ lied with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ cing cul@@ ations , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential potential of potential for the type of data even more much higher than before .
also , the perpet@@ rators also could take full new targets on the Internet of Things ( in future ) .
on the request of the dispute , def@@ con demonstrated a safety for@@ ger , such as the thermo@@ stat to the Internet connected to the Internet .
in the middle of winter the thr@@ ott@@ le of a der@@ ous heating could be well worth a ran@@ som for a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators started to block a whole production street in the future as a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
in the little HR V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty much over@@ load , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , there is no place close to either .
the materials of the inner space are well finished and have a pleasant , only the cockpit side falls into something .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR V in the storage box .

disease : when paid by the organizer
suffering from illness will only get money back after their trip , when the cause of the disease is des@@ per@@ ately available at the hotel .
that is , however , only the case if more than ten percent of guests are proven to show the same symptoms .
the case in the hearing was a family on the second day of their tur@@ ret heavily on di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ists back on a defective ca@@ ran@@ som , which allegedly contam@@ inated the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , that the journey wasn &apos;t a lack - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after refugees were violent violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had wor@@ ried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state has to be bes@@ ee@@ zed and decided to react on terrorist attacks .
sure : our country will not respond to the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
we won &apos;t give this triumph to the terror@@ ists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , but increase the safety and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another person gain of security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ digit order for more than several years . &quot;
the sympath@@ y for terrorism has to be under penalty again .
video surveillance is to be improved , which will be amended in compliance with the purchase of weapons on the Internet above all .
the last much discussed silence for doctors should remain in mind after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
however , if he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with medical juice , such as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view to psychological review .
in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ alisation of refugees , the minister holds a better social care for necessary .

for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ating investigations .
SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot;

&quot; this was a cra@@ ven for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the media group ( Friday ) .

better transport flow on the highway to the motorway
it st@@ ems regularly on the b@@ yp@@ ass road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal limit shall be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic on the ambient road every night in a stand , when they go through the highway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the street is extended next to Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) in the area between the hammer road and the Wes@@ eler Street exit at 700 meters .
drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early as early as the total of the total exp@@ iry of the national road 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the lane lane is nervous before all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back of the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also goes beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ries on the B 51 shortly before the main road Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic will only be guided on the highway bridge .
the second track had to be back over a three @-@ quarter year ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to record mainly the heavy duty @-@ traffic .
how long this eng@@ aging and that it can last long , the constant organisation can not say .
however , it is expected to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official rest@@ rained duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal extent of the legal age , the state of the traffic can be sought after school holidays , because of the disability .
traffic will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday at the construction site .

relaxing Night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll down forever , at night there is stun@@ n@@ ach for hours , in the morning it is not far to think of sleep .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep problems and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanent as non @-@ relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there can be many different reasons , emphas@@ ising Hans @-@ Günter Weber , a member of the board member of the German society for sleeping and sleeping Medicine .
what one under@@ stand@@ able among them is , but the in@@ som@@ nie , so is an in@@ firm@@ ament and a sleep@@ y .
just to sleep , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Haus@@ smann association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological , or @-@ related factors can also be put on medicines .
not rarely is the distur@@ bing expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is often very often at an depression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors form one another .
those who , for example , has a band@@ ment failure , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours , and begin to sal@@ v@@ able , about everyday problems and help make a swe@@ ep , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sleep problems for the doctor ?
who does not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is imp@@ acted on the day , the doctor should take reven@@ ge .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look different : one is crushed , tired , un@@ disturbed , has difficulty with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has vo@@ cal fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like stomach or heada@@ ches .
in order to adapt to sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , different behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavior , or drugs - classic stroke let@@ tering only occur in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks .
in Germany , there are hardly any un@@ maintained dormitories of Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ res , director of the inter@@ disciplinary medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should contact with sleeping difficulties at first , at first , take reven@@ ge .
of course , the problems can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should walk in the slaughter , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in slaughter or medical care , for example , in s@@ nor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of disease @-@ ti@@ ring , at bed@@ time or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep@@ ing@@ ness , explains Fi@@ etze .
in reality , you do not have to prepare .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dis@@ abling , one starts into the bed with his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a chest strap , a chest strap and a feel@@ ers on the finger .
it also features a camera to the ceiling of the sleeping corner .
how can the problems get involved in the grip ?
there are quite many screws , on which one can sit for a better sleep .
we@@ ather@@ proof counts on : regular sleep and rising times , not to sleep long on the bed , not watching television to sleep , alcohol and don &apos;t watch at the clock - then it starts to count immediately , and that &apos;s not a secure way .
what did the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold a dis@@ appo@@ inting introduction to the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doha , and presented its first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ ve has taken place on Facebook as Facebook as Facebook with the criti@@ que of the explosion @-@ team @-@ mates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic Champion of 20,000 € gets awarded and a Jung@@ le King 150,000 € should not be wonder@@ ing about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday at his Facebook page .
the conveying system in the swimming pool is po@@ or@@ ly , the d@@ oping controls were very good .
in doing so we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot more and do not even operate in the topic of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that these controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he started to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ ve would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
just as you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who can &apos;t take a certain time before the World Cup / OS from independent aud@@ its of WA@@ DA / F@@ INA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not allowed to participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the election of Hamburg , who has now run an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bonds of luggage .
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf airport
most of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the tat@@ too were committed to several ash@@ ore and baggage st@@ ems as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 A.@@ M. , civil servants in the field of Düsseldorf airport adopted a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since the middle of July and were very profession@@ ally trained and particularly profession@@ ally trained .
the specialists from the Criminal Code 34 of the det@@ achment of the crime of criminal off@@ ences can go to Germany to demonstrate four acts of criminal off@@ ences .
they had spent a total of € 15,000 .
Alt@@ build@@ ed , a few ram@@ parts , in between still a rest of head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east to the west , you arrive at Spiel@@ berg , a refreshing children &apos;s garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ate .
at the facade of a gray house , someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which should be demolished soon , will be built here : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as is called Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in , will be illustrated with com@@ promising cars in the last weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of the rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin &apos;s in@@ sen@@ ator handle had been specially designed for a hard demonstration of the police against the project against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the premises were cleared in the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ mi@@ thy , with 300 police officers , was pat@@ rou@@ ded parts of the streets with 30 to 40 officers and three team wagon on site , un@@ locked parts of the road and managed to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , its renovated building workers in the order of unknown houses the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers went down under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peace@@ fully : parents walk along with children , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others keep going to late .
primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are situated in the immediate vicinity of the zone .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who attracts three children here are mostly from the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects they share the care for rent and genetic purposes .
it sounds not according to an or@@ z , which means a majority of polic@@ y@@ fish in front of the left hand .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin in@@ sen@@ ator and police , between house@@ keeper and their neighbours , does not exist , obviously not .
Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional living area , which is also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high levels of poverty .
the occupied residential projects and the resulting residential projects had long been owned by the Kiev : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the whole mainst@@ ay street near the Riga .
while the main@@ board had been cleared under a large police force , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district of the last few years has become increasingly important for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from around the world : now residents of GDR times and former house@@ keeper have become their jaw .
this is also noticeable during the rental period , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : they det@@ ects them in sw@@ apped slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown into colours .
no other road was mentioned as often in this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that , not all the neighbors could see that as a problem , could not necessarily be affected by the crime of criminal off@@ ences such as body infr@@ in@@ gement , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make atomic facts , which ten@@ ds to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a home house next to the cont@@ ested 94 , un@@ certainty can be no talk .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which are not intended to have been .
even the famous com@@ bu@@ ing cars do not give it directly to the R@@ ī@@ ga no longer .
for having studied Archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
therefore it was so important that the inhabitants have recovered their streets : by the police , the politics and the media , in July , all of them suddenly conquered the Deut@@ ung@@ sho@@ ness of the district .
but in the eyes of some hab@@ itations such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by a sm@@ iling new@@ builds in former building g@@ aps that for@@ ge the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are at the end of the apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people living so well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction may be absolutely un@@ cont@@ est@@ and@@ y . &quot;
but what should one do if anyone does not listen to someone ?
he has reli@@ ed on all sides of fru@@ stration , also in the police and the inhabitants .
for those that are offended in colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
who draws up , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a bar @-@ quarter , can be po@@ or@@ ly chargeable to noise .
all people only asked with pre@@ names are asked , not to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ator .
she also is a social worker in the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been the refugee institution for Ur@@ bach since July .
social pe@@ dagog@@ y supports the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ z@@ berger .
she looks as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group for refugee aid , administration , authorities and those else .
Reg@@ ine Client of the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that the honour of honour is more than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ver@@ le is now there , the e@@ ager@@ ly wo@@ wer@@ ch@@ sau that has a problem .
in this way , some - less spar@@ ing compared to the multitude of w@@ ishing problems - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for a talent with a talent for languages and people , linked to many years of experience in the field of social work , just an en@@ chan@@ ted Woll@@ ch@@ sau .
however , administrative work is not their central area , means Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , there is an organization , working with the people on the spot , and behind the scenes and network materials .
the 31 year old has been in existence for around six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent job on three years term .
&quot; it was t@@ allest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Hon@@ our and the official actors .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a significant problem it is for some time to find homes for the connection con@@ vol@@ at@@ ings which have been recognized .
for the junction of the connection , the commun@@ es are competent .
they must accept the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the community itself .
the responsibility is replaced by the Council and of the commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been a very difficult time for some time .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
it did not work until now , however , be dependent on private apartments , as Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore , the apartments must be car@@ ded as it is so beautiful .
so soon , new containers will be installed in the was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are vocational training places , training places , training places , A @-@ euro jobs and savings for refugees and migrants who need to be spot@@ ted or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , rest@@ art@@ ed non@@ profit work - and motivated and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
she hopes that the work will lead to the community for a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he doesn &apos;t work just work .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a cour@@ ageous feeling .
so you need to do offers like sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so please ski@@ p here to manage and volunteer here .
it may be central that the refugees get the feeling , they would be welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to refugees that it will take time and they can make the time meaning@@ ful , for example with language courses .
if you feel the feeling of development , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t want to work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate .
the distinct majority is motivated .
there is also problems to be honest , &quot; people said , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this would be a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after the recent present fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the customer clearly states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ ve is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a remaining risk could not be able to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the terrorist attacks bring them complete .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers have to look for a volunteer in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new coll@@ ision could come to refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach .
do Germany need a upper limit ?
to respond to this question , the policy is dis@@ cour@@ aged .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been utilized , to integrate existing people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young males .
but if people are in need , one must help them , they are both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
