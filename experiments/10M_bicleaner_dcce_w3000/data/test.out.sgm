<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that want both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, unone are the two U.S. Presidenbers in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regulating regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to overthrow the economy and regulate the economy to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, he would be different, asserted trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will redistribute regulators massively, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax principles - for private professionals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has given discrimination, and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which he has to be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost like the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Public investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state-ritusian Texy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, on trump, then the internal discussions could be coming.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in the energy and climate policy are interpreted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump intends to build coal-fired power plants and return to the US in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil promotion is likely to be possible in the protected areas with the" "" "climate change agreement" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand its investment program with its investment program and demands: "a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - including international trade agreements, the two competitor are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpose-fish agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "at the same time both the US do not want to isolate from international trade, but simply protect American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Which should then be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump is going to do in this question is not really clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushing, then he doesn't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, that the budgetary deficit would only be higher.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is looking at least from the rich they want to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy Chairman of the assistants have called their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Relations"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and to announce the official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish defender in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in receiving me, I can not be denied the impression that Ankara wants to propitize the reconciliation of reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles worked narrowly, and he omitted it with heat, even for his recital conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly by his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day is a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so far as would never happen to be something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasts seemed rather to interpret the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that he had not forgotten Russia's state of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his admission: the shooting of a Russian campaign for the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow in response to the time was wutedly burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, because it was celebrated by a forged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is difficult to build up again, if not even impossible to be impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a ferocious, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time the Turks seemed to bear all the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious, the allegations of senior officials admitted that Earth's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He did this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place therefore, because Putin received the President of the President of the Republic of Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "Erdogan run on the first line of all the friends that he can get after he was almost wiped out last month with a coup d" état of almost his ministry. "" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is also commercial motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions imposed Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of employees decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel organizers and chargers will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on one late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State Television forecast its budget fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is livid to the west because it was the response to the tried power in response to power.</seg>
<seg id="38">To achieve this, the persistent groll over the accession negotiations for accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pipiety is to draw out the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded in Ankara with a claim that he demanded the attempted coup d "état support for the chosen state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is a matter of Moscow. this is a matter of self-intelligible, which gave himself a profound fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this magnificent palace along the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described a analyst, "Alliance of Foreign Policy:" two countries who reject the west and poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently given the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support additional parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be characteristic that after almost three hours of the first discussion on the press conference, they said that they could not have undergone the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the President of Turkey missed it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey oss the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of states are at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's overpriced Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin fired unexpectedly for his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a many years part of the closest confidentiality of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport operations.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin it is that Putin was arranged without giving reasons "the dismissal Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian predialect."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was the representative of Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, completing his degree at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later became protocol managers and Chief Leader of the governing death.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Chief of Staff to the Law and inspections for the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked that Ivanov asked his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidentists in Vladimir Putin and works as he is responsible for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on TV, both men said that his Chief of Staff enters on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite a smile for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was employed as potential President, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large skepsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you to talk about this very complex post in the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complained items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Like it out, I have been chairman of the Russian predialect for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin is a former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB was named Ivanov appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once more, Ivanov was supposed to be President of Russia after the second term of office, as a third term of Putin was going to reject the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, close allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go down from the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensland Crosse.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering sector in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is an heikle activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the entire Brückentcks are located at their place and the last section of the Decks, today in Rosyth gets a bedding for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to reach its place at the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="16">This has been reached south by pulling-up of 700 millimetres in the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very heated operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at a gradient of approximately 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heifer, because the tolerances of the team works, they were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should have taken much stronger into the duty in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How will you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "manual concept" in front of the next ratchet.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who should actually build the convenient apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Christoph Frmann says: "we are interested in the Greens with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, in future 20 percent of all homes have to show as social flats."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The great dispute in the town hall is, however, the violinist: "how are you going to sell to investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want that investors on such surfaces are at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the homes as social flats." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">More staff will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we are getting the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not stand completely, because the 1260 new apartments should be built-in.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 favorable apartments whose funding will be expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By the year 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planation of spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now.</seg>

<seg id="30">The number of public dwellings in the Weststadt will again be drastically further increased from the goal of the so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with it, on screens at the last decade of many bemoans.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people are going to fetch people from the sofa and be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was at the beginning of TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not able to exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am talking of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters, which first were created for the video games in the 1990s (later it became a animation series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popular culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days Pokémon Go had more users than an adult and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go to their smartphone with their smartphone, looking for Pokémons, who were followed by a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which defines the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users who followed by Washington Post recently agreed that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of people going to train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for increased performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public ascension campaigns to health, people want to bring about 30 minutes of time to come "from the sofa," and "launched every day," beat down ears because many public embassies are getting boring and of people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be judged.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are led regularly sports, reduces his chances of cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to introduce it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that people bring to do something in the outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close up new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are müretric gamble, which must always be harder to complain.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already could follow our activity earlier, they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose its appeal and the use is refilled with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that can be linked to apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On all the line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now at last the Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerin erklomm on Thursday to multi-campaign titles and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total score of 62,198 clearly was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" -Mannardskameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal in Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans of Simone Biles can be found on the Swedish beam during the single multi-year campaign during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexuals American woman, winning a multi-campaign titles and a total of the fifth, while holding their reputation, the best of their generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">It broke out in tears, when their final result was shown and their long journey was at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought up their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Billy dominated their sports field, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue from her said that she has ever seen "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of athletes, but rather between it and a load oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not being returned with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans of Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace them, having each of gold and silver in the single multi-level race course of women in the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Billy, the first Medal on Tuesday, while on the farewell party was ordained into retirement in his retirement in Martha Karolyi, Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Billy existed on it, during their long driving on the top, never the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical tumor passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip in the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has no more lost multi-combat competition, a winning streak that will be as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also when Mustafa was slightly led by two rotary hings, the picture hatched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pig-beams and vapours - in which Biles holds the world title - lusted.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, she caught up again with 15.433 again on the Swedish bar - and placed on the ground with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her - a pure formality - a pure formality - and tears in Billy shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision that they once described in their collective book, to reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The power of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when they fought for the third place, but the bronze medal was in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old man-chapel mentioned by the Americans "Oma" had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil exercise, they threw the audience to the audience of Kusshy, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared to doubt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I wanted to do with the Women's Olympic team in the Turns and that's more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been in the summer of 1984 for every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, Catholics, complete, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has noted the black and hispanic female presence at the tip of this sport-art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years number one was one of the female gymnast a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a great Olympic winner in and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the unbelievable performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as it was unexpected, but masterly-known Gymasheer routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexuals American woman who won gold for women with an individual multi-ring event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manna member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but so we don't see classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics is only four gymnasts of the team. furthermore, she is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a more expensive sports and Turner first combined in private turntables that are perished for their training, educational and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be adjusted arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are lying in a wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner will receive its entire training and that's a long lasting long term for families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have joined both their athletes, since they started with the turner.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspect the municipalities of Aun innumerable, young girls who will be inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an accessible and easy access training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnFoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have prepared free and affordable turner in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth up high-quality turkeys that earn the opportunity to learn from this amazing olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops starch, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and professional and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the turmoil and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team of team and thank you for so many young girls with a different background motivated to become a healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British tour intercepted his immune system and dignitaries of serious examination - by doing some of the most tasted and fastest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk wiped his train on a Euro note, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a purge on a draw toilet and a public telephone in Russia to present the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the object of each object, it used a Luminometer to show oneself for what he will let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was titled "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was filmed and brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea, insing the dishinsing head of a towing toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely eradicated, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately we didn't leave what he leaned, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intms by moving through the world, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public transport to railway stations up to dishwahns of toilets, the task was the immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the movie he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, worms and slammed water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie he was just entitled to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a Luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the output of the Luminometry length is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop, after its Luminometry was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the movie he says:" "" "this is the worst that I have taken in a toilet, close to" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here because it is indoor here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company supports Mr. Wright with Valio Sus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching, and at the same time explains the advantages of Probiotika.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed the crazy brainstorings through which we ended that we said "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the meaning of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way for consumers.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directed, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he'd have tasted some of the things that I have instructed him to leak, like the eky Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, and others, in which this was quite hard.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were questioned with the wellbeing of stomach and intestinal bacteria and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="4">By 2021, the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacation, the European Parliament approved the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As long as far, it doesn't matter: summer holidays, heat and land nouns - which is fair.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the voting rights are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are on the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems: in the vacations are helpers, flatten the posters, flyer flyers and to count them at the end of the vote, just tipping.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the electoral and final day of the month, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go over even for a campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say it has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear him.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 is the strongest party, is now in polls behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting as strong newcoming alD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous voter campaign, one sees his grandparents.</seg>

<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North-CDU renounces largely on the usual parliamentary elections on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, that's how Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The union also has noted that in the country you have bothered the base, that it must be very strict to find a wire for the people again.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game is, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just under the Mandate (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD already won 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="2">In speed with which the B 27 has been renovated, there is nothing to know.</seg>

<seg id="7">The construction site was to be transferred to the south until the end of October to be completed by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then the opposite is also responsible for the construction of the persons responsible for the establishment of accommodation stations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday to the south, and the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is relaxed, the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofandingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transport through the village seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation management of Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of Bachke, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many shots were looking for and rather than the signs to the Navi.</seg>
<seg id="14">What is led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas are in stock.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality urged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people do not have to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-rehabilitation with them lead to sales in sales, everyone is asking to look through.</seg>

<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krona, finds significant words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is threatening to exist.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all of the restaurants were "tough."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customer was missing from Hechingen, Balingen und Rotseil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro.</seg>

<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, whether it might be a financial compensation for otherwise of the advantages of the location on the B. now, they also have to carry out the disadvantages caused by the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other rural districts, where such things were more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, and it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">In fact, others can understand that other regular guests should now understand due to the complicated traffic feed less often.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one can't drive there, it is also quite beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="24">Manches has even been on-breaker and can be open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the inetreatment of Gedser, for example - the question arises: what does that actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it's not possible to imagine that the attack on Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people do not profoundly, let not go out even in constituency times.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel applications, the delivery will rise worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it goes round.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the return reaction there are vortex about a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest bus service can continue to achieve a plus in spite of the diesel version thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, VW jumped the core brand VW mainly in Western Europe and thus unloaded the overall sales as that included in the Dax-listed company.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide VW sold the brand VW in July with 449100 cars, 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, sales of the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries were almost one sixth round deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chief of Chief of Staff Jurgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July, above all on two sales days in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some kind of core markets, the economic conditions "altered economic conditions" has been granted.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British government had stressed the withdrawal from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust outlets first escalated, there is also a decrease to a decrease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles are produced.</seg>
<seg id="17">From January to July, the Chief Executive Officer Fred Kappler was able to move further up a sales strategy from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen published 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust system.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the wake of the upgrade, VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After reupgrade of vehicles, it is possible to reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the bus service has a" guaranteed "" "guarantee of the customer after rearmament, but don't talk about a" guarantee "" "" as it was on Friday in company. "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason of legal refinement.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen bestows his German customers now a guarantee for diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Culture has been confirmed that this meeting was given.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has carried out the editions of my investigating commission and of the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"variations of these are not accepted," declared Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor output after rearmament does not take place, and all typing relevant vehicles will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee," but not as it was in corporate business.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "Guarantee" Volkswagen is the possibility that customers will come back half a year after the upgrade, with a motor damage to a workshop, and this could cause the new software to do so even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important to avoid the customer interests that in any case of any other damages that nothing can do with the trouble-scandal, as stated by means of any possible warranties, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who purchases hard sound panels?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you can make a comment on the comment, in order to oversow him under the pseudonym of non-Alleak-defects with rinsults, this statement is directed by current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reformation of sound plates does not like to rely on a boom in millennials that would like to greet the curiosity of physical objects, but attributable to mid-life nostalgic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely to increase.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables only keep their feelings rather to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy this time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would walk through the camera, while I carry in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stop, keep my hands and have some utmost importance as: "so, let us throw us an immediate look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers have been resident - there is a handful of fully developed stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I say by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men's middle age, a woman probably around the 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it says," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound panels, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I have not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them when he was sold and once sold to buy items as he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy slabs, rather introverted, and like to spend their time alone, and adds: "I do not smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my spaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers who hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback to purchase their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually have completed their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to purchase their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of a certain age in the annexing of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds into a shop such as Phonica in order to realize that sheet shops offers a soothing community of equered inner city.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers accepted an impulse to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed themselves from the digital world and would like to move the stability of the trusted plate cover, by objects and happily watching jugenderies.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector, so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal in mind.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "killed a staff of a turnout stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A poll of ICM revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record still haven't listened to the last month.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I would like a piles of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of result: three men's middle age) has noticed a "Trophy aspect" of the reverse aspect.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently arrived here and said," "" "I own no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio head record, that I can put them in shelf" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music fiber.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are getting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Pitstop, which has devoted to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I am going to clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists, photos make photos, teenagers and women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, wild Beasts of newest Synthesizers and experts rather than by experiment from speakers - it's good to see such a diversity to customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks strange, but the mental traumata are hard to be fixed when you stand next to a length of 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes, and considered the variability of the selling plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It does not make a manspouse as a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting of sheets not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a pleasant epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record players: Urban Outfters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to mug the jeans hotpants, I observed a group of young teenagers who grouped themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley plate player.</seg>
<seg id="56">The left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of this, every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and some customers could find in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most of luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my reresearch reports that the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in plate shops in Soho, who exist a large number of female collectibles and turntables that exist in reality, record shops and onlinework.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not on board stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while using the rigid gaze of an unfortunate, 30-year-old false Moderator meier about the shoulders of any man's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants within the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a trial on this week, the authorities argue that the state should be transferred to 72 temporary businesses within the camp goods, selling cigarettes to Energyms, sell-hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have to offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 Provisional business but the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "absolutely retracably."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would be able to play a much bigger role than only people live, who live "in extremely preference terms."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-he Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at a result of 43-7 in the deiodine stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class champion in the handling, Side-Stepping, landing, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiad in each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the non-bad trophy of silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they were able to be able to do their efforts in this tournament in which they struck new Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall at it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independent of it would have been killed in this form a 15-man-team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it probably will probably not - that at least a Brite will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path after itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost her game under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slider will wehdo, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfully and caused the attacks of GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at, as one would run in moving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau went up in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai played another attack from the right corner, which he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly have the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heavior Tons of Mitchell stop the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only has shed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Verford in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou recessed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as the Fiji was born to play 7, while GB still can be picked.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led the basic changes to half time by and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua came through to a brilliants interplay from Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the southern sulphur, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-bag cap with another try in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more common gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing boat to the last, 220 harsh hieve that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it were only the confessions who sat at the Ruins, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympics in a row without a tax-woman in succession, the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter undisputed use, which is also an exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who slides over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the type of Triumphes of geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each of gold in rowing, there is a battalion to infallists that make the difference, and there was no more hilarious than the coach that would not survive this day before 30 months, when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who can be operable and they did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a little bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could begin treatment early 2014, outside of the season, could begin what the interruption was held at a minimum, in case that under such circumstances it is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve in the morning to talk a little more than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the Captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated just how much that this means, how much that I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would have no one, hence a massive Danke on him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close together, Stanning and Glover had to reserve a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called 'stay in the process, stay in the process. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do today no fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bell has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fellowship, Spirit, health: sing for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her entire life: as young girls she was in school choir, studying music, she sings the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing Me - emotional and physically," explains it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, it feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, says it.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next door, they do something good in their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is like a great hobby, a great hobby for seniors, tell a Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and sharing the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular cohesion, seniors can link and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp made in their choir: "to arrange and organize yourself to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of contour."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, believes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For they train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever demands his lung regularly, is not so fast in everyday life in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For elderly people often, Singen is often a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Government of senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher pitch, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Luent often observed that singing or hearing of songs with older people raised many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and particularly melodies are sincerated by lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia people go back to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case, the head is also required for a particular performance, he explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, to focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live solely on, do not only practise themselves to concentrate on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition they departs by the singing in chorus, believes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves to show yourself: if I take a bit for something, I will get better and awake through me - this experience is strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate to, even if he wants to have little talent, lent Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing it - at 50 singing people who hears it when a sound goes on it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the matching offer, seniors have various possibilities, tell Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone can join the world's degree in an old enchantor, it can be simply connected.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="32">He who wants to sing in a church choir is able to move directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many seniors choirs as well.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask help with the internet connection.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the desire has to sing, it should necessarily be connected to a choir, oblit Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing praises to the soul, and has something freiendes - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="24">Ltd. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press conference of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress during the investigation of the General inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also proved that "experts sometimes have quite fermented opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense was a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have taken out the effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of the past year did not cast down the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honourable charges of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critique concerning the salaries relating to the Islamic state recall some more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a book on the recommendations of many analysts, just a little occupying troops in Iraq and looked at a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting about the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team presented Mr. Hookers after specifying government agencies that the statements of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because this provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But these knowledge was not released, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms, traditions of the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislatures based on his excessive positive assessment of the Senate on a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team in a match against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said it cannot remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she told her.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are simultaneously in their group with the Britons on the first place that remain undefeated in Japan after their 2-0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will hit the first round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two teams in their group will be able to obtain the first and second place within its group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will go a little longer from the road that introduce the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may proceed in Saturday, the Americans through their success story triggered a surprisingly host, four years after they landed at last London Games in the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was part of that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania on, and had the first time with three years a hockey acket in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the youngest player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as it was not able to qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which she went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We had not the job of work in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely redirected the rugs completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a return from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and maintained the match from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball about the left flank, then moved to the center and lusted the ball into the gate to sell a 2-0 guided tour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez took the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the Torls of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to settle a goal in each of the previous games so far.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and incredibly soft, a speedy relay between competition and strives.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is enough to protect the swimmers to the swimmers for a triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch on TV, reading a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queue in the queue, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leyy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female black with dimples, could probably be able to be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-feel TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are the sports, which are not universally recognized: airguns shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular lovers, then let me feel the attention to the discrete charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trolines run already since 2000 an Olympic event, when it had made his debut in Sydney, it was perceived that many who had asked about it, did not know that it is at all an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the tramp-jump and had a athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong Assembly of China and Rosie Macrian from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp-jump has a certain outer size charme, partly because it sounds for the undiscovered ear, for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a vintage enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end up - but also the grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports, which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means that much means "stepping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Floating winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling movements (turning, heats and salestos) before they landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official Olympiad gram according to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for Gold continues to go faster, more quickly, to top and go over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes way back and down, downwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You will not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another destination: the world or the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted brewing is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir up a viewer for tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think to look at that games as something exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing cause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the tramp is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she hatch, seemingly heaviest, as an astronaut, goes down to the bottom, then easily down to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice, there is no hectic attack on the destination, no vault into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant way of time and heavy force.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and landlord of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overseen in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the consciousness increase only through the Anganthropoids and the object of male athletes can be achieved - like the male U.S. Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Dooley expects his post to air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable in Africa, a solid of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>

<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, are showing how safety services will strike young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>

<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous land of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terror on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, received so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cush's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>

<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations continuously have continued the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents were transferred to silence.</seg>

<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seym Teshome, a lecturer in the Ethiopians." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation is Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are plenty of complaints that cover everything from the ground to the digging in relation to power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a fight for these glare, controversial line took in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">The analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were enforced in the last years more or less, the turmoil can be removed and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitration after years of shooting under the surface is explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones have been increasingly more likely and improved their internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, so many people can communicate over the Internet-proxies, which conceal where they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they were gathered together to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Equal prospered, the Amharas, which come from Athopia mainly Christian countries, in the politics and economy, while they carried out the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the shops and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Until his death in 2012, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the disease of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">The analysts say that he was especially tolerated in this, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special experts to edit opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing from this fundamentalist" "", "Mr. Abdi, a conflict analysis." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, as Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of north country, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysis of analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia had experienced an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to information from analytics, apparently and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protestants were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that period of disturbances passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopians Ethiopians leaders for its visionary infrastructure, such as the new Pendlerenes, as well as for their measurable advances at the poverty level.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it obviously has not the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month the protests in gondar, an amsevere city, of Tigray managed shops and hatred opposite the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysis of analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used to use Ethiopia as a base for Dronenoid on the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently admitted that it has closed this basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama called ISIS, "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy on Friday that his campaign returns that his several times repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder, of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification rejected new questions about communication capabilities of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow countrymen who make an effort to take him during an eventful phase in protection, in which the property could explain to them that he could not have been meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hinge on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the statement on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really didn't intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a early moratorium on Friday, Mr. Trump, he was simply Sardinian.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought the excuse perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radicated Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, wanted nothing to do anything about the Republican presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism is based on Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling down values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan, during this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump was trying to return again to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he had boring their speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he withdrew large critique when he thought, the Russians should tell Mrs. Clinics Emails, but he later declared "Natalia."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits to the policy and then forward to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they come, and then," clarifies "according to what the reaction falls." "" "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both Candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vage enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the sound for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even bloobious sound, since its modifications have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was released on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying to make excuse for his provocation, he charged his critics often, to understand his testimonies, or to understand his humour humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps have brought his loyals Mitzzer into the uncomfortable situation, to be able to stand irrespective of what provocant may like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent interventions, there was great efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said it to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is in this sense true that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-feathers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government was under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton used as Foreign Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread, to spread the situation in the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's usually occur only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the Sanna research team.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - till today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland tower is situated along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he comes on average 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seals.</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of loneliness stained lifestyle seems to be a patch for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen was born from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" at any event that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scout of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life-range which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionist biologist assumed that Greenland will be very old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hair is difficult to observe, finally they live especially in the ice-sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius, they occur in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle we know some little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-bends left them, when they took six animals in front of valbard for six animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the prey make these sharks, but in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed up the pbone of a young icebreakers.</seg>
<seg id="19">Probably, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look Kadaver, which forks out of higher water layers beneath the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as cover from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 cm measure.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the linkcore of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye drops already before the birth of the sharks, which contained in the proteins later anymore.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth should be in the atmosphere according to the early 1960s, when atomic tests attempts to swap this radioactive carbon s into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which with 220 centimeters in length, the liner core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all the larger Greenland animals had normal carbon-14 amounts caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was to be a 493 centimeters long Greenland, an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters could be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be at the threshold for the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland with the increase of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusales live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, on the neck a 120-year old harpoon tip, was captured in Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures there is often the organism that living animals living there on sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slower slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller beast lives together and should focus on it as possible as many children as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Business between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the repeal of sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levin Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran, grew by 70.9 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions imposed on Iran, the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country, divided the ambassadors.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies take existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to provide access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran fell in the first five months of the year 2016 by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015, rising to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, the Russian imports increased by 91.5 percent, and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade shift was achieved by deliveries of machines, agricultural vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan runs out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russian foreign representations made around 35,000 Visas, primarily associated with Reisevisas, an Iranian citizen.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached top 20 of the countries, representing the number of places in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">You may say that the record number of Irish tourists must be broken in Russia from the past year, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy Winner - and Skinner put an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the final round, the New Zealander in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was scarcely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and back to Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a major part of the transformation, in case of adding in a higher corridor to slow it down and to make it wrong and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will again be able to create new opportunities for the local and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs will create new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As it was ahead of us in London 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be willing for the games and that we'll be blamusing ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answered every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">The expansion is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to swearing and create a legacy of skills and employment in both around the airport and throughout the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which was converted by a £11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, which was built in the midst of the two frequented treadmills of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third running steg, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we will expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow, as well as with our future trade and create a legacy of manufacturing and employment, which can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model in order to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorithms to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine if the Venus might even be erased with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-densities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously showed that the slow movement of Venus might be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere, and yet to follow slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet, probably more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected even faster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-model simulation, the slow movement of Venus will expands its daily page of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is heated the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which appears like a umbrella on the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by Planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably livable, the Venus -- was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you withdrew Hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator revealed software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the aim, but the change to company attage was terrified quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, you are looking forward to inlong changed files like Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted with the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the press.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the cratic towing bit.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where with private use, the personal photo database is based on the game, it goes to firms for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the loss falls off if a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies affected lower sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent had to break down their business activities, in case of a case people were affected in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims," "" "you don't pay, you only promotes the problem," "" "says Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators to reject the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researcher from F-Secure examined the user-up and contact with the press releases: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will explain their victims by chat, as you can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, private professionals have redeemed according to payments of a few hundred million euros, companies have to pay partly hard-negotiation and five-digit sums to get their data inkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">Considering the potentially high and relatively risikless gains from the Ransomware detection, the hackers are always professional and share the work, "Security experts Chester Wisniewski, from the Internet provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their contaminants in the form of a software box to the actual stress of the software.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "included in the scope of supply is a adapting tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed" "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The stress look for another hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So in one of the forums in the underground, the set is bought by a crime and commissioned another way to install the software as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made by means of a modified machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the crime shall then carry out spelling and proving," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies who get their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes survey, based on a ransomware by file-back-ups and scans software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not provide sufficient threat to successful recovery more, the perpetrators will replied with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing culations," explained Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential potential of potential for the type of data even more much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the perpetrators also could take full new targets on the Internet of Things (in future).</seg>
<seg id="43">On the request of the dispute, defcon demonstrated a safety forger, such as the thermostat to the Internet connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the throttle of a derous heating could be well worth a ransom for a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators started to block a whole production street in the future as a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty much overload, but the HR V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, there is no place close to either.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inner space are well finished and have a pleasant, only the cockpit side falls into something.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 L for high-handed and 1026 l with folded back bent back, but there is the "Magic Seats".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical, as it sounds: the seat areas of the backbench can be folded as Kinosessel and thus provide storage space, which is high up to the ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, it is likely to keep his job a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine power supply: a 1.5 liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ride is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering element is likely to be direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment is not open to the top version "Executive" in the tested top version.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system belongs to the City of security systems (working until tempo 32), the collision system and the trace processor.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes the collisions irritated sometimes because it was evaluated many obstacles as "herannahent objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works for remote control.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegulators reacts on traffic signs and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top-equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI jack lie below the armrest and are therefore a little bit awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Whoever does not want to invest in so much will receive the gasoline from 20,000 Euro, the diesel starting at 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you roll down forever, at night there is stunnach for hours, in the morning it is not far to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep problems and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanent as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there can be many different reasons, emphasising Hans-Günter Weber, a member of the board member of the German society for sleeping and sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understandable among them is, but the insomnie, so is an infirmament and a sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just to sleep, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Haussmann association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological, or-related factors can also be put on medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disturbing expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often very often at an depression" "" "says Weep." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors form one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, has a bandment failure, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours, and begin to salvable, about everyday problems and help make a sweep, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleep problems for the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impacted on the day, the doctor should take revenge.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look different: one is crushed, tired, undisturbed, has difficulty with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has vocal fluctuations or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to adapt to sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, different behavioural changes, cognitive behavior, or drugs - classic stroke lettering only occur in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly any unmaintained dormitories of Prof. Ingo Fires, director of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should contact with sleeping difficulties at first, at first, take revenge.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, the problems can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should walk in the slaughter, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in slaughter or medical care, for example, in snoring with breathing exercises, in case of disease-tiring, at bedtime or if you don't find the cause of a sleepingness, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">In reality, you do not have to prepare.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>

<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as is called Friedrichshain, will be illustrated with compromising cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of the rental contracts, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin's insenator handle had been specially designed for a hard demonstration of the police against the project against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the premises were cleared in the ground floor, the Kadtermithy, with 300 police officers, was patrouded parts of the streets with 30 to 40 officers and three team wagon on site, unlocked parts of the road and managed to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, its renovated building workers in the order of unknown houses the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went down under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk along with children, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others keep going to late.</seg>
<seg id="12">Primary school and kindergartens are situated in the immediate vicinity of the zone.</seg>

<seg id="19">While the mainboard had been cleared under a large police force, many of the projects have been legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district of the last few years has become increasingly important for tourists and electoral liner from around the world: now residents of GDR times and former housekeeper have become their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable during the rental period, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: they detects them in swapped slices or freshly painted facades that were thrown into colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned as often in this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that, not all the neighbors could see that as a problem, could not necessarily be affected by the crime of criminal offences such as body infringement, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offences make atomic facts, which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a home house next to the contested 94, uncertainty can be no talk.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which are not intended to have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous combuing cars do not give it directly to the Rīga no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For having studied Architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the inhabitants have recovered their streets: by the police, the politics and the media, in July, all of them suddenly conquered the Deutungshoness of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of some habitations such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by a smiling newbuilds in former building gaps that forge the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are at the end of the apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people living so well," "" "says she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction may be absolutely uncontestandy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if anyone does not listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">He has relied on all sides of frustration, also in the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those that are offended in colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws up, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a bar-quarter, can be poorly chargeable to noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All people only asked with prenames are asked, not to be called with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is new refugee</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuverle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisator.</seg>
<seg id="3">She also is a social worker in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuverle has been the refugee institution for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogy supports the team of the administration of Achim Grozberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She looks as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee aid, administration, authorities and those else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client of the Arbeitskreis indicates that the honour of honour is more thankful that Deuverle is now there, the eagerly wowerchsau that has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less sparing compared to the multitude of wishing problems - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a talent with a talent for languages and people, linked to many years of experience in the field of social work, just an enchanted Wollchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not their central area, means Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, there is an organization, working with the people on the spot, and behind the scenes and network materials.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31 year old has been in existence for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a 50-percent job on three years term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was tallest time," says Regine Client that Annika Deuverle Honour and the official actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A significant problem it is for some time to find homes for the connection convolatings which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the junction of the connection, the communes are competent.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accept the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the community itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is replaced by the Council and of the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been a very difficult time for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It did not work until now, however, be dependent on private apartments, as Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the apartments must be carded as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon, new containers will be installed in the wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are vocational training places, training places, training places, A-euro jobs and savings for refugees and migrants who need to be spotted or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, restarted nonprofit work - and motivated and very neat as Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work will lead to the community for a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But he doesn't work just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a courageous feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So you need to do offers like sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So please skip here to manage and volunteer here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It may be central that the refugees get the feeling, they would be welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to refugees that it will take time and they can make the time meaningful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">If you feel the feeling of development, he could not help in Urbach, don't want to work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is also problems to be honest, "people said," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuverle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this would be a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after the recent present fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "no," "" "says the customer clearly states" "" "what lack of naive is" "". "a remaining risk could not be able to exclude them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the terrorist attacks bring them complete.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers have to look for a volunteer in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new collision could come to refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To respond to this question, the policy is discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been utilized, to integrate existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young males.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, they are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
