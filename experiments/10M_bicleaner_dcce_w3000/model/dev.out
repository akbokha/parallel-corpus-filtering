Obama welcome Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relation between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just so friendly .
these two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Teheran on the measures in the Middle East .
around the conflict , however , there is also around the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states @-@ solution .
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement structure of Israel and for Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s un@@ conditional will in peace process .
with the deal struck by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had given a controversial speech to the American congress , which was named as an affair with Obama .
the talk was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected with reference to the upcoming elections in Israel .
in an emergency call is Professor to having shot his girlfriend just
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon waited with a somewhat lighter voice of police , that he shot his girlfriend and that his servants would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb is it important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably he said , the family @-@ contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house hosted the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten notes written on a white block : &quot; I felt so tired , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississippi , already taught about 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he was shot and killed an advanced history professor , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University of the Lyn@@ n , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the university &apos;s staff is at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call already at some time .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took off the life when the police care him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and instru@@ ctors were forced to hide himself behind closed doors , the authorities still try to pro@@ cure a picture of them just the Lamb .
the details that were published by the investigations into the two ends of the state , as well as those who knew what were students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were on their lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ ele died , he did not have a history of violence or criminal proceedings .
for it , Schmidt itself had written record in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; when he shared his academic life .
both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose fac@@ ulty comprises 17 members and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were several tenden@@ cies about problem@@ atic behavi@@ oral aspects .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who praised , he also seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Syrians told him that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons behind and have said that he has any health problem .
this year he just taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university noted that the promotion for the Lamb had worked as hard for him , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Department of Ophthalmology , William La@@ FOR@@ ge , acknowledged nothing by a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ia &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is questions that can &apos;t answer the Lamb .
after her escape from the Campus police , the police went back to Lam@@ bs , when he arrived in Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , in Washington County Cor@@ oner Minister , Johnson .
his car ran even on the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house but Johnson showed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , having received 3,500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught educational and education .
he received his doctorate in pe@@ dagog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ term friends of Lam@@ bs , it was intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when they met together as a joint friend .
she and her friends were at High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach you the guitar game .
that was the time of the Frauen@@ insel at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted when he was there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ele were out of course a few times .
in the emergency call waited &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from an marriage .
you had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the Back@@ stone house which joins a Ba@@ ob@@ in in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the Ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ ill , Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends left and one daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but I heard Ab@@ ig@@ ail , the daughter of Ab@@ ig@@ ail that Lamb was also interested in music and blues .
Lamb is Lamb who , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met three years ago in a summer season .
later on they played together the one or other G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he writing his daughter and sings its own music .

Mike Sha@@ ker , a b@@ art@@ ender and often entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit night near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished guitar and harmon@@ ica ends before a sp@@ er audience in the night of 5 September .
there was no indication that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the rooms and were che@@ ating .

Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Sol@@ is reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississippi .
Associated Press , Emil@@ y Pi@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect upon that the police now states that from the emergency call it was shot by the police , and that the Lamb was shot in his emergency call away from his wife but there was no indication of that the two had been married .

UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says that the answer of Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years in conflict , and more weapons will appreciate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN CEO is calling for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and to support integ@@ rative talks to find a political solution .

8 The values that are caused by Donald Tr@@ ump is to be taken seriously .
some have tried to push it a flop .
others have treated it as a joke .
and some of them wait for a collapse .
however , no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper part of the pol@@ ls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls received Donald Tr@@ ump into the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask serious about what the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ulate came .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys received the lead to the rising of Herman Cain , of which no one had also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general election .
but out@@ put@@ ty groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Grow@@ th now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps Exp@@ end@@ able assets and start their dollar to run it .
here are some current surrounding values , pointing out that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps most popular tr@@ ons have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans have seen the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view by Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinions .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ pi@@ ac @-@ tuning in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P were happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be entitled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
they would only say two of 10 , they would be &quot; offended , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages to say the same enthusiasm like pot@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same thing against Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in the field of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters said that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; per@@ pen@@ ess , if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see a question as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely ration@@ alised for his unexpected and inten@@ ding statements , 52 per cent of the ruling Irish voters think that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the correct temper@@ ament for president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre @-@ bal@@ lot of the nation , the Federal State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans knew that he had the personality of a commander as in Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effective his office and almost six out of 10 independent authorities say that his temper@@ ament is not given in the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters acc@@ li@@ mat@@ h to the idea .
when they keep their sp@@ ill , he can hold out more Republi@@ can voters for real .
in case they are asked to win the GO@@ P @-@ Nom@@ ination by a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this has been a change since the time , when four of ten entries started their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full publication : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ s that Rick Perry had won the nom@@ ination would get more than 28 % of the final candidate of Mit@@ ney .
nonetheless , it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P @-@ voters has to take a campaign as a pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans took up a level , Tr@@ ump is still strike any way .
a number of experts predi@@ ct that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field is likely to lead to Tr@@ um@@ ps guidance , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump is re@@ aping multiple support .
he pointed before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before the Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would bring down the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the tr@@ ump is that they have forgiven their vote .
of course can happen , of course , to change this , and no one can really say , never change your mind .
46 percent said they let the door open , to move to other candidates .
yet , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most pot@@ ent competition at the moment of the other outer se@@ mit@@ es , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as many as tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are to agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign , Mc@@ Donald Tr@@ ump claimed a &quot; rape crisis &quot; two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course went into 2016 .
some are concerned that the impact could make an expression of a dump of Tr@@ um@@ ano @-@ Americans by the Repub@@ lics of the Repub@@ lics , and that the new @-@ oriented effort is dam@@ aging .
but according to the new ABC / post @-@ survey conducted by Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s that they agree with tr@@ ump issues related to immigration .
as long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight was abandoned , Donald Tr@@ ump is now also to do so .
the fru@@ stration and embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ment of the government is climbing on new top states .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there will be about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters in 2014 , especially spur@@ red on by its field jacket .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s say by ABC / post in the new Fri@@ days survey , they prefer to use an political under@@ age than someone with government experience .
and they are also ra@@ ged in Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa for two weeks ago reveals that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated by four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans with 54 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wooden heads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt &amp; Co . : the most exclusive residential areas of Germany
the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ium in the Hob@@ se@@ weg are the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ium , with sea view over the North Sea .
the road costs an area of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros per square meter .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is certain &quot; it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows what special areas will cost one square meter most .
of course , up to 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student union in Munich are not really a little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , it includes one of the best as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service Angel &amp; League has released a ran@@ kings to the most exclusive German residential area - including square met@@ ig@@ matic heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , log@@ ically noted .

Müller made his first hit in the Champions League to the Bayern @-@ Leadership Team , Roberto , who had set up a f@@ lange thinking of the master of the world .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game at the Kar@@ ai@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 with the invitation and the Munich held .
they had a concentrated and fixed performance , without a shiny object .
Pi@@ raeus won the youngest six perform games in the Royal class , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Beck proud here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , were defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they went to be bra@@ ve , in their open efforts , often to do it too works .
the attacks were wr@@ ist too often by playing over@@ l@@ apping on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , which was sel@@ dom crushed against the earlier Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ del@@ l@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller had more fortun@@ ate at the right , when the flan@@ k left the right @-@ circle in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion delivered the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half an had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympic bat@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown beat the head of Poland by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct tap , the goal was Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
though the Bayern was acc@@ ust@@ omed to domin@@ ate the game , Pi@@ raeus could set you a bl@@ ame .
but at the por@@ ter Manuel New one was compar@@ ative .
about this , when he de@@ fle@@ cted an idea of Ide@@ as through the lan@@ ders ( 5@@ 6th ) .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola recently left a square with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , home to mus@@ cular problems in Ka@@ isa , sat at the first time outside .
the World Cup team has only given me green light after the conclu@@ ding training , Mr. W@@ ant has said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something different from it , is already mal@@ icious . &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to show a King@@ sley Com@@ an on the hand@@ cu@@ l Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Go@@ th@@ o was too late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made another penet@@ rate .
it was in front of the game in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly covered Bayern @-@ Fans in their viewer @-@ block , the tra@@ ilers of violence Pi@@ raeus having arrested the security forces and went out with dr@@ unk@@ ers around the Munich trailer .

who is smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of dying ...
those who smoke , folds not only the lung , but also the teeth - that is close to Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : when refer@@ end@@ ings , the risk goes rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
the project consists of a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly decreased by 2.@@ 5 to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
primary causes of tooth dec@@ ay are ble@@ eding and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ ise the DI@@ B@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this par@@ od@@ ont@@ itis is smoking .
the relationship between smoking and tooth dec@@ ay is therefore caused to frequent g@@ um of the disease at smo@@ kers .
not to clari@@ fy , smoking is also raised the risk of car@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking with the smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ an@@ gering reach the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the first Thomas called Thomas Dietrich of the English university .
people had to convince humans of what non@@ smo@@ kers and explained the study of H@@ einer &apos;s Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking lasted the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and medium and leads to our insights too good health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 % of the population aged 65 to 74 years old are affected by denti@@ ality , the DI@@ E@@ E divided them .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking indeed incre@@ ment the risk for very early loss .
the new long @-@ term study guide the findings .

EU Commission proposes in the dispute about the TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to be replaced by the F@@ TA Group TT@@ IP .
the controversial private cloud facility for legal disputes between corporate and states must therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , corresponding to a considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to whom the citizen trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the responsible EU Commissioner in Cec@@ ilia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to the proposal to introduce European negoti@@ ating positions as European negoti@@ ating positions with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
however , the plans to reform the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure may observe that the EU states and the US are acqu@@ iring adequate judges for a new service .
in addition , they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to raise against judgments .
until now , the trial involved have agreed upon refer@@ ee , a g@@ im@@ possibility against their sentences , there was not one .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not rely on the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , it plans to address an International Investment Court .
there , for example , disputes between the Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied in this case .
the sole reason for the large investments in Europe against the TT@@ IP , especially from large investments by the Invest@@ or &apos; Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) , is considered one of the main reasons in Europe .
the traditional arbit@@ ration cards are criti@@ ci@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , and syn@@ dic@@ als the tax pay@@ ers , national law , or target a cutting of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments of anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals of the EU Commission have in@@ adequate .
for the time , free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) should be considered criti@@ ci@@ zed .
the German economy of State Matthias Mach@@ ans ( SPD ) was described by the others on the other hand as major progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission Con@@ sider fundamental points , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was at the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Bul@@ k .
the European business association Bus@@ in@@ ess@@ Europe warned against limit@@ ing the needs of the economy by a lot of new rules .
it was particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises as well as ad@@ ver@@ sely affected by it .
when the discussions come to the free trade agreement ( TT@@ IP ) ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , the TT@@ IP remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have run since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of Invest@@ ors &quot; was not discussed yet with the United States so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .

for 11 years , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens has set on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition , fli@@ p@@ chart is indicated next to it , a fli@@ p@@ chart , which closely recorded a felt of the picturesque USA State Michigan .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken with Stev@@ ens &apos;s presentation .
it tells of several places that he reports on the map , what more than his min@@ u@@ cial and delicate songs report .
where they were created , and how it looks , in his home country .
since then Stev@@ ens has made himself a wonderful po@@ unding .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear cle@@ ver songs , which blend harmon@@ ious very close to American folk music of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states must be consul@@ ted in succession .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already been released , positi@@ vely asc@@ ends on a positi@@ vely high expectations .
get down Stev@@ ens here .
Live only for guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician returns to the show in New York .
address associated with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ l@@ oise &quot; ) in 2005 .
over@@ crow@@ ding in ideas and culture finding .
the album climbed up to the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any one of the most influ@@ ential music media in the list .
in addition to more productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively .
this sixth overall studio album is still extensive orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all the effects and hall .
from the smaller club , the stage shows the show shows back to the colorful spect@@ acle of ne@@ on @-@ wall and large fluorescent st@@ aging stage .
currently Y@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is currently part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
held in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests were banned in their seats , the Stev@@ ens comes back to in@@ tim@@ acy and back to folk music .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play the wide enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears the audience : the talk was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only too a addition , Stev@@ ens is humble , plays an even older songs and it moves up to tos@@ ses appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has been playing the prime minister of the Prime Minister with excitement since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should make his debut with David Cameron &apos;s parliamentary vote and brought David Cameron for the first time with David Cameron .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be finding the first of its six pre @-@ entered questions to noon , with which the media is likely to be controlled by the media and the Labour ME@@ P .
he has called for &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary report to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because she comes after being a member of the shadow of the shadow and will be held in the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday following his appointment .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party was confirmed on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , criti@@ que , criti@@ que by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and is located at the core of several cover pages covering in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing the National An@@ them , has pushed attention to it
a speaker spoke by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he was recognized by the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party secured him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s correspon@@ dent for the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also known within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements about the position of the European Union and the current limit .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that gives the Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith said , the shadow working and rit@@ er minister that the party would be very clear , &quot; it is only against governmental plans to lower its limit from 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 2@@ 3.000 .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chairman who became David Cameron &apos;s CEO ever since he has over T@@ ory CEO over the last decade across the D@@ isp@@ atch @-@ Box over the Parliament .
the Labour Party , who promised another policy letter , says that he has set &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ resources &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron &apos;s ideas to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP proves that the break@@ even of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that he has to undergo &quot; head@@ land &quot; and the spreading of resistance strug@@ gles to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela is represented by Angela eagle , the shadow of business ministers , if he does not take part - for example , when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea into a conversation , that other colleagues occasionally work the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ tha , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he has been linked to politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ ern@@ le Theatre &quot; which often has been linked to the prime minister of Prime Minister . but a few years later he thought that he was denied it .
since she was at first aired on television in 1990 , the parliamentary question was seen by Prime Minister and his leadership in the Lower building and its position among its parliam@@ ents , although critics have ar@@ gued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ul@@ ating and require far reaching re@@ forms .

met@@ cash begins bottom @-@ milling campaign for com@@ b@@ ating alkal@@ i inj@@ ections
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A @-@ branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million US invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are preparing their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A trade fair by mainst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as on events like Adelaide .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice @-@ manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that sell distributed and sold in IG@@ A @-@ shops , sell tickets to loyal customers for the South Australian football League .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released for more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices passes through its annual investors .
it is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charges and generate more profit@@ ability than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
single purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial parliam@@ ents and IG@@ A retail@@ ers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 per cent among the Eastern states .
but , analysts such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di leaves out twelve months after the opening of its first markets in these two states , and all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retail@@ ers will take away .
a report published in this week would estimate that the analysts &quot; analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ om of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retail@@ ers could lose around $ 360 million in cash and a cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based upon the assumption that Al@@ di has in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and achieve sales of $ 500 million and a $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and market in the amounts to Met@@ a@@ ash@@ s of high fixed prices could cost around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath by Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , despite a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ One is the most tru@@ sty .
Morgan Stanley is on the increase of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s in food and market by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was one of the business in Melbourne that met@@ cash will likely disappear in a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass , Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass started in touch with Mr Dou@@ glass .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food business , which represents approx . 1,200 IG@@ A retail@@ ers , has been fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which con@@ vey its operating debt to revenues and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers we@@ bin@@ ed and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to generate sales of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week to improve the IG@@ A retail@@ ers when improving quality fresh food and supply a better selection of private @-@ label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs for Elan have become and hopes that the Grand fun@@ ct in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
thanksgiving Linda Heal@@ y is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ k@@ kal@@ kin@@ is is rather praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Di@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; Coll@@ ateral Damage . &quot; in the quick@@ est storm around his friend Nick C@@ ani and earns his way to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation . Steve Heal@@ y is rather praise than criticism for its own behavior .
co@@ ca@@ da@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always designated as &quot; Special KS &quot; , drawn by the not@@ orious argument that C@@ yri@@ l played with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a cont@@ est@@ ly qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison must be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator , with Har@@ rison answered : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have gone astray , and I should punch my baby . &quot;
while he was last seen how he dis@@ gu@@ ised a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ater was depos@@ ed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , he was defended by Heal@@ thcare is defended by Heal@@ thcare is defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic for the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; one thing about which I am quite irrit@@ ated , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ am was caught a little into the battle , &quot; Heal@@ y said .
he has broken a bat , as he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ os in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of Fr@@ ust himself , and I know Than@@ ks well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , indeed , it really happened in the US Open extremely well , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team round about him , he has a great family around him and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated .
he is a very hard 19 @-@ year @-@ old he works very tough and he fits in the team and so on he &apos;s never hit a problem with the other players , he &apos;s being good in the shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves it , according to his own services .
Heal@@ y supported also the decision by comm@@ enting on the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent part into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition , and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; C@@ yri@@ l &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick showed up very fast the asc@@ ension , on which people like to make music like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray , and he has made some bad mistakes which he can try , but we try to think him can think that , and it is best for the crew and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s best for him .
in Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares Not@@ ice , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares its case and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all who tried to arrive illegal into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos pursued at the border as hundreds of migrants did deal in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ es@@ land , and Serb police officers re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled before violence were set @-@ up for an unknown period in a land on the street between the two control points , built and settled there .
but fruit rose on .
when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ing over them , the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and the charges le@@ aked against the Hungarian polic@@ eman sh@@ rou@@ per .
some pointed out the food and water .
Serbian Foreign Minister declared that migrants coming from Hungary should be returned to Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving .
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a Coll@@ ateral Damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must take place in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ old blo@@ c no common immigration policy at an disputed union meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the ex@@ ag@@ ated Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that the EU states would have further 120.000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union in order to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent on Tuesday .
but Hungary pursued its hopes for a single @-@ hour action in Brussels or its neighbors .
the case that was declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to conquer the crisis , causing roads to un@@ lock her streets and mig@@ rate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has put the construction of a bar@@ bed wire bar@@ bed around the border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after that it has ended a fence on the Serb border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata told , that even prison packs were used in the competition , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable engagement and entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed it that most of the upcoming economic operators are that are searching for a better life , and not war @-@ fle@@ ctors who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contra@@ diction to other EU states including Germany .
the new laws created by midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high gate to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws shall impos@@ e higher conditions of imprisonment for traff@@ icking in human tra@@ ders .
&quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the application of the military , yet for the next week , but repor@@ ter of the Associated Press is to have seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ safety consultant for Or@@ ban , said that in order to cross the border with 45 people on attempts to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated into the country .
they came close by going to the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting of pen@@ gu@@ ards after the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence rapidly .
Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border crossing with Serbia in the morning , after a train at the tractor arrived using bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos linked the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , to process the data of people and pushed a human hand to push himself there .
about 20 succeeded to get in , but thousands were defeated outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would like to refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton maintains a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is winning against the ground .
Clinton has now received the support of 47 per cent of democratic voters during the pres@@ election ( 58 per cent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , will receive support for the Presi@@ dential mandate for support of 15 percent of the democratic voters .
over five months before the onset of the preliminary election , most of the democratic voters say that it is too early in order to say that their opinion is recognized that candidates will assist them .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News pol@@ l , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while others gained some profit .
Clinton holds a large lead in women and mixture , but its origins have been reduced .
their support to the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is only covered with 5 points .
Clin@@ t benefit in some democratic voters under the age of 50 , and her and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton still has a big lead in the older voters .
in the past month Clinton used his number with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in that group .
some half of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election , saying that they would support Egypt if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some pre@@ judi@@ ces , and another 15 percent would solely support them because she is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising because Clin@@ &apos;s recent supporters are all enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger , for those who are currently not supporting - just about a quarter would support them .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters say they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters reported this over their peak @-@ channel Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) .
if Clin@@ ics supporters in an open question , why they want the candidates to be the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , her contact with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
agreement with the problems and the vot@@ ion of comments are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president casts a potential for the Presi@@ dential mandate , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe he was not going to do it .
when democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den at the top .
more than half of the Clinton &apos;s tra@@ ilers say that Bi@@ den was their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if bi@@ ans decided not to kan@@ to@@ ise for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead was increased by 20 points , with bi@@ ds in competition at 30 points without him in the race .
sixty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton in favour with the best chances to win the election ; however this figure dropped from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that is an@@ gled to him than the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , at the question of what a candidate is more important , the Democratic voters call themselves about the voters .
similarly , in the last month , no single democr@@ at candidate or potential candidate cho@@ oses the voters as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidate provide good results in some important characteristics of voters in the elections of their party .
key Fig@@ ures in Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den become tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong man@@ qual@@ ities .
with the three candidates , bi@@ ds cut the lead in favour of honour , while Clin@@ &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton &apos;s tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy is twice as many say that by S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe in him .
in general , Clinton &apos;s democratic voters will generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion from S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to aband@@ on the address of a personal email address and one server as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters of the pre@@ ference be pleased with their statement of the matter and say that there has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion occurred in March , shortly after the problem appeared to light .
most Americans reported that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not have any impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion about it had wor@@ sen@@ ed .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , greater than six of 10 , who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is widely viewed as tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is still a problem for it under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of those entitled voters do not stick with tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the constitu@@ ency affected are still too honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes at the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush came out best when arriving .
a majority looks to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many no opinion about him .
the fault rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump , closer to Donald Tr@@ ump .
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS news / New York Times , behind Donald Tr@@ ump .
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters falls in the new survey and others lose dramatic support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in great numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted using Fox News debate in the past month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired at the same time interval between 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well approaching at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass the ump of un@@ republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ j@@ at , has been hit by Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest recession , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor , Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place .
the fault mar@@ gins of the sample of 376 persons from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son works in the pol@@ ls - he arrives at 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
having regard to one in the last week of increasing Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump reported a number of page names for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son decided to issue the rebels in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even when the maximum values are measured just beyond the distance , just a trip to the Mediterranean , should be provided for warm water .
a bad climate is likely to be real pleasure in the North or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees .
no more goes into the sea : the maximum of 18 degrees is divided into the North and Baltic Se@@ as in this week , by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
however , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in Adriatic sea level is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes up to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charge the death of a Bar@@ uch College symbols .
almost two years after a student during a film rite , during a student union of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ ment had filed against five .
members of the New York State College of P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood &quot; Ch@@ un &quot; was brut@@ ally attacked and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death in September 2013 .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with the old eyes of a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack , and has been subjected to repeatedly , while he was trying to turn on a frozen field to his goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about heada@@ ches , and then he fell into un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta p@@ si people did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g p@@ opp@@ y was strong and supposed to wait an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , have its symptoms goo@@ gle@@ aned and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to initi@@ ate advice , chief manager Chris Wagner said on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members started to hide products and set the bro@@ therhood in general of the decision about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police officers .
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning by his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy @-@ report Den@@ g has been repeatedly added to the force , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student , since 1970 , he died every year to the Sch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer with the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
bro@@ ods and its members must be to be held to account , and this step of the authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury , Monroe , recommended an indictment due to murder of third counts for the first five members .
two and thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of having sh@@ y attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we do not only want to make support of the involved persons , but if there is an organization , which - officially or un@@ officially - this , we will also draw them to the account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the bro@@ therhood , and the Brotherhood rejected her affili@@ ation to the local societies .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises the interest
a t@@ ines comes , and the house will be thrown into the che@@ eks , to return to bonds , and the economy will be a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long that will last and how long it will take .
especially the history of the economy does not offer low instructions for exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came after only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing business and financial assets .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank proposed that investors should not concentrate on it , when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for normal@@ ization .
in fact several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was possibly ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a higher interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julian Jes@@ sop , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal high@@ s , but still rely on low level , to se@@ is@@ mic shock , that many seem to be feared to guide .
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical landmark based on historical activities , how some areas of the economy should react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate can be more vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to total wealth from 12 to 24 months after the first increase of interest , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts at a recent study to what after Zin@@ ser@@ tations of the F@@ ed happens .
in more detail , the market has mostly seen in upward trend during the past 35 years , and then back to the normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six preceding cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss , was released by Nu@@ ron Asset Management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impacts on the shares occur later in the real cycle and returns the margin to decrease .
Rez@@ essions are a matter of business of economic , but zinc increases often carry them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that had not existed before and saw a recession .
it is very interesting that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product was the lowest point in its lowest point at a Zin@@ ser@@ tion of the F@@ ed .
according to the German bank , 118 percent of these nominal GDP growth remained below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , expect only few that this will take and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter of the Atlanta .
zinc increases in frag@@ ile economic scenes could risk @-@ risk and throw the question , &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants were prepared for the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were foc@@ ussed on the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the Fut@@ ures trade accounts for only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study all real cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in the GDP , and on @-@ rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ation very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is un@@ clear recovery of what the worst recession observed in the observ@@ atory phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest which has under@@ gone by the F@@ ed since the end of the recession ; record was 35 months , and this is 74 months so far .
the strong income was also vol@@ at@@ ile because the market increases a higher interest rate , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than that of shares when their strategic course change .
as bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the fall @-@ cycle , the bond returns immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Sw@@ ab@@ i believe that the increase in the interest rate is estimated to close ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a short@@ fall of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often have a better climate , although &quot; we are c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come An@@ al@@ cul@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an Analysis .
interesting is that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stri@@ c@@ est monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates has risen , the yield curve is sh@@ allow@@ er , credit gest@@ ures , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility is increased - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the big and whole company , companies that t@@ let@@ up the bigger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an ascending and raise its products on the global market and are just the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react three months after an initial interest rate extremely positive , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ Analy@@ st said in a report to customers .
companies with strong balance sheet exceeded the average interest rate of 5 percentage points after each of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital re@@ ties and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares even exceed their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
Spar@@ er could see gains by higher income , even if experts are different opinion , as soon as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament &apos;s member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gued that he is not differenti@@ ate to tell any commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped at the BBC Music Awards , saying that she has just been a member of The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins for the report The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; converts &apos; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Member States and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything the private broad@@ caster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC P@@ ingham to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ um@@ ms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or more of its commercial compet@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; T@@ um@@ ms &quot; not like - but it seems to turn Classic FM to transform , &quot; he said .
he also was launching the BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to appear just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , where you only have im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General , pointed out the alle@@ g@@ ations and ar@@ gued that BBC Radio 3 is far off its commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music at anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music , and new works in order , I think also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller support Alan Dav@@ ey said that it had to be worked hard to engage in the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are in@@ forms about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire , fell into the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
Collins @-@ Members of Collins , The Voice of Dam@@ ien roman@@ ches - the musical talent show at BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ ers Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall consisted of that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as the judges - &quot; produced a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , it had to find that the company hit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our house of house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it puts the next time a fun series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the order has refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in a future or to give money to the l@@ ac@@ l@@ ent formats for other maintenance formats .
Internet sales rose in August on the slow@@ est and the Black Friday could be responsible .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month was the lowest result since the time of records in 2000
online sales enhanced 30 years ago through the use of mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has hin@@ dered the issues .
for over a decade the virtual items have been drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate when new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate while new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and back up to 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , said the gu@@ ardian of the IM@@ RG &apos;s sale .
he stated that online sales were reinforced with more than three years ago , as a buyer , with their mobile phones , to make purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example , at home on the sofa .
but now we comm@@ utes a change , and we may experience it reduces growth .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the complete sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep its purchases before the event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers will be about their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some other retail@@ ers have already r@@ ushed out .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could claim for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop its purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that a cost of £ 5 billion has been issued online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases is now made via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online in the inner cities .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the date of the cheaper East European craftsmen is passing by
Brit@@ ons are investing craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified people from Eastern Europe has rising up
and this leads to the fact that 200 more screens we have to go on tra@@ des@@ people of the tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets are located throughout the country .
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , the chief correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
it is said that Brit@@ ons carry out its h@@ ammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified East European handi@@ crafts which perform the work in their home
you can be sent to a minority in a hammer or a brush to bottom walls , so you belong to a minority .
at the British , Britain are investing professionals in order to perform DIY jobs within their houses , so the company &apos;s boss decided behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the overall steel chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer the services to deep prices today has out@@ dated .
it is therefore plans to open King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other screens and to close the tra@@ des@@ men and set up 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry told her to deal more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten stores in the store are hit by women .
at the moment the men survived the men .
she said it was necessary to show@@ case the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more women &apos;s single @-@ homes , more than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we need to shift this stronger to a balance .
in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of all decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women on the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also surro@@ unds the top team in order to reflect the same number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied only 50 per cent of the team with women , including management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women on our actions .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in the half year net profit and the sales , after the Group applied the costs for the closing of the shops .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
work of a@@ ich / D@@ ob because of un@@ faithfulness against justice
at the Regional Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday , two function of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ vi@@ ctors will have to answer for lack of commitment and spending .
the def@@ endants were not found guilty .
one of them had been accused of abuse of authority .
on the occasion of this accus@@ ation , he was acquitted in May .
the current process has been postponed .
according to the Public Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffer was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose of the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2011 , for which they were allowed to disp@@ ose to private purposes .
he will reduce the damage with 400.000 euros in total .
the sports club are also charged with financial support .
this latter was divided into the group of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the betra@@ y of un@@ faithfulness the defence argument that the association was not ar@@ isen on any other time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports @-@ functional had only been prohib@@ itions and the sports club , which they worked from 1982 @-@ 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money raised from debt - the liabilities were produced in 2001 by approximately 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 € ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : would we like to keep the club or block further ? , &quot; then , one of the accused , in the corn@@ erst@@ el of the financial community , told me .
he decided to take this task , as well as his co @-@ accused and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have compens@@ ed money , our life insur@@ ances as safety placed on the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he in the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , there may only be no debt .
also , due to the appropriate financial statement , the payment of the damages for damages is approved by the end of 1991 .
therefore , some of the fee @-@ damages not only years later , namely from the year 2003 , have been paid out as an increase on the account .
hence package - and non @-@ det@@ ach@@ able stress , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes .
the accounts and au@@ ster@@ ity administered the two accused , the second accused .
why the dis@@ bur@@ se@@ ments had not been reported in detail , then the judge asked .
the club did not have in detail for financial purposes , but it was important to have been the freedom of school , so the answer .
in 2011 an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the United Kingdom to the United Kingdom .
the def@@ endants were , declared the accused .
this security account remained in the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
based on this , the questions asked for a long time .
then he thought that he had believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happens to him , no man would knew anything of this money , the Prosecutor dropped into the room .
the compla@@ ined case had been informed of the functioning of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim inf@@ itu@@ ation . &quot;
why is compensation ? , Judge and State At@@ tor@@ ney know .
at this declared the first accused , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been created a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer is saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representatives ? &quot; he asked him .
in addition , the function , he never had a cent content relative , he counts for o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
he took invo@@ iced up to 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual work would have been much higher but added .
the def@@ endants were not able to demonstrate the necessary documents for the early years .
these are after an inspection test in which everything had been judged correctly , did not have been kept here , declared it .
the previous accused had also entered the o@@ dom@@ eter .
all the accommodation places are in cash , for this purpose he has to travel to the Bank to Hom@@ burg in his residence . he declared in his statement .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the hearing of witnesses .

it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
for the first time , we approach the situation in which a large central bank is leaving the zero point and start a process of normal@@ ization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars are being added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed may not ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .

lives in the Delta State University left un@@ avoid@@ able by a compensation
after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleagues later on his colleagues - wrote Sh@@ annon waited a note to saying that &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; sorry , &quot; he did not make it bad , &quot; announced officials on Tuesday .
police at G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , who called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and indeed he had shot on someone , and someone killed them .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency call centre , that the police officers have to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house but let none be disturbed , but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call of his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb had no explanation for its shots .
as a police informed the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten notes from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry to get it back .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the records , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , and eventually took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen r@@ ammed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Department of Ophthalmology , William La@@ FOR@@ ge , acknowledged nothing by a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ia &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb that he had believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said public authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence , &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular inter@@ relation . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ eous was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were about seven years married when a &quot; good man . &quot;
both were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but they remained familiar friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had one daughter , who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ bite is working online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les told that Pr@@ ent@@ ele had possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , who had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; you always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police who said I was sum@@ mon@@ ed at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the aim of the new strategic alignment is to profit a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year for cost and revenue , the airline sold the airline on Wednesday .
there is no support for the passenger business in the future with the airline .
for example , the cost airline Euro@@ wings must be developed as independent as possible .
then in future , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , will be responsible for the European city of Karl Ulrich Cher@@ em@@ akers .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w von Manchester United is not playing for months because of dou@@ ble@@ eds .
in the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the champion of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven is also a double fraction of its right B@@ one .
while this left the stamp of the left to weeping and break it for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , when the 20 @-@ year old sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V region .
he was treated for 9 minutes on the field and required oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg correc@@ tions and is in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester .
it is dre@@ ad@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays as fantastic and that &apos;s what happens .
he had a oxygen mask on the locker room in the locker room .
he wept .
I am not a doctor but if you have double correc@@ tions then the six months will last , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ et .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , brought not pun@@ ish@@ able the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed the way that the Italian refer@@ ee had wrong .
they can judge for yourself , when I say that a mo@@ at and a red card were due .
it was a much worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Sha@@ ws account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I get stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this situation in Manchester United , Manchester United has disp@@ at@@ ched the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V .
the European defence team has an extra inc@@ en@@ tive to recover an additional inc@@ en@@ tive by the European Championship in France by the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very worst case . &quot;
if a player leaves with this kind of injury , all will be very sad about this .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a leg break as well as Mexico with Van Ga@@ as the Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; it is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very worst case , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in a different direction , so as if he touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on hat@@ ch .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know , how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I feel so tired .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to hospital - after a s@@ oul@@ ders of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that will learn all their parents : if your child loves a book , it will not last long , until you know it almost completely .
unless you are or David Cameron .
when he asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child le@@ buch was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , creative , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my kids , because it seems to give an image or a message that we &apos;ve missed out so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly outlines the content of the book , instead a question of the movie Version of 2012 , adding the new characters and details to extend the fairly short text @-@ text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a good , the girl friend of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , has been ful@@ filling his wish to be a real tree , &quot; reads his dear name , Theodor Se@@ ve host@@ els , and who died in 1991 , but quite unknown .
like whether this was not yet susp@@ ect , the text by Cameron is repeatedly recognized as a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is on the web page of Th@@ need Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a product , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he gives way to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is going to become so little familiar like the local environment because of the c@@ ash@@ mere Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , car@@ ri@@ pen@@ er being , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper , The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row with a child .
one D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text may probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons suff@@ ers .
Super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the dis@@ soci@@ ation from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has selected the cad@@ re that has been selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my card .
I would not close a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ke Site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing installation , and the community mind is strong ; they will not wear spe@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful attitude .
featuring the ball , Mo@@ een develops as spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid as a spin @-@ punch , even if it represents an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack .
this news says : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ j@@ un and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is natural for me as its boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
during its seven test , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ rels are al@@ igned to results .
there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told these - players their own best selection .
long ago , he extended the run of Ly@@ t , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hop@@ efully get out more directions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance will be taken .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he didn &apos;t put such good performance , and it doesn &apos;t be surprised ; it is a team of men .
the question , how much time a test is perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ed to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ p@@ on got the chance to play home and moving forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift up was that England first sat in the Caribbean Sea - when Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in and he is a bu@@ zz@@ mann , which I guess high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we have seen at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when it scored enough against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he has to have at least the same opportunities as they received before , but this depends of course a team of staff in the United Arab Emirates .
in addition to Cook &apos;s idea , the idea to show a extra @-@ spin bowl and four cr@@ icks can be given up to cook , and I did not show anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz@@ mann can not strike there , and this left @-@ hand has already shown that he is a Devil &apos;s cast 1 Cri@@ cket Player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no great number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests with the first drop before he appeared as Op@@ ens in 2001 .
he made three hundred p@@ eg@@ s of age and looked not down .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is coming into the Ka@@ er@@ as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and with him he was very impressed with him as a young man .
people may see its statistics on an average of 31 on the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning that hit her hands and the train@@ ers have opted for a youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England gave some wise additions of the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , became a coun@@ sel@@ or coup in Sri Lanka .
he is one of the ni@@ c@@ est fellow of the game , which is a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and takes energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela has inten@@ tions , from whom we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can fresh in the locker room refresh even if the news stand in harmony with the earlier language .
kid &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , or indicated a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with that .
some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ rider does not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that , as in the players , they depend on the results .
such decisions are not stri@@ cken in heart .

in fact , mil@@ i@@ ke was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir even when he was promoted to Cam@@ er@@ ons back vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e , because Bla@@ ir had placed the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his back door .

experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) signed the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the information of Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he released the &quot; basic report &quot; in the last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the handling of the data and presented to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily limited basis , &quot; based on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion .
two further researchers are writing BM@@ J and we asked whether the statement &quot; claim &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Pra@@ lich@@ an Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public is expecting the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the references and modeling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single meeting of 12 persons who have been called to develop a model for multiple @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to contribute their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine related products . the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received the British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) before being an independent study .
he also subscri@@ bed the references of BA@@ T , Public Health in a sustainability report , as she said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting gave orders to receive an E @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing that he have received and have received Philip Morris International as reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not given , but also includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session took part also the tobacco line of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however no such connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; There is no evidence so far that &quot; so far , there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers only serve . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J was respon@@ sive to the claims of BM@@ J .
as he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second mis@@ si@@ r@@ ong dies at his di@@ ke .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are in comparison with it , but that we still have to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to regard to the public about what is the proof and what is not , especially when there are much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die every year on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health system two billion pounds per year .
through the clear advantages of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk but only a fraction of the damage caused by the smoking will be presented , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give commission by the En@@ ders , says a former boss of Channel 4
the former director of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop running programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Rival &quot; would give up their right hand &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio service will only be used to do the manner of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster .
it critic@@ ised the BBC that they are publicly supported by a public audience , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , in the hard gra@@ v@@ able time window against the most popular shows of their Rival and of transmitters such as BB@@ C4 .
when the BBC Music Director General , Tony Hall , announced that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson showed that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs reports that BBC can be shown in order , as well as broadcast@@ ed clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; related to the BBC &apos;s Ober@@ haus communications Committee in its research on the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea , the production should work at least on programs , the other do not do or put into commission .
you will send the Voice to a first @-@ class window as they want to achieve a far @-@ width support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense of course .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive set programs is financed , which could be subsidi@@ zed without subsidi@@ zation .
the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly dum@@ b both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I personally try to see how this is going to be a public tv .
I do not believe that the BBC would like to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC School is based on the hunt for &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will be doing what was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , who took place in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders were to sell .
Johnson reported that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should not measure , but they can not carry out their duties , but they can argue that if they created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure missions for 4 billion pounds , &quot; now , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs , which nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
for the radio service Johnson I said : &quot; I encourage you to find a more inten@@ tional system in terms of conditions , which can obtain the best value in it .
of course , you think all , think that one receives a great value for £ 150 each year , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who had told it before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian @-@ Mission , &quot; to make it easy to keep and maintain . &quot;
he said just short of the BBC &apos;s production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0,1 % in the radio - and it should also change an example in &quot; informed , clari@@ fy and chat . &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are scheduled on TV and will go down with the commercial @-@ commercial Alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ e@@ Gen@@ etics Can be brain bra@@ ins controlled by sound waves
the video shows how emat@@ emat@@ odes are changing in the directions , in which it oscill@@ ating with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gen@@ etically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by either waves of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes develop , in the direction of which they are sc@@ aling with sound impul@@ ses that are used for the human hearing to be heard .
the pul@@ ses works through the switch of m@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gen@@ etically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
another one on this topic : researchers read and write deer activity with light
the researchers , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process called Son@@ e@@ Gen@@ etics , in which ultr@@ as@@ ound still can be used to activate a range of brain tissue , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
no@@ bar@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain disorder , an inv@@ a@@ sive process that gives an electrical conductivity into the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
f@@ aden@@ expression did not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they were doing it when it was surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asonic waves , who enter into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ as@@ ound work on structures that are expressed by TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion@@ als and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the cubes .
these waves of sound are the opening of these I@@ onic channels and enable the cells to whom they are tied to , such a message Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , wor@@ ms changed the wor@@ ms that some of their l@@ yp@@ ho@@ ons hold TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion@@ als .
if he use ultr@@ as@@ ound on the changed cre@@ atures , the sound waves are blown through the micro@@ waves and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they switch the modified mot@@ ions .
the method has some simil@@ ar@@ ities to the Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that scientists enable , neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of the light and power off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that there might be some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , that need to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , the low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic scan tissue can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with sexual therapy and a therapeutic cause it is possible to temporarily depri@@ ved the human neur@@ ons temporarily to make for the ultr@@ as@@ ound examination for certain neuro@@ logical prevention , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added it .

8 Golden Rules for Life in Student Residence
11 years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but I do not remember the cl@@ amped sm@@ iling of those who I touched - and on the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules .
the adv@@ ent in student residence halls reaches from light @-@ writing to an absolute fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is del@@ ight@@ forward to w@@ att@@ ing : people tell whence you come where and where you have taken Sabbath year , where you can &apos;t love many days , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a He@@ fe@@ ather @-@ ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make question and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps to find out those people who don &apos;t like to speak with whom you would not speak , even when your lashes were burned in fire , and these extingu@@ ishers .
let people let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and her under@@ wear .
related to : don &apos;t mind that to start the university with a relation
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be one refuge , but many halls of residence form a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ space @-@ bo@@ um@@ b culture , which can be friendly and soci@@ ally can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away to get the energy back , which I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a recru@@ itment of sen@@ speed is exhau@@ sted - and send him a SMS instead against it .
A@@ pro@@ pos Bo@@ unce : do it .
a guy in my student residence hall had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
getting up for friendship with B@@ aking .
since you begin the university on the peak of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , there &apos;s the clo@@ cking of the doors of people to sit with a plate of brow@@ nies , less stran@@ gely as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s . so , now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade tre@@ ats offer is a good way to close friends .
the roomm@@ ates are obliged to keep himself , and at the end perhaps their face will be associated with a delicious surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make them sleeping , when you kno@@ cked off .
food to steal , is a free crime in student residence halls .
naturally , the ho@@ wit@@ ches of h@@ ens is a theft , but does it take about a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check it with the owner owner .
the odds are fine that they can say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , then it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to use that more balanced as my fellow worker , who added to her milk , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in jail .
you should not make noise , the people withdraw from sleep or from work .
it is not just about the decent man to be a decent man , but that you are on the tru@@ est sense of the don@@ ate to people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked their neighbors , whether it makes them something quiet , Dr@@ um &amp; bass is getting much qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted to him with the pur@@ er of music .
and finally , when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbors still two hours , before she left their own music , shut their door and ended up at their three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future partner would happen to be able to enter the same residence hall ?
in the way , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al if you have a co @-@ resident for your future wife partnership , to separate themselves , and you &apos;ll have to see them every day , and perhaps you &apos;ll see how they bring together all common friends ?
of course the heart walks by his own way - but when a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future sexual partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ card a bit of mind .
at an exciting moment in which you notice that someone ordered his key in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing , than it seems .
one good swe@@ ep is funny , but it only lasts moments until it becomes the B@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
learn through ver@@ ge a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but never regre@@ t someone &apos;s rooms with your to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which will then put you onto the freezer - but push your holding on the blan@@ ket no more than twice as twice .
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , All@@ tra@@ ders , Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ dien@@ ne
the real estate business of Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is based in the Central @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ild@@ sk@@ ie cottage for people who did not have a lot of money .
thus , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees must require living space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ om@@ ol@@ aters . &quot;
&quot; I show how well it is possible to build and well today , &quot; says the 44 year old in the interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur &quot; Markus G@@ ild@@ ner thinks about how much cheaper living space can be created : it builds for refugees &apos; houses in a project .
Mr G@@ ild@@ a , many refugees will push for the home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : a considerable reduction in containers or gy@@ ms have no sustainability .
cause the people stay in a big part here .
in the face of the refugee current we also need sufficient space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terminal block is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ a : a town@@ house needs room for the f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if you discover the people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for every four applicants .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees are mass@@ ac@@ red , there is peace again , I go back again .
then the houses can be re@@ model@@ ed according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ a : the price for 160 square meters of living space is 184 000 Euro , with no property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is reasonable .
do the building regulations have their plans so complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ a : legally I have passed my project correctly .
it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ cl@@ onal im@@ ilt of special construction and the slot regulations .
cre@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it still under@@ stands who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , at least three pitches .
only in the cities is there a lot of space .
and Refu@@ ge@@ es and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have the people react to their bra@@ k@@ ward project ?
G@@ ild@@ a : they asked what was accused of having a luxury trip for asylum seek@@ ers .
that is definitely not correct .
but do not tigh@@ ten the best in terms for countless apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ a : it &apos;s true : in the past five years we had a building boom in Germany , but they were build luxury apartments that cannot afford more .
my project has the message , also the normal people needed living space .
not only refugees , but also the only pul@@ ses whom alone are alone .
I show how to do it today and work well today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by allowing you to enter the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , gives you the phone to download and then install it .
some are in@@ correct after the installation , since they received an error message , which shows that the &quot; software update was missing . &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait for either waiting until the look@@ out is returned or trying to update to iTunes .
the phone calls you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it un@@ likely to do this by the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to er@@ ase these apps , if you need to install a special tool when the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a loader unit , so that the battery is charged .
if the charge is too low , Apple is not allowing that the update will be continued , as the phone may be turned on half way and possibly result in a termination of the update .

in addition to consult@@ ations you can also participate in courses .
the social Foundation is coming down from the hill to the inner city .
exactly said to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new mer@@ ging office was opened there recently .
besides , directly next to the shopping market , we immediately receive senior citizens and advice for questions , such as nurs@@ ing care insurance , and care for the care and care of the care insurance .
we have been exhibiting in our out@@ patient care service since years so that often by often care are left alone .
there are also many questions .
&quot; even often so many services are not util@@ ised , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new manager in J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is responsible as the president &apos;s Head of Service as well as the &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; service center as well as the ambul@@ ance service .
in addition to the Advisory Board , the new Qu@@ ant Office offers health prevention , health care and wellness .
that was taken by the Sal@@ udi@@ s with the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers as a prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherap@@ eutic drug .
the offers of the veter@@ an centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement one another in an ideal manner .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevent@@ ative care and rehabilitation .
&quot; the retirement centre for care and maintenance , &quot; says Heike Rie@@ del , the Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of the new Qu@@ ant office in the city centre will see both in the demo@@ graphic change .
because this is a good de@@ central infrastructure in the various town parts of Bamberg in the future .
Moreover , the painting of the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) , at the inauguration party , dedic@@ ates the association to work even before the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite for a regular convi@@ vial of presence . &quot;
thus the social Foundation allows a great contribution that senior citizens may live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ ery Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy are we are going to continue in practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the teachings of the Lord , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients are born in the practice of Fel@@ ep@@ ausen at Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter , in which the nor@@ theastern practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practition@@ er .
a positive side effect of practical guide through Frank Müller : the chem@@ ist remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints in A@@ sen@@ dorf .

&quot; &quot; &quot; who is visiting gar@@ bage and continues to look especially in trusted faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf a era , after all , the medical profession had pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls the cr@@ um@@ ten@@ se of the rh@@ einf@@ o .
a little lam@@ entation , they feel after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , many patients are often seen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ St@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is complem@@ entary : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; I have always pressed private work before my garden space , but now this could become otherwise . &quot;
Moreover , the couple has two grand@@ children and gladly travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for Minister Johanna B@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border would stay upright in parallel .
as before it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for asylum is able to do so , &quot; of course . &quot;
the feeding and safety of people are standing in the fore@@ ground .
however , it &apos;s clear , however , that there are significant signals , &quot; said the other .
people must know that we do not accept the bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is coming &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would like to continue travelling together in Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
nevertheless , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach , did not see it .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intense .
however , the border with Croatia is checked for an outside limit of the Schengen area .
like the Minister , Mr. Sloven@@ e is not w@@ anting to inter@@ lock his borders for refugees .
&quot; every EU member needs to fill his obligations , otherwise the system will not work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel to eastern Croatian border between the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to express their registration .
but the Croatian police attacked her in the near Ma@@ e@@ fields .
according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles will ever meet new refugees .
it is predominantly around Libya and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
life expectation and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days its country with around 4000 refugees said Minister for Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo was based on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian police ( Mac@@ ed@@ onian police ) who had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
but the government in Belgrade suffered them it was to in@@ corporate certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor we want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , in any event the first bus with around 50 refugees came to be met in the Serbian border of S@@ id , during the day of the day , further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been travelling the whole night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us so promised us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this might happen , in fact , that there might be a predicted shifting of the present Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the control systems &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that in the event of a strong growth of refugees for refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible shooting situations .
however , as he did not call it , he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the control . &quot;
it runs str@@ ingent controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of the EU partner since 2007 , since then the country has consistently developed a good report indicating the level of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees continue to have participated in the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cro@@ s@@ sings Hor@@ g@@ os and ov@@ i Bre@@ g still remain blocked .
however , if the remaining refugees wish to continue travelling to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister for the Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic tried to calm a local hearing in Hor@@ g@@ os : he is on the debates about Alter@@ nati@@ v@@ ests of refugees , after the Hungarian border ended , for wasted .
there is currently not a very high number of refugees .
it is not possible to say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
helper against migrants to - hazardous and ageing
in fact , in addition , private Hungarian refugee aid has started to distribute the refugees to negoti@@ ating maps , where alternative routes passed by Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ profitable : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s war still not yet clear min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

in this way , the investigations were recovered to a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside of our country limits are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is life , therefore we have passed through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the mission of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Order is ensured by the pass@@ ers as well as talks and convers@@ ations available as volunteers .

therefore , this public inc@@ ep@@ tive action is good for the 20 year old .
not everyone can communicate to the sheets , it is under@@ stand@@ able , in fact it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still adher@@ ed to as with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , just as the Hosp@@ ital@@ ization Movement in the past few years has contributed to the people that people open .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Net mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ utenant @-@ gig@@ ant lowered his profit perspective to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight service and higher costs in freight transport .
the company also said they plans to use about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex reported that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share was about 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claims to earn a prize of 10.3 $ and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expect to expect at a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller observation continued , despite the price increases , which will apply by 4.9 percent , and will be effective on January 4 , and despite the higher supplements for land transfer of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it is expecting to expect the result from the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher income , and to increase its growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will benefit from the negative income as expected , especially in manufacturing and global trade , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival to UPS , who is planning to hire 9@@ 0.000 and 9@@ 5,000 people working in the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of the US Investment Research agencies , and analysis analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six von Z@@ acks provide an expected 12,@@ 23 billion US $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex reported a decline in international priorities for the world to stag@@ n@@ ate with revenue in its unit shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping centre has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher operating costs in the freight business .
at the Pre@@ market @-@ trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amounts by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
this Tuesday , it included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th .
on their most expected conference in the year , the Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spent two days per week around a 27 @-@ minute transit Ma@@ ha@@ g@@ oni @-@ Table to decide whether it is time for the first time in nearly a decade to take the lead .
threat@@ en@@ tive of them at one end of the dedicated , two @-@ story sitting area is located a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ in and her colleagues are to set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order of Congress : to maxim@@ ize US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders recognized that there is a un@@ sh@@ it third party : financial stability .
and this third term target could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be ready for an exceptional short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that they grow strong , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il could make a mere F@@ ed Representative to increase this vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest to Bundes@@ an@@ bonds - and be it only by one @-@ fourth percentage point .
&quot; in particular , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing . &quot; at the moment , Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief of Staff at the Mak@@ ler@@ company H@@ ur Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty of the global market has enough justice to keep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures on the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who have been questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have been surveyed before by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed , with a key Indi@@ cator which indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates an decrease of the stock market , if the F@@ ed is increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists move the impact by dis@@ bur@@ sting them , they promise that another increase is far away .
at Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score would be 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy holds the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Management Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
in case they do , it would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so they are not into pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts ar@@ gued that a higher interest rate would stay the financial markets because they would eliminate un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act to eliminate .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good way to raise the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of monetary conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ in had told the spr@@ ing@@ time in spring and early summer that , in spite of the compla@@ ins of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in value .
although the creation of employment places in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % over the last month , which has the lowest for more than seven years and close to levels that sees the F@@ ed as full @-@ time work .
pay@@ outs have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation remained constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed House said that the primary cause was to be exc@@ essive @-@ pra@@ ising at a significantly lower price .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it on account of the tension in the labor market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ .
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of the past month after China had given its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score was dropped by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would collapse the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow Jones achieved by almost 10 % below the beginning of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market in turbul@@ ent influence the complex calculations when you should increase the interest .
&quot; when the events did not occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks , she said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate , and a former employee of the U.S. emergency bank .
now he pre@@ diction that they will wait at least one month in order to get the effect better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
health of the global economy is not one of the main ones in the F@@ ed , thus shou@@ ldn &apos;t be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final result , the F@@ ed currency office became the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge over the past years .
the she@@ er warning of that time by the former director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 revealed that the F@@ ed could dist@@ inc@@ its its monetary expansion &quot; in the dec@@ als around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasing , it may be anticipated by the F@@ ed representatives so that they can not only monitor the developments in other major central banks , but also advised by other central banks and experts to get a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art as Science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , director of the global strategy for the financial management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey So@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements , which has not been associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
chi@@ pper , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de ad@@ mits to a interest rate hike , made choices for the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limit@@ ing effects on growth in the US , &quot; sp@@ agh@@ ett@@ led .
a year later , the F@@ ed @-@ representatives started this cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of the financial stability during a severe crisis such as market @-@ bla@@ dder in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the Committee on behalf of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not want to worry about the situation in which she feared because of a interest rate because the markets are thr@@ ott@@ led , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said pos@@ es , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it has been changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be ahead of time .

Brazil and the Brazilian Society of Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy st@@ akes
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy how important nutrition during the stand@@ still time . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted to stock , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all the nutrients you need to make a strong immune system .
due to its additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ pl@@ et@@ ical adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet significantly affects the genes of her babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ Hall of the Sports Hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ward approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be sh@@ opped for a solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ sto@@ der sports ground step forwards : in the recent common ground sessions , the newly developed building application was blessed when un@@ conventional discussions was blessed .
prior to this , the board of the valid &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion was determined by the valid planning regulations , amongst other things .
with the &quot; exception &quot; there was the permission for a special form of the roof structure .
the roof top should be built with a non @-@ air @-@ ventil@@ ated first and a roof top . &quot;
background of planning is the planned use of the umbrella area for solar energy systems : &quot; in this way we get a very big south @-@ roof , &quot; explained by Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger within the meeting .
the &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; once again involves the roof pitch prop@@ ens@@ ity for energy reasons - differently than in the planning regulations - just below 10 degrees Celsius .
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
therefore , &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary , because the planning regulations regarding the roof pitch does not allow an &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ sto@@ der &apos;s council is generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ ating from a rather restri@@ ctive behaviour .

hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ cos@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the centre and the majority of employees go from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with a way of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , which confirmed the settlement of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision about this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the trial next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans have to be implemented , all of the 50 employees will be employed at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Fischer and the continue @-@ surviving interior station after Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the staff , which cannot be offered with ong@@ au , should be offered a work@@ station in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the staff are informed of the plans .
she has triggered the change of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the sole director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now converted to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question who is supposed to follow as a follow@@ er , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game which has prepared himself to take over management , and to change their team to Sch@@ ong@@ au after 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au style this is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; classification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and an extension of the range in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; range , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
access to the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is entitled to lead both houses until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ oll , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ v@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
for 2018 it is planned that the county has been planned for 2018 , when the current reconstruction is completed at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim .
Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met : that the house , which is in possession of the Federal Council , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ bit@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say that there are several refle@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , there is a short term care of the Car@@ itas and a mental hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fischer has been taken over the location of the dis@@ location to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from workers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what has been a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has worked as an editor for over 30 years , did not have it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the position of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by clamping forces over the past decades , and sections were closed , for example the surgery and birth aid .

missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz victims of violent crimes
a crime da@@ w@@ ler has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year old girl of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the interro@@ gation , the 20 year old was killed , the yo@@ ung@@ sters were killed and their bodies dropped in the Canal in Rocken@@ hausen .
one of the most 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is one of its violent crimes .
the dead body of the young woman was found at Tu@@ eb@@ lau@@ tern in Rocken@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as Public Prosecutor and Police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too heavy , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old drop was considered to this day to give information the investigation and the investigation into the fun@@ eral passing by the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old has been announced on Sunday morning , after having arrived at the evening after a visit to a autumn blo@@ b in Rocken@@ hausen near Heidelberg .
when the young woman was looking for the young woman , investigation began initially in personal bel@@ ies .
there was a crime happened to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old if it was in the circle of friends and expertise of the Ver@@ mi@@ sts .
the suspected perpet@@ rator introduced the police to a canal in Rocken@@ hausen , where the dead was found .
according to the officials , the officials transferred to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have put the dead into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old would be presi@@ ded over at the harbour of the passengers , investig@@ ating the bur@@ sts of man@@ ure .
however , the decision has to investigate further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warned of housing in@@ let
the location on the German residential market is very ten@@ se .
and more and more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing situation is in front of a challenge .
the distribution strug@@ gles on the German residential market have long since begun .
more people push on a market with the upcoming refugees and people seeking people out of the EU , with many big cities already now over@@ load .
they compete with a pay @-@ income citizens with the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units would have to be constructed by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this result , a study commissioned by the commission of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , in Germany there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany .
thus 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
in accordance with the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live asylum seek@@ ers in a season .
many encounter the living market and lined up in long queu@@ es ahead of the apartment apartments .
however , according to statistics of the Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in rent in the last year .
the negative development of the living room , however , is not only in the rising of refugees .
the study also makes significant simpli@@ fications in housing policies of recent years .
Germany slow@@ down a residential area before it , which becomes bigger from year to year .
in the metropol@@ itan areas already lacking around 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , an author of the study .
many appe@@ als were therefore offered in large cities in large cities in the WG @-@ room .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly in the housing market no longer voluntarily in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the major cities the number of square meters per capita has fallen in the first time .
in order to overcome the problem , the alliance &quot; Social residential building &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
then , new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost the social housing situation again .
thus , the property tax will not be wai@@ ved , and the basic taxes for sponsored dwellings shall be suspended .
in addition , the Alliance needs ideal pre@@ am@@ ort@@ isation options needed .
the funding programme for refugee reservations of the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W is already well connected to cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch was launched on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros .
this could even be rounded up the project .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are looking for a corridor
it is almost no one pass after Hungary , as some refugees chose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces the entry of Zagreb in order to grant a travel across Slovenia into the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous . however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country Slovenia via the facility of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian internal Minister , and if it is necessary we will take a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister for Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen zone already .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the prim@@ eval of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people had come over the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian Television station RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for Refu@@ ge@@ es on the eve of the day .
new law that came into force on the same day make proper procedures for asylum in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister , Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; You can travel through , and we &apos;re preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but there are people who wanted not to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border of Serbia and Croatia .
most of our media reports reported to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
guests came to the Serbian border as well as tax@@ is in the Serbian border of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they were trying to reach on foot over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees did not blow at the border .
for this , it shel@@ ters other haz@@ ards : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s .
min@@ d@@ ans will now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , hardly any refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police had lit up 366 men .
just before Tor@@ nado in Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws led the conqu@@ ering and damage to the mar@@ g@@ a@@ us as an off@@ ense .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged this only 35 criminal proceedings were launched .
the convicted sentences of pen@@ alties of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration Authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers took place on Tuesday , including almost all - 93 - in the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicant be 13 families with young children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had already stopped .
practically , however , no one has a view to get in Hungary .
in an un@@ official view@@ point , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the period flo@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ man &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to break up .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish which had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks .
sealing covers have been dismant@@ led , and one of the near @-@ mel@@ t@@ ages turned into the boundary .
no one wanted to utter this reconstruction .
Austria reach a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
in addition , the country has reinforced its border controls .
but according to government data , over 20,000 migrants lost their jobs in the country .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Brazil , smaller groups of refugees frequently came to foot .
Mayor of &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the conference when suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the Zel@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wer@@ n@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to do with the train to Pas@@ sau .
because Germany had previously adjusted the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday but because of the refugee &apos;s train station in Wer@@ n@@ stein , Stad@@ ler , who immediately got his help and assisted by two further hel@@ pers and their cars were bound over the border into the Middle East Pas@@ sau .
before we tast@@ ed the un@@ trusted visitors only once , with snack and drinks .
we have just said , we &apos;ll get them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grat@@ eful .
one man didn &apos;t take it to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we are very pleased , &quot; said Stad@@ ler .
the valid@@ ated train forms were reached on Sunday night in Wels by an ICE in a regional train towards Pas@@ sau , following the notice of driving by the rail traffic to Germany , but it was still visible on the border .
however , the regional train was sunk in front of the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein at the Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ bridge connected to Bavarian neighbours in the Sunday , a day before a two @-@ bridge portal - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent further documents to us , it is a logical result of an apparent policy :
rather than in the warehouse R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help the construction of structures to help human unity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has actively entered the attitude of the Hungarian government in the circles of the National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of these policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic approaches .
also the poultry users will notice that the &quot; hil@@ ly country , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
it will be a huge challenge , in view of the constant stream of individuals and the near Win@@ ners , to produce decent conditions for in@@ seek@@ ers .
and there will be even greater to them - peace , security and stability in Austria .
reviews on the search for 35,000 refuge
Konrad having filled all hands to do with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is there for his word , that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier strong Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banana to set qu@@ ads for thousands of thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the front @-@ recording center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen received them in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he spoke of a &quot; ky situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad meets a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ ant in the he@@ fty year .
to meet the number , over 15,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to be providing 15,000 of the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can get there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no hatred without bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held the way for talks with the tri@@ bal .
they had not backed up for him again , even in the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; Ferry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ela supports Konrad .
tomorrow will there be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who should be clari@@ fied in how the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also supports the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ping &quot; as we do . &quot;
the platform can offer private individuals un@@ complicated accommodation .
it is also hop@@ ed to have hotels that are empty in winter .
in yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier compla@@ ined about the standards for lodging as a &quot; extremely high &quot;
in case of emergency there cannot be a slight height of the counter @-@ holder or the size of the light , in case of not@@ ation .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency services would have to be applied . &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior in 2001 , he was prosec@@ uted by his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not telling the truth in his face .
access force is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause the republic no cost as they declared on .
they want to increase their head@@ count to three to four .
the branch @-@ search was still not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at step@@ han@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls a better division
not only an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the mo@@ oring of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary since the people concerned must be able to accommodate these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , in case of emergency , more sites will be checked to their dew .
criticism of the city &apos;s tax , about the division of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not shut off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ ad@@ inger ( VP ) has changed the further procedure in the refugee request on Monday .
ha@@ th@@ se@@ er assured me that the German borders are not ro@@ cked .
the further development of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , this process begins to set the respective limits .
starting with refugees from Germany there will be no more .
however , the gu@@ ardian would , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
at once , in the other member states , P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger once demanded more ampli@@ fied solidarity in the refugee request .
at once , Austria along its borders are controls , for P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger , a logical consequence , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the former of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Industry category is officially completed .
four of the six floors of office and production buildings are entered in the stock ex@@ ot@@ ot@@ ting IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT we are the wise heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ CEO Hannes Sc@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine that in the start@@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard , he could also invest and later also which will be equivalent .
from the outset , S &amp; T aims to cooperate with the new neighbours - a lot of which is surprising : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros was invested by S &amp; D in the site , 3.3 million euro came from te@@ ch@@ c@@ Enter to form a third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building will be leased by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as te@@ ch@@ c@@ Enter .
30 per cent of the 2700 square metres remained in the building already rented , for another 40 percent give it qu@@ eries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ is opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually J@@ utta has wanted to buy a dog for J@@ utta .
this project had to de@@ push the 49 year old Indian ruler of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the bar@@ bed market @-@ ar@@ ade : finally , it has actually achieved an increase in the shape of a new location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop compared to the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is now turning to women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euro .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
a total of several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have over@@ seen a long time , whether I will open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others , that also the for@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location , on which only their hand@@ bags are sold , were done .
&quot; we are the only ones in the greater region of Linz which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots .
your fashion interest has got the risk of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am doing most if something has been developed , and I can show new trends with useful prices .
why so some woman when looking like a beautiful hand@@ bag , isn &apos;t able to answer the wife &apos;s latest security .
maybe it is because a nice p@@ ouch has been upgraded to any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer crashed of Donald Tr@@ ump , came from a place whose residents are called An@@ sel@@ ors .
this property is also connecting to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he has been al@@ ien@@ ated to foreign enemy , journalists from R@@ ath in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential Presi@@ dential mandate on the election campaign strongly .
and cuts well .
that will also be registered in the pe@@ eled residential town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate markets are descended .
the New Yorker with the we@@ am@@ dr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant site , over -@@ eighty corners with it is related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the town of Simone Wen@@ del was able to see a film about tr@@ ump .
and what are the vil@@ lagers about his aim to become the most vital man in the world ?
&quot; I believe this kind will be exciting , but at its historic style , we were not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ y@@ camp has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ing@@ ing flies , in addition to Tr@@ ump , also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz has .
tr@@ ump , which is not known for shame , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in the city of K@@ all@@ .
in the heart of the hearts he did not bring it there .
although we do respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds to consider that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a large la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dentally powered the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - in German : the gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ ors , says it .
Tr@@ ump is thus coming from the village of the ep@@ onym .
the history of history began in 1885 , when her grandfather immig@@ rated and became a member for Gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ s in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate concerts were first property purchases in New York .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to home country , triggered by the Bavarian State on which the Pfalz were back .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because once he was cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ enni@@ al History and folk music , Roland Paul , was declared a film to be re@@ written .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the co @-@ evident statements of the desc@@ endant .
he was interro@@ gated again over Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a Wall in order to freeze illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ ari@@ zed , &quot; this is not so appealing , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a native Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; the O@@ ma was born , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement looks to the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always like three thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never cared for us . &quot;
the guest container in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions the fact that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to me on a visit something for the church gel , which occurred generally well .
&quot; I cannot imagine I Donald Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
it is better if he don &apos;t have a choice , because &quot; that has per@@ radi@@ cally radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had created the slogan in the days of his grandfather , the United States would have had such as he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a speaker ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; he says .
and : &quot; the grapes are due without the president of the ump . &quot;
Wend@@ ling film , who was inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump long , has seen 12 000 movie singer , even in the USA a@@ waiting the interest .
Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain rise &quot; is the top Bavarian community of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ ch@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden awarded the distinction for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain boo@@ ths &quot; villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding of the award .
a &quot; mountain &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as the protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , take over the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stefan@@ ovic und Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson is drawing to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als of Liber@@ als , but there has no major shifts on the reviews suitable for Today .
the breakfast exhibition of Nine was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m underwent a turn in the overthrow of Tony &apos;s message .
the Rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , set in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the country seemed to play no role for Australian television audience , as they scored 3@@ 7.000 spectators at the five major cities compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
Today , there was a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today , Today , 3@@ 18,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 90@@ ,000 of sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , sunrise will remain at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting what happened every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret to reveal ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ un@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have some un@@ know@@ ingly tail@@ or to those who bring to The Bachelor .
the woman who arrives in the Bachelor &apos;s bank@@ rupt@@ cy in The Bachelor &apos;s bank@@ rupt@@ cy was kept in great secret .
and none of the left @-@ left girl will certainly not exceed whether they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ un@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows per day before they checked out of three , they may acci@@ dentally specify a hint that will be the winner .
Sam Wood delivers his lips up to the final on Thursday &apos;s Thursday .
all three women have left out in lyri@@ cal way , why there &apos;s the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ itions , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who would like to receive the last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their answers could be more corrupt , who won the heart of the brook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewel@@ s Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ ap@@ ki quickly called his own - beside themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and when I continued ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies there I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were working throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ du@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be coupled together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ os@@ ki &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the proper chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay also believes that she and Sam Wood are suitable as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the school attendance of the street last week showed her clearly that Wood &quot; of One could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I became clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am settled there now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should pick , when she was , she was reven@@ ge .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be available on Sli@@ der on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his N@@ FL career .
Detroit showed big interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who send the end of in@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .

some co@@ aches had scanned in the rest of the game onto the Bank when he lost a comm@@ ot@@ ion in such a way as it did the turn @-@ out @-@ account for his first P@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but let this man trust in his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to put on a P@@ unt return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
tomato Please still show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of putting his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the left of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ esi@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ es , also in a press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ es was encouraged by special team @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ he@@ y , who advised him to take care of his pat@@ ched f@@ ang and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne was pat@@ ched at a P@@ unt , restored in the first playing district of Minnesota Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ es and its massive Australian ge@@ ographic base for his N@@ FL .
Hay@@ nes rested after F@@ um@@ ble the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM @-@ 10@@ 4.1 , that he could imagine a wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , it only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ es used the shar@@ pen@@ er with his original debut at the time in 2007 , when a pass was at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .

the free voters demand the number of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
party and parliamentary group Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn show in big wall@@ iser in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ er@@ ges , if there are no more than 1000 teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise , we will get se@@ wer@@ age in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Parliament of the Free voters lasted until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ia Commune .
actually the other main topics were intended .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free German voters .
&quot; in spite of course , the subject of asylum is applied to Cl@@ ause , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called on the set up of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it did during the Yugoslavia @-@ wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t go further , we must of the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free German voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lon@@ ged asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the Free voters as soon as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative buildings that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum rators , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the FW work critic@@ ise that several states were not system@@ atically asser@@ ted : &quot; we would need to uni@@ fy all the standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is p@@ per@@ ched , others not . &quot;
&quot; we must be handled . &quot;
however the country &apos;s policy is not to drop under the table in a major local town .
a long time favourite is mentioned on the agenda : the policy of education .
for the new school year , Department of Culture , Ludwig KO@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; middle class plus &quot; &quot; &quot; , with which an extension of g@@ ymnasi@@ um secondary school has been tested for three years - and in the result it will take nine years to the high school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; the subject of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; says the FW boss .
we call for freedom to high higher education , which would like this .
a free trip at the G9 wherever this is desired .

B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , head office officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside a police station where some of them cast stones and fire@@ bombs .
M@@ R D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have fired tear jer@@ as and then threw dust in the air before turning on rubber shells .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Rub@@ ber stories , of whom are known to kill them , but could typically be used as a less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the discussion was the last of weeks non @-@ violent protests in Nep@@ als , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid has announced that new provinces , which are formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal from the arus that war@@ fare a state .

working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature discussed this week via certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu , and officials believe that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

the project has stood in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros of project since months .
severe reactions of sea @-@ owners who came to the session met the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the Mer@@ cy owner and member of the management of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ age , who stands out all other buildings . &quot;
Moreover he fears like some other Project critic , that the traffic would be greatly appreciated by the proposed size of the plant , &quot; because all the bus had to be hired to get it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly on the good one hectare of the former restaurant is happening , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be a Sil@@ es@@ ian concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for easy obes@@ ity diab@@ etics can be beneficial in weight surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is yet too early to say that easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who received no surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ makers need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial of the new study in j@@ ama Sur@@ gery .
weight @-@ loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obes@@ ity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity sur@@ geri@@ es have proved themselves to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most of the trials were carried out being obes@@ e with a Body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , per measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI : 1 . us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and stomach @-@ det@@ our - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes cases that were overweight .
the average BMI of those , which are subjected to surgery , dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI kept on those who received non @-@ surgical treatment treatments approximately equal to 29 .
of the cases taking a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group the diabetes was fully dissolved just at one percent , and in part , only around two percent .
Moreover , the results were evaluated in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and of the bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol . &quot; in general , the authors found out better .
the researchers also greatly over@@ sees the patient @-@ level mirror of ha@@ em@@ og@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar during the time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and its colleagues .
the research team also represented average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger return trips in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and recorded a full loss of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery at five years of age , there are references from a study involving significant people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of Arizona University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people was subjected to an obes@@ ity surgery , approximately 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soo@@ thing for people who have a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of the study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , this is said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , have caused their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al of truly difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ Page
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East begins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist priest urged him to stop violence in the home of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten days of his visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put to the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the response of the western European countries of the Iranian depression was ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation isn &apos;t appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama , in Austria and Austria &apos;s efforts to transform the crisis , he stressed that it was a temporary client .
&quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
finally , we have to think about it , like manner of killing in their lands .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 , and provided that the violent activity of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ controlled events .
after September 11 , I had expressed my supplement on President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that his motives were good , but he set violence , and that caused an unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in the amount of infection conf@@ using by children in the past 4 years
the data centers in the United States have an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in number of children under the age of twelve , containing more alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ection , Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases has increased by hand @-@ infectious agents for children under 12 years , the tox@@ in conduc@@ ts , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency intake , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N said .
he said that some children are st@@ ect@@ ant to drink , while some of them are doing to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mutation in the social media .
watch videos on YouTube , such as teenagers were able to drink just because of a cheap experience .
youth have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to cure a harder drink .
younger children can be por@@ ted by attractive nozzles of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; she said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes , grapes and orange juice , which are attractive for children very attractive .
dry disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with small children , few sy@@ rup@@ es can lead to alcohol and po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ fts Centre at the University of Kansas , Kansas , cinema 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not need to be able to run Whisky , but people let that hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children are coming , there is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six year old girl who recently had four injection of straw@@ berry du@@ cks from the disinf@@ ect@@ ant post @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school was taken into a score for the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which had been drunk by the adult . Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey said she said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ie , a emergency doctor who handled it in the G@@ win@@ dy Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ jah her words and wasn &apos;t able to go to them when she arrived in the emergency intake .
but they watched over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl was fallen by alcohol and pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very wor@@ r@@ ying , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ mit &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft , non @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant and disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the child &apos;s range .
over alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with causes .

the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National Team of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there won &apos;t be any titles with T@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they have no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the T@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak of both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Town Fir@@ m Series , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly so - but we need to continue .
we really need to have the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
now , it is so important .

the explosion boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from summer @-@ window . &quot;
players who come in summer will have the high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes , more harm happens , by using unnecessary player to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom in the same period rose by $ 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the delivery quota of 5.9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s from 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland King David commented on the figures and stated : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements on the Scottish employment relationship with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment .

why I could be a execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a bit later , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a gallery hall in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the plaster .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked to I ti@@ cked .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
there is true that repor@@ ters may look at the US , and since often more applications are available as spaces , there will be an imp@@ ec@@ ere lottery to decide who is chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
if you are selected , it will change engine developing engine .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of closest friends , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often , as we speak .
the captivity authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to lead what I see .
I just have to try to remember all of the details .
a journalist in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my diso@@ be@@ et@@ ess .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you &apos;ll get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
they thought that she could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it is false what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not say to me what I have written , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can always remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to be an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement is in motion for the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , one repor@@ ter by the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the po@@ d@@ casts which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions , according to the assassination of Barry B. Tre@@ ese , would be guilty of a bene@@ fici@@ ent of the murder .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ter thinking about which you can apply .
what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man a wasted death .

un@@ mistak@@ able by a man of Perth , attacked the police , was un@@ successful when he was found in the silk and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer , the attempted to persu@@ ade him to go to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was set up in pel@@ vic incident on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape from them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he arose in the water , saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ al S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about it , its uniform cows , therefore he turned into a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cou@@ cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ cou@@ sins put his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards trying to explo@@ it him and threat@@ ening to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y on his st@@ ables in the past year , threatened to stop the race at once .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he tries to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself in difficult conditions , when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
it had been held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying @-@ age charges , and wanted not to see that it &quot; looks like intense @-@ related grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was before , nothing to say , and I have s@@ led long on it , but sometimes they are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that they continue .
sometimes one respon@@ ds , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home today , and sleep well tonight .
I would like to go about the head , and I would like to think that my owner will try for them .
if they start to think , I do not doing that , then I should not be a coach .
I need to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy won the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , decided that the integrity department had tried to eliminate his stable .
&quot; 18 months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said to a certain room with a man - when I will be asked to give him a employment in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy presented to Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they mistak@@ ably believe that I am a sc@@ ammers .
if that is the case , they should definitely take care of their n@@ oses , because they try to hold me in their attempt .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , updated current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still conscious today .
should I bring that the view that it is personally personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L are in a cow@@ ling and makes people responsible for train@@ ers outside of the train@@ ers , doing something in the industry ?
am I po@@ or@@ ly for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think there is that I am .
perhaps they have to take me my license and put me off , and I don &apos;t doubt that this , what I say I can think about it now .
but I am now at the point where the care is , and that makes me very sad .
this makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and ur@@ ge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit @-@ level of the train@@ ers have built a long @-@ lived cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw out his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known in its prepar@@ atory Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , awarded the race @-@ treatment instruction typically , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was introduced on the horse games , which was a violation of the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers broke er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously to the leg .
it could have happened yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , something like that .
it was this on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could get confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on racing day . an inquiry into this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one thing we need rules , but here we have to go far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy is going to fight for asser@@ ies because of propositions .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has criti@@ ques the tac@@ kling his player to his player &quot; Agenda &quot; Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ f@@ coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allows the Storm @-@ Player to fight with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday afternoon .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made an almost hidden note to the Storm Team , after his crew had reached the final victory at North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample book &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Queens@@ land would not be &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the T@@ ack@@ er@@ g of his team , saying that they are hardly focused on her &quot; contact &quot; during the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criti@@ que of two leading coach in his crew , informed him , because it means they had about to be turned from the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson , over Ring@@ claim , said she was defeated in 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real centre and that has been the tr@@ end@@ able for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team . he is therefore probably not to be used to lose , so it was a bit a shock to him .
it is strange , as it always happens in the season .
Bell@@ amy , Benn@@ ett has attacked your own idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and rec@@ alled that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons put in the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; red k@@ ili@@ y &quot; football .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he has taken his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; she says Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George became a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a partition .
but now he has a team that can play and that we as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like these .
I construct a reli@@ ance on this , because they say these things , because they are a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us than it was the big games .
Bell@@ amy also proved that the Storm The Storm going into Roo@@ ster an increased result than the game Bron@@ co to C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos &apos; was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points are ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet them in one phase .
the Storm team went free at this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from next utility tomorrow .
United States : 200,000 $ deposit con@@ du@@ le@@ - according to drug policy
a man , who may have had a life @-@ long torment , threat@@ ening to enter the property of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine that had sn@@ apped at Queens@@ land , was released against a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of five men who were arrested the last month after the Federal Police based 100 k@@ gs from the drug on Sh@@ anu@@ at@@ u , and presented in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he was indicted for his co @-@ def@@ endants in J@@ ach@@ era launched in the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite some potentially life @-@ life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , there is no evidence that he was trying to have the whole amount and that in the café had been a harm@@ less reason .
the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was wor@@ ried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
it has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
case of this case , he weighed the police over his position .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to get his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the en@@ hand@@ ing statements of both the people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200.000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the alone will not be sufficient to stop him , not to appear , he warned them .
mac@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released for security , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serb passport at the police , and stays at the starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

DS 4 : not completely new but completely new is the compact DS 4 compact model which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble bri@@ ers cut out of everything on the front panel : a radiator grill was renovated and the modified head@@ lamps with LED technology was fitted here .
the interior has been moderni@@ zed mainly to the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , reducing the number of buttons by a touch @-@ screen and is the first Apple Play @-@ Play is integrated .
at the IAA in the compact class , a series of over@@ works and new variants were added , like the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human in@@ defin@@ ite .
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered a former prisoner to the right of Justice , which was held for months in a small cell .
owing to the violation of its human rights , the in@@ dem@@ on was generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
people also may hope that they may hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confin@@ ed rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
a former det@@ ain@@ ee with its constitu@@ ency held in Karlsruhe has been successful : he was accommodated within the prison quarters of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a sol@@ itary cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
afterwards , the man , who , according to the information of his wal@@ low , was placed again on the un@@ locked hand , placed in a greater cell .
his official detention system against the country of Berlin was cancelled due to the un@@ worthy conditions of life .
but the Constitutional Court over@@ taken the judgment of the chamber of chamber in Berlin and , in case of renewed examination .
they were seeing the human rights of the man .
Chamber C@@ ause finally decides on the amount of the compensation
also , if applicable reasons only a few days of detention to the compensation of only a few days were due to the compensation , it was issued .
otherwise , &quot; a shift of legal protection of personality is to be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Chamber has to sort out the amount of money to be reimbur@@ sed .
in the past , the Constitutional judges certainly increased the rights of prisoners of pen@@ alties .
thus , they spoke in April of a det@@ ain@@ ee damages because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , once again the multiple use of a cell without a separate toilet .
Moreover , on Wednesday , in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had a prisoner in a parallel coup in November 2009 .
the then K@@ lä@@ ger was opened for three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a fine cell which appears in the Karls@@ bad style .
the Berlin j@@ ails came into head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of success .
the prisoner will therefore always be included again until 23 hours to get the aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to stro@@ kes itself due to the mort@@ al situation .
under the information of the pyramid of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel will not be occupied due to lack of defect , 19 should be due in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge : the Federal Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the progn@@ oses of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Germany , according to the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to host one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I tell you again and again : we can do it , and we are able to do it . &quot;
what comes up in Germany , gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( valuation of the Federal Ministry of Transport ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ icide @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - for the next five years .
this is almost double the amount , as has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living room but above all for paid rental objects : 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments each year are dropped out of the rental price , and in order to apply these very inexpensive apartments as well .
Federal Minister for the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million euros to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ o Institute : 80 000 social flats have to be constructed each year and that would have to invest heavily in the amount of € 6.4 billion each year .
it is the scientists and the Federal Minister for investing in that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the surveyed work could be employed in Germany .
in Germany , the refugees in Germany did not engage system@@ atically after their qualification to help them critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the assessment of self @-@ definition , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of migrants , says mig@@ r@@ ation for@@ ger Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ issu@@ hardt , a political shift took place : banned from the ban of employment for refugees to recognition of work .
while it was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence permit that apply to asylum seek@@ ers .
in the company itself - even because of the half @-@ strength , it asser@@ ts itself the visibility it has to be enabled in order to enable refugees to improve access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing in German language skills .
so far , there are still no imp@@ ass@@ able offer for general and professional language courses .
studies show that work@@ places can be conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is to be closer to the view of the Royal Path from the Royal Path .
the Berlin school authorities found that only few wing@@ ed parents had their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated to be 10 to 15 percent said : &quot; for the root @-@ root buried , it is only once important to summar@@ ize the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya cos@@ m@@ osp@@ ic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita distributed in various languages .
if the needs of educ@@ ators get strong demand by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate trying to increase the capacity and increase the training capacities by some more professionals .
students without language skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes in the countries .
they are not always taught of fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
in these , there is no lack of words , respon@@ ds to suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of all refugees in Germany want to study .
basically , no federal country asylum seek@@ ers or wat@@ ul@@ ted the study - the only exception to Berlin , Interior Frank H@@ ad ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude to date .
in addition , refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a sojour@@ n or ins@@ ure receive no benefits after the asylum seek@@ er Act of higher if they begin studying .
the latter is not given a b@@ af@@ fine , as they do not fall under the circle of participation .
ge@@ ared refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled B@@ af@@ ö@@ g effect , from 1 January 2016 , the Span@@ i@@ ards will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap needs to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ k , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student Union .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will soon play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is a key element of their identity .
the state should suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely colle@@ c@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have seen the churches , and develop existing state @-@ churches established by a new state @-@ religions relationship .
this would also be the creation of a islam@@ ic welfare state who car@@ es about new@@ com@@ ers to meet the new@@ com@@ ers .
these rights include duties .
so the representatives of Islam have to unite and willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to grant him some control possibilities .
he also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness , cour@@ ageous against religious foundations .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern of the care , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany as well .
those who want to au@@ sp@@ un up such conflict in France &quot; immediately tried their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said he in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to surrender the Basic Law at Arabic .
integration will soon be a lot more than today a theme of all society .
in order to change the majority society , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - a non @-@ discrimination policy and a General Equality Act with a tight decade .
however , it is a very slow start , how the NSU @-@ band showed , in which police and government ignored the ra@@ cial motif .
same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups non @-@ white German are calling for a long time and to what international agreement like the Anti@@ r@@ ass@@ al attacks in Germany must become reality in the next years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general Germany is capable of supplying medical relief as far as to the expected refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we are able to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this money needs to flow into the system .
to avoid degra@@ ding vessels , Mont@@ gom@@ ery offers to all call the si@@ xes directly to the health care industry .
the achievements can be completed later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it &apos;s most frag@@ ment@@ ary , so many people are dealing with the limited range of services which see the asylum seek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , they make the physicians to abol@@ ish the language bar@@ riers .
however , in so far as the Berlin @-@ based healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de is pro@@ ving , migrants are worse than other patients than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices fees or interpre@@ ters would have to be paid .
many refugees too were helped by many refugees also in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a other diagnostic view .
under the refugee community , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the yo@@ ung@@ sters , there may go up HIV @-@ statement .
with the other cases of other disease , German doctors came from their training but clearly stated in Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite ri@@ mon@@ y or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to identify . &quot; and as for the anger of doctors , the refugees could even fall off in sight through the refugees .
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to pract@@ ise pract@@ ising , they must prove their qualification and apply the same preparations for once again .
at least half of all refugees in Germany is an psych@@ ologically ill due to the Federal p@@ sycho@@ therap@@ ies ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ mat@@ isation or less depression .
especially viol@@ ently , refugee kids , explained Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the University of Munich , shows that every fifth Syrian refugee family is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever breaks on a post@@ traum@@ atic braking reli@@ ance is suffering from a so @-@ called flas@@ hing back with breathing wants , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ cal and de@@ ath@@ ic .
further symptoms are sleep and ability problems , strong dist@@ ast@@ ness and emotional merchandise .
to prevent the symptoms become chronic , a early treatment is necessary , that Mun@@ z declared .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a p@@ sycho@@ therapy .
you may imagine psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers in the social charges an application for p@@ sycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months .
in addition to the social authorities , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness can not be trained if a therapy was necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ assessment , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe held a false speech in Parliament
M@@ R Mu@@ gabe , Africa oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he has remained un@@ evenly , but the video of the Falls is spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also im@@ min@@ ted by the alle@@ g@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous de@@ per@@ ating thre@@ ats , and warned them before to join Mr Mu@@ gabe and Mr Mu@@ gabe .
in the past month they had bled him and interrupted his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change ( Democratic Change @-@ Democratic Change ) of Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions @-@ politicians had received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they previously warned that Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ elung &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number which is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said journalist after a fork . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the states of Parliament , that the imm@@ unity of parliament ends in the parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard are expected to install 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the frame of restructuring and company @-@ saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split into two listed companies , thus split the computer and printer operating business of its rapid @-@ growing company hardware and its service operations .
the expected job creation leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars as from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable more competitive , sustainable cost structure to the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer , which is to lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than today &apos;s order today and we have a broad and deep@@ ens portfolio of shops that support businesses with transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a declaration of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &quot; s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard founded to manufacture electrical installations and their Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;

FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel M@@ eta telling that te@@ amm@@ ate is facing the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
W@@ enger empha@@ sized opposite Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation go according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to lose at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history its participation in the next summer is surely un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace upon this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ening , and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not of the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there is a bone , which healed not well .
it is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be from pure medical point of view , but as well as W@@ enger , there are the related danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return out in the middle of the season .
it also developed a pleasant design .
the trial of Prime In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league boards in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the first Premier League clubs in line with the most vulner@@ ability .
in close , the potential of a vi@@ cious circle has been accepted , but Arsenal believes that there is an improvement in the risk rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from a breach , you have a time period of time in which you need to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial force , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to overcome these .
I hope his body stabil@@ izes , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way that he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal won its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against din@@ gh@@ ham Zagreb in front of the Play against Chelsea on Saturday and toward Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces one rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not widely travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ rec@@ y and Art@@ eta can be stopped .
it can also start with K@@ ier@@ o Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d ( by Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to give to a small try break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal have clear favour@@ ites , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the game grounds with the greatest duty effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 players after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign has started in the past season .
the stadium was shaken by a earthquake , but on the Richter scale 3.2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ senal led the teaching of the past season with the Champions League Chap@@ es to Monaco and will continue to lead the club to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph with his management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded at ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy @-@ Show , which give us serious lessons over men @-@ friendly meals
the absence of similar statements in shows is obvious , especially in terms of action as the need for men to be opened , now even more dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , to sp@@ ate suicide in young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ long time .
in 2013 , it was the most important case of death in men aged 20 to 45 , and three times more likely to be more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against the Living Non @-@ Communist ( CA@@ LM campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question if men need to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart piece in the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 High @-@ School students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms did not@@ withstanding that if the suffering l@@ ent a sufficient amount of friends with &quot; healthy tuning , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends , the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that their friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media guided , with its emphasis on style , the response of response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to seem strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if it is in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists asser@@ ts the values , money , image , social status , all at expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which acts extensively on our spiritual health .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beautiful form of Friends , that this focus was put on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , who sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend .
hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent U@@ mar@@ flows , moments in the football stri@@ cken in cosy s@@ air@@ ings and the vis@@ it@@ ums from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case even if they often have to keep alive their feelings .
as a fellow worker , as co @-@ worker stated , it was told me that ... &quot; my co @-@ workers for people who feel de@@ pressed these anti @-@ bats and are actually clearly demonstrated to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come righ@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived to be perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term amb@@ ition mechanisms .
it definitely presents very clearly the little moments of men @-@ friendly .
so very my objective ou@@ ter@@ i status via the telephone to help people in moments of desp@@ air also may help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re looking for this weekend of comedy friendship , a celebration of the day is a completely redesigned setting , why do you not take your friends to drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you te@@ ats in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends is sent to a comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for friendship

with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A requires a strong start against the Swedish Masters , since they did not only die the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ CT , but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities before the gate . he later became in play against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he started his har@@ vester career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win our opponents to cause problems and relax , even if there are certain things that we must have been perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , even though I don &apos;t regre@@ t that we have not yet heard one or two other gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his violation of any of three changes to the Paris team that could hold on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was thrown out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man to bring PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and it became clear why when he ran into the last month of Manchester United in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ el &apos;s pass behind the Malmö Defense , he finished in the long corner of the multilingual network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would be a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off match to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field lo@@ oted a serious opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ ils P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they cause little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself existed up , with some false spe@@ eches and bad sli@@ ps , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was pat@@ ched on not less than five attempts in the first half , and then abandoned after the re @-@ launch .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was turned to as a shooting down from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ yer .
the second gate was soon after the hours mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth overall winner after Set@@ hi@@ zi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and just an excellent entrance of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to stop the final result , before the entry @-@ level E@@ ven@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gateway at the end .
the trainer from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later released that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which did not represent the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ess of Minnesota &apos;s Cup
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
after that , they played one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the Tig@@ ers around the last place in the American League Central .
the ti@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but played on Tuesday perfect against Minnesota &apos;s Day with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field , though .
the &apos; &apos;s swal@@ low a chance to climb up a chance within the capture of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only one evening was it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to gras@@ p more than a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all of the victories make fun , no matter how they come , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s .
tiger P@@ it@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon held its early offensive support , while Detroit scored three times in the first two interior , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) pla@@ ited 6 times on the 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; says Simon .
it is difficult to throw in the bull@@ se@@ pen all the game , and therefore I want to concentrate on the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit ash game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marinade on July 6 .
&quot; he was good che@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( shock training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ ring , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three rac@@ ers in the back meeting at the end of the seventh floor , the T@@ win had their best chance to come back into the game .
chief Fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double in the left line line .
ch@@ amp of Aaron H@@ icks came to a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie de punch press Miguel S@@ ano , who had the tri@@ bun@@ ks of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finish line in the second brought Ver@@ hagen to hold the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at Double Play .
it was the major League in the Major League , 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit , at the end of the ninth place there was an Insurance Del@@ ete , a R@@ B@@ I double faced around the compilation of the tiger &apos;s Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved a rise of 5 @-@ 4 .
nevertheless , the ro@@ g@@ bands pun@@ ch S@@ ano for three P@@ it@@ ches for his Fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rac@@ ings in the first two inn@@ ings against the ro@@ g@@ ory veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the injuries list , after he turned out more than a month because of a back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning , which I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I stopped and felt that I would create some pretty good po@@ it@@ ches because of the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first case they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first , ha@@ ush@@ es released a single , Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , allowing a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single right on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was eliminated from the game , but he was trying to get to the third place what the threat ended .
the ti@@ ers gave a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ win @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was not very well beaten , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was on a P@@ itch @-@ Count , recorded no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the Rel@@ i@@ ever re@@ ins A.@@ J.@@ A @-@ handed .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there was three hits with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ kers .

the Con@@ federation will jointly serve alongside the countries , Merkel called Merkel on the end evening after nearly four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel , the fore@@ stry , the people who need to compla@@ in , compla@@ in about it .

no diet fruit - man@@ g@@ os contain plenty of sugar
man@@ g@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy .
but he who wants to pay attention to its sl@@ ender line , more often is dis@@ gu@@ essed from them .

when you buy , man@@ g@@ os should not be too soft or firmly to smell .
the sh@@ all@@ ness alone does not say about how ripe the fruit is - so also green sand@@ g@@ os can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s Square
after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
on Wednesday , by the President of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been baptised , an un@@ known spot in the park on the Opp@@ o hill@@ side on the name of the German re@@ ator .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation .
the park is located right in the middle of Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the name was assigned by the community of the evangel@@ ical churches of Rome in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority , often only in secret .
in a symbolic manner , in a symbolic manner , the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed himself as a young August@@ in@@ ian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he emp@@ ath@@ ered the city back then as much @-@ coming into sin .
his negative impressions are threatened by the histor@@ ians in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle .
then Luther led his Th@@ eses against the shut@@ sh@@ an@@ del about the split of the Cape Church .
Hammer Artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the Crown ( gold @-@ plated ) of thorns is one of the main pieces that has painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not on the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared in magnificent pictures now .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motives likes to phrase his very personal interpre@@ tations in paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and creative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is not all in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective issues can be well covered .
for three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has hit a sub@@ jective and artistic selection of the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles , which dev@@ ote issues such as cross @-@ way , plagues , commandments , or kin@@ dre@@ ds .
in order to spont@@ ane@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been on the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages .
it has been interpreted by the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ selected Bible study and thus translated into current connections . &quot;
these lyrics are like a verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original translations of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thought about the respective situation .
the jewell@@ ery sold has gold letters .
the 75 year old allows for the 75 year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
it is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
this was finally the trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant powers of Herr@@ ing .
&quot; there the up@@ bringing ever took place with the reed stick &quot; that Ot@@ mar Alt remembers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to quit smoking in order to bear me also back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim was to revi@@ ve the art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of image worlds today is min@@ ted today by Rek@@ lame , and that is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is then displaced .
artists have a del@@ ights and del@@ ights , things to show .
pictures have always some mysterious and are not decorative .
in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the audience go into the pictures &quot; bu@@ ck@@ le them , they themselves will draw , discover , and see what power they have : &quot; the picture is its counter@@ ing . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost pi@@ voted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Museum in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover from Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art . &quot; I like how he ri@@ pens with his paintings .
I am not asked to capture the Bible completely , but also one of the most important topics .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on ey@@ ep@@ ath@@ es , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; it is about the pictures , texts explained below . &quot; this was a picture of a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en up his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler about both the ( biblical ) language of love than that of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ ir issues - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opening on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction Start for BM@@ X train
plans made , space found , companies commissioned , earth@@ ys for a circuit race : one year later was almost everything ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
the se@@ ws into politics and management were intended for fear , especially in the inhabitants that did not toler@@ ate the course .
so hill slo@@ ped up , new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
I will discuss the hom@@ olog@@ ation in October , that the former leader of the P@@ Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ bu@@ ck will now tell the child and a Youth Committee .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B exp@@ ands its commitment to refugees from 2003 to 2019 , while the Bundesliga permanently sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the deteri@@ or@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his help in the up@@ lifting of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned problems .
&quot; I &apos;ve been playing for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle that nothing happens , I have nothing to do with this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested in every single interest in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ G CEO Wolfgang K@@ her@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting ( German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ tionally denied the situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet there the Minister for Foreign Minister Mr@@ s Di@@ zo@@ rex@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the theme will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer could help and to wool .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must set politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League empha@@ sized therefore its refugee assessment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; beyond the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun series we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , at the br@@ ink of the UEFA EURO in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some of the Federal Government also support this program .
already on this weekend 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts have a clear sign when lying on the left tri@@ bun@@ nies instead of the larger Spon@@ sor@@ i@@ ary Council ( Hermes ) . we can help the &quot; Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that all they are to help , where and as they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport Chef Rud@@ i gl@@ utt@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Newspap@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we need to use soccer by Austri@@ ans , no , we must use our radi@@ al power , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have suffered so incredibly well , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
on Friday the EM quali@@ fier for Hungary on this Friday will invite women to take up a team of 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach was the support of refugees as &quot; a large community collection of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ensee had started own projects in their own projects , be great .
as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of great importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association is providing together with the DF@@ G selection and federal government awarded 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have called for the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported thick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Board of Economy loses a eye on accident
the Chairman of Defence &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , who was reported to have lost the left eye after a fall in early July .
if he had an accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , it had fallen into a water glass after midnight , which he wore during the left hand , the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , he was bo@@ gged out , and dra@@ gged out on the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ such pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can go on with his job .
&quot; beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers are at meeting and &quot; fully ob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to keep the industrial group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP because I worked in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I faced some time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president Has@@ such pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ ating from Germany to USA , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is working for Germany and the USA since the summer but he was no longer working in the German SAP headquarters in Val@@ dorf .
it is important to him to have such a personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : everyone can happen in such a thing .
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you are fallen . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B in Kras@@ no@@ dar : Peter remembers your Gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , in the first group of the &quot; Europa Casino , &quot; all hopes made a com@@ eback to the Europa League indeed .
the defender will be missing in the table @-@ Bundesliga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can not take him back . &quot; he said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen will be closed again , the Bv@@ B @-@ coach was open , &quot; we expect a return to his training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loading of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its eleven position on the Re@@ us position .
in this way he announced his shift to the door@@ keeper .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ feller moved to the place of regular b@@ art@@ works Roman Tur@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher assigned the world champion .
if Wei@@ gh@@ en is going to be in the future in all of the Europe League Games , Tu@@ ch@@ el would be open .
with high lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood he will take the second game .
the search statement made by Mit@@ er Re@@ us that the final one has to be the final event for the La@@ ender in the Europa League , will be able to announce the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for review : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to cra@@ ve the title . &quot;
rob@@ ot@@ au@@ tos : government wants to act an iter@@ iter@@ ate role for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be the transformation of the technological leader in future .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the German Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which sets other investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday at the edge of the automobile show IAA of a &quot; new mobile age &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and networked driving force will increase the safety of traffic and make it less steep , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the subject also with his counterpart in the G7 countries &quot; meeting the industry also with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport is empha@@ sized among other things , the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and an easy response to digital radio stations .
at the time of testing new technology , a test ride will be produced on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be applied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to in@@ spect the legal framework conditions and , if necessary , on the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany so in Germany , Germany wants to deplo@@ y itself on the international scale that the permitted maximum speed for hom@@ e@@ ased vehicles is lifted to 130 km / h .
Moreover , the Federal Government will also set up a change in the Vienna Convention to present only the people as driver .
in the automated driving , the car will take over the lead , the driver will more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process data in a matter of seconds .
by a study set out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads &quot; only to be expected in the year 2020 . &quot;
the value added value for driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study to approximately 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; the digital networking of producing tra@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD parliamentary institutions S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability for accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
yet , the Germans see self @-@ moving cars - much more French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the pre@@ defined survey by the For@@ sa Institute in the order of the testing facility DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the result that autonomous driving cars will be asser@@ ted that in the next ten years , 32 percent are likely to expect that 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 were by autonomous driving cars , and 33 percent in the US .
meanwhile , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave their own self @-@ employed vehicle .
a only seven percent would conc@@ eded according to a survey of the digital producer and to give control over all roads during the entire journey .
on the fre@@ eway , that can present some 15 percent of traffic in the flowing traffic , and 45 percent in traffic .
just every V@@ ed@@ ged would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title , also without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head said during the European apprenti@@ ces@@ hip in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was situated at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship exchange in China .

&quot; without Timo is the problem , we are now no longer a cle@@ arer favorite , &quot; decl@@ aring single man who Dimit@@ ri@@ j O@@ t@@ char@@ ov .

&quot; in those days , Timo became un@@ ste@@ er , and we have been European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ kings @-@ Fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels big for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a blend of quite big fashion shows and a fall @-@ in sin@@ king sin@@ us@@ el@@ eton : the designer Jean Paul Tur@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday at the Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins are made up of video proj@@ ections . it looks like a video projection .
they are offering the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as . out@@ fits for the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he burned men in co@@ cks .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am en@@ f@@ ant than the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hairs . &quot;
&quot; it used to be light , &quot; in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
referring to the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) that has been seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the H@@ yp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung des ( walk ) on September 18 , shows that the fashion has changed his at the beginning of an amazing attitude about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he was on the other hand , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you die , you arrive at the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it is about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ow@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s hard rock history , which has never been writing a career , without having completed training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it &apos;s a great chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete works of art , for which much effort has been made : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist has been hired .
14 tons of material have been car@@ ded according to the bat@@ on by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
shortly before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest , there was another special anchor in this : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of t@@ ed@@ dy t@@ ed@@ dy is among the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender @-@ try attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) , he attracted his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and clothing , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents could not have allowed him .
but the dis@@ card of fashion he had taught it later .
he st@@ ole fashion tenden@@ cies and looked at the designs of other designers , in which Mer@@ c@@ ine was told in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models listed .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to hold on the clothes .
jewel@@ s made of Gar@@ ris - Pl@@ au@@ ger tip as fashion niche
so@@ oner they went to the long loading machines in and around pl@@ unge since 100 meters .
the need@@ ful substances and tips were developed in great amount for customers , whom , for example , to blan@@ kets and she@@ er curtains .
today the program does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the mo@@ wers Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the flat , fashion has played a major role , was then ou@@ sted through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt tax@@ ies a few examples : head of jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional trails .
at all , the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , re@@ jects past the pro@@ li@@ stic potential , an increasing the production potential .
not liable for those in the textile sector in Germany is not on the market anymore .
with us they make up just half of all jobs .
Mr. W@@ ack@@ et Pl@@ auen is involved along with nine further companies Member of the Industry Association of Pl@@ au@@ r and Sti@@ cker .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the past 15 years about 80 percent of their sales were generated .
private trade transactions and trade in the wholesale outlets are almost no longer .
our products are hardly able to reach the customers on this road .
the mass shipping , today , is produced much cheaper in the Asian region , and is almost exclusively distributed via chains .
in addition , we vulner@@ able to Russia as well as to the US .
so sufficient reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the nitrogen oxide in Fal@@ ken@@ stein . &quot; since this year , we perform a seal of quality , which shows that we have been ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt modified : &quot; this is also based on the materials used . &quot;
graduate in U@@ te Schmidt , at the University of Applied Sciences in Z@@ wick@@ au University , the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of applied Arts - and is specialized on be@@ et and tips .
to establish the competition from the Asian region in some areas , you need to find high quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
a voltage field is created between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that are to be thought to be honest , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only varied in order to keep a customer base .

in a very elab@@ orate processes they lay the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors had been living in pl@@ ums and surroundings , and who would like to remember the memory .
in this view I see my jewelry as well as the top of the flat top .

XI are seeking to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wide out@@ ward , to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , in the Tuesday of a group commissioned with the de@@ fle@@ ction of the reform .
&quot; China should therefore deplo@@ y their efforts to improve foreign investments and know @-@ how , and improve the strategies for business ups , &quot; in an address at the 16th session of the central leadership group , for a comprehensive reform .
deliber@@ ations to promote and re@@ forms of re@@ forms will promote new vibration and vit@@ ality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , support of public companies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the residents .
a negative list is created according to the statement , the sectors and businesses that are not candidates for investment .
the system is tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since the market agre@@ es to provide a major role in the processing of resources , ensuring a right @-@ state company environment and designed the market .
the government will also s@@ lack information about the powers deleg@@ ated to the enterprises and ensuring that companies may decide how they lead their business .
the statement also said that China border regions will reveal fresh models of the border crossing of economic activity and new mechanisms to promote local growth .
in the framework of an offer , open @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will provide foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; for a long term , applying the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to perform their activities , and to put professional judges and prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys , also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting they were also attended by Prime Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as published in a statement published after the meeting .
EU intends to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , thereby prolon@@ gs the consumers with significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the F@@ ood@@ watch Consumer Centre , based on a corresponding working paper of the EU criti@@ cally criti@@ ci@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects were missing , resulting in full speed of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt it is supposed to bear the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain like about Hai@@ yan or Sch@@ wor@@ d@@ fish &quot; of one of two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury @-@ carbon .
