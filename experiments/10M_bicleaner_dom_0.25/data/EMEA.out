Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe clinical episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
both ill@@ nesses allow the solution to insert or use the melting tablets in patients where the si@@ p of tablets need trouble .
in patients who simultaneously detect other medicines that are used as ab@@ ili@@ fy , the dose of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably used as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ itter is used to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin administered a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , giving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the effectiveness of ab@@ ili@@ fy , which prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was studied in three studies over a year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared to two trials involving 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses that compared to an increased un@@ rest , compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy has been compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo which had been re @-@ occur to 160 patients who have been stabili@@ zed with ab@@ ili@@ fy in which the man@@ ian symptoms were stabili@@ zed .
the effectiveness of ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which had to increased un@@ rest , with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in symptoms of patients with a standard record for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also resulted in studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to insert it ( up ) .
in both studies with injection solution , the patients showed the ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms increased significantly as the patient who received a placebo .
for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder ab@@ ili@@ fy has decreased in four of five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy has also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo which had previously untreated patients with previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses must also be more effective than placebo the symptoms increased significantly and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ ale disorders ( ste@@ am@@ ity ) , bun@@ ch pain , bl@@ ur@@ b@@ ation ( const@@ ip@@ ation ) , ser@@ ene hyper@@ re@@ tion ( increased sp@@ lice production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , ru@@ in fluid , In@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and an@@ xiety .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes in which the man@@ ic episodes applied to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
Moreover , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with chronic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not suitable for over the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted authorization to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for placing the transportation of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of smooth @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ ion distur@@ b@@ ance and for the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar cells of patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ecting disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even with treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ icides in patients with bi@@ polar disorder associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emia diseases , con@@ dens@@ ation disorder ) , frag@@ mentation ( di@@ de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure glaucoma or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were reports of reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
when patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occur signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty , should be moved into consideration , to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if the patient signs of signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever , without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be depos@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should therefore be used with cr@@ amp cr@@ ashes in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are associated with cr@@ amp cr@@ ashes , with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted rov@@ ascular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ it@@ iner@@ ary or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic pharmaceutical ingredients including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic ingredients treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ its , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness , patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica when weight gain is known as adverse effects and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system is caution when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized medicines with side effects such as marine dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in the common application with highly effective In@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should not exceed potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
depending on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be applied to an even increase in Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to alert their doctor , when pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data base in humans and due to the in@@ productive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk of red@@ ness .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol reported a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ery , D@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ l ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo was placebo .
in another long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ tic therapy .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was among patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long period of long period , more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study showed the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo experienced significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increase in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , was observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
regarding the adverse events that occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and cr@@ amp fail@@ ures , un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was observed alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence .
there are no information about the effectiveness of a ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis with the treatment of an over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is un@@ likely that ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis of an over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma measurement .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption in the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ore and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ receptor .
with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ric emissions tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ si@@ ent reducing the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor co @-@ lig@@ or , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ ting .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week 52 in a semi @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of the response of patients receiving a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates , showed a significantly more stronger than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Group and 57 % among the placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tern controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed no superior effectiveness .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and an exhau@@ sting effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a remission compared to placebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , mainly for the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery .
based on in vitro studies , the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ de@@ formation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has been cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and close to 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , and showed no gender @-@ dependent effects in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the impact of the room on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ac@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull impacts on their met@@ abolic capacities .

tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of human subjects , therefore limited to clinical use only limited or no importance .
the effects covered a dos@@ si@@ or @-@ sensitive secondary pig@@ ments ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of human being ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of human rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ x@@ asis was found as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in accordance with repeated oral gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human gene , the concentrations of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol found no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed in rab@@ bits , which led to exposure of 3- and 11 times the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption in the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ tern controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to healthy volunteers was the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ x@@ asis was found as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in accordance with repeated oral gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed in rab@@ bits , which led to exposure of 3- and 11 times the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with chronic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be completed and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under det@@ achment of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given , depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medication to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to disposable .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ AL Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
depending on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the sed@@ ation bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo was placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long period of long period , more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study showed the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo experienced significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
in relation to CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was observed , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction was associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ y / behavi@@ ors compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS dur@@ Compon@@ ent scores in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in the analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population , but statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo .
in a week 52 in a semi @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of the response of patients receiving a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sion rates , showed a significantly more stronger than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - group ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tern controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which do not mean over 2 weeks , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , followed by a 74 week study in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol over a stabili@@ zation before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar backward , predominantly in the prevention of a return into the Man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time had to reach the maximum plasma jet at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ectors was clearly toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target organ with a systematic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies for the reproduction @-@ productive @-@ icity according to intraven@@ ous application , there were no security concerns after ir@@ relevant exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity a repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gens have no particular dangers to recogn@@ ise people .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of human subjects ; therefore they have limited to clinical use only limited or no importance .
the effects expressed a dos@@ si@@ or @-@ depen@@ dency of mac@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ments ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of human being ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of human rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( i.e. 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ x@@ asis was found as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in accordance with repeated oral gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed in rab@@ bits , which led to exposure of 3- and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously used for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mono@@ therap@@ eutical ) was compared with the medication used by a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the side effects ) .
all in all , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients were treated with treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el associated medicines .
if one considers only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there were no difference between the disease and progression in relation to the disease and survival .
however , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , referring to these indicators , Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el associated medicines .
it is also not to be applied in patients who have both silent or before the treatment of low neut@@ ph@@ ema grinding in the blood .
the Medic@@ inal Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was not included in patients who had the first treatment more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs , unlike other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines that should not be given to other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced the Company Ab@@ ra@@ ke Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted approval for placing on the market of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not displayed for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( Neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ema &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavier neu@@ ropath@@ y during the ra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in Sens@@ ory Neu@@ ropath@@ y Grade 3 the treatment is in@@ filtr@@ ated until a improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see paragraph 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and currently there is no sufficient data for recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for the in@@ correct and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ shap@@ ing formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately depos@@ ed and caused a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients , no later ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane therapy cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ema rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while a uniqu@@ eness associated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not proven in relation to the inde@@ x@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac fail@@ ures are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of patients receiving the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ed funds .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not to be used , except for the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is infinite .
women in child@@ bearing age should be used during and up to 1 month after treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , a reliable reference method .
male patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , during and up to six months after the treatment does not bear a child .
male patients should be advised from treatment over a sperm risk , since the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can work on the traffic light and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important events of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ si@@ bly ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , side effects are listed , associated with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therap@@ ies for each dose and indication of studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ at@@ de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood :

ru@@ hel@@ o@@ fication 1 The frequency of the exc@@ essive relation actions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no col@@ onic connection with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ ine substance that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ lets and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in vitro studies was proved that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is supported by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ or is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umen protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ re@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation within the range of the tumor .
the use of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ ax@@ el of 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without prescri@@ ption ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries .
14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived in an peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y degree 3 , evaluated .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
the Ex@@ press@@ ors ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ propri@@ etary distribution and / or female connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ac@@ tic characteristics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abl@@ ra@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ u@@ ble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Clear@@ ance was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent free P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories it is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metal levels ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average amount of 4 % of the total dose associated with less than 1 % of the metabolism amounts to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , over patients at the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , because only 3 patients of this age group included in pharmac@@ ok@@ ic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light green light over 8 hours .

the member states must ensure that the owner of approval for the placing on the market will be provided by the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ se@@ Cent@@ res and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the drug ( expert information ) , lab@@ eling and packing age . • With unique exempl@@ ary representation of the correct use of the product boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ am is similar to organic medicines that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference ring &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal bleeding problems , where associated with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ ag@@ eing must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own bl@@ az@@ ing fl@@ ake , Ab@@ se@@ am is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care officer , provided that they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ bells should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ ah@@ ites in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is made , and iron ore supplements should be given during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or that the body does not adequ@@ ately stim@@ ulate the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in will also use operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was transferred to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed became an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by cardi@@ oid problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected before being transferred either to Ab@@ se@@ am or continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ bells between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
in addition , the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of under the skin were spec@@ kled with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients treated at Ab@@ se@@ am were in the same degree as in those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / l .
the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ am is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ raine and tur@@ b@@ ulation .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa or one of other components .
demol@@ ition under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since other studies are required to ensure that by no allergic reactions are caused .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine was initiated as a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which represents Ab@@ se@@ am , will provide information on the medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients who should lie the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome and fol@@ lic@@ ities may vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ bells by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
on the basis of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ bells in patients can occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ bells target .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ bells , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ bells rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the durable hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ance value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored continuously , in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose that is necessary for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher power outlets as patients where initial an@@ emia may be less distinct ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher power outlets as patients where initial an@@ emia may be less distinct ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 mg / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 mg / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ bells , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored continuously , in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for checking the an@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ bells , at least 1 g / l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reag@@ ent count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 mg / kg should be retained for three times a week or 450 mg / kg once a week .

controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions is increased .
the hem@@ og@@ bells rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .

if the h@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical @-@ treated an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ bells value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction under involvement in the respective patients who should consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and correspon@@ d@@ ingly treated .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive therapy proph@@ yla@@ xis , as it should have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases particularly in case of underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded , that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting signal value of &gt; 13 g / dl could pass an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine was not proven for ep@@ et@@ ine that they significantly improve patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of the tumour cells .

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ am , it can occur within the norm range to a light @-@ dependent increase in the blood pl@@ ets , which de@@ forms to further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , Vitamin B@@ 12 or Fol@@ lowing man@@ gel should be taken into account and treated before the start of the therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of anti @-@ physical er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ ia after months to years of long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin expressed ) Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in .
if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will cause your therapy to break and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated at the best .
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated due to a an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death could be increased .
in an increased or offensive cali@@ bre , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ ap@@ amed into consideration , until the potassium values are in the standard range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney clean@@ se and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror cannot exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blo@@ od@@ ness with par@@ agra@@ phs in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for evaluation of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ am .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood colour ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your removal dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood sugar ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ical event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weighed from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you have a high risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ ar@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pul@@ mon@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ am seem like a growth factor for blood cells , which may influence the tumor negative in certain circumstances .
if you expect a major orthop@@ ae@@ dic operation , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood cells ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive abst@@ ain as an increased risk for blood sugar formation after surgery exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you use other medicines / apply or applied recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drug .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( a means of suppression of the immune system ) during your treatment with abst@@ ain , your doctor may apply certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) says on the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check and ensure the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and that your hem@@ og@@ bells value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are set well , you will receive regular doses between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice weekly , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular bl@@ utt@@ ings in order to review and ensure the treatment success , that your hem@@ og@@ bells value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia speaks on the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ bells value does not exceed a certain value , the treated doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if necessary it is necessary to reduce the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 mg / kg may be given at 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the surgery , and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , you can also learn if your doctor holds this for you , also learn how to spl@@ ash yourself under the skin .

if a sy@@ ringe from the refrigerator has been taken and the room temperature has to be reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and men .
it is applied in patients with high frac@@ tures ( bone tra@@ ps ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hat@@ ching as they have suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be applied before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms after the in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , handle @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
because the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had suffered a re@@ frac@@ ture for the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials in a total of 357 patients and compared for six months using ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
major inde@@ xes for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme called the bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis was reduced by 70 % ) over a period of three years .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under Placebo the risk of hil@@ ate rose by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ y , 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are frequent in@@ fusion with repeated in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other parts .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion process and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( ext@@ inction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for physicians to use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients where the effects of medication should be explained and insi@@ sted when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission announced the Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited , a permit for placing on the placing on the market of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ate the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgery of the bo@@ unc@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long remission of patients was observed in patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s gift ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently non @-@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ate , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ bit@@ or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function interference ( see paragraph 4.4 ) When patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended because a limited clinical experiences for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients seem similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre@@ existing mort@@ al an@@ a@@ emia is pre @-@ treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure a temporary , with sy@@ mptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , their maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s gift ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene . should be applied before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk for oste@@ och@@ on@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic range .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be based on the treatment plan of every patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced from Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported by pre @-@ hop@@ el@@ numbers was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 by 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the total frequency of pre@@ vent@@ ric@@ ular fibr@@ illation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney dysfunction , which is used as a decline of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were similar to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory studies , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were treated below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients were complem@@ entary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical freight rates and morph@@ ing studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely investigated , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported beyond local reactions to the in@@ fusion of jurisdiction , such as Roman , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had evidence for local infections , including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer extracts or other dental surgery .

Frac@@ hist@@ ology At 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic diseases were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ vers@@ cular bone volume in comparison to placebo in comparison to placebo .
bone mark@@ er mark@@ er The bone specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal propeller ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months compared to initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were measured as rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total th@@ read@@ ings and scar@@ ves for all periods .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % at the closing price .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study , 508 men were randomised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( survey CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once weekly dosing was covered by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to the percentage change of the l@@ um@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone ( middle serum mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decline of pain intensity and pain was observed after 6 months in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as responsibilities at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy only ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up period .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 of those with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 who treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , are maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous in@@ fu@@ sions from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ si@@ er@@ ous .
after that the plasma concentration rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no impact on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ mes is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because it is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or not a direct or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function cut down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min not require dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
because of heavy kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies on dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ) have the 6@@ fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) describes the conducted studies in order to reach recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • In particular , patients ( mono@@ therap@@ eutical medicine ) can be applied in ( particularly overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with other di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can not be adjusted with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ sweet@@ ener or insulin , the previous dose of sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff@@ s or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ rate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sul@@ ot@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff@@ s or insulin .
this means that the body @-@ owned insulin can be utili@@ zed better and the blood sugar level drops , which means that type 2 diabetes is better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ p , in addition they received either account or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) showed how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that the blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , compared with 0.14 % compared to 6 months compared to 0.14 % in patients who participated in the placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper bre@@ aths ( cold conditions ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity compared to matur@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used to treat patients ( allergic ) versus Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ia ( high level of mirror - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment in patients as an alternative to standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permit an approval from Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , circular , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin @-@ in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) .
for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) are at risk to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and eyel@@ ids being monitored if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ roph@@ ic@@ ular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard unit ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver values are as soon as possible , as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as imp@@ ul@@ atory nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , harmon@@ ic problems , ti@@ red@@ ness , app@@ et@@ ite and / or dark har@@ n are to check the liver values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the pre@@ dat@@ ors of the laboratory parameters should be directed by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ si@@ ent weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fat deposits and connected in some cases with liquid resistance .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ ac disease , a minor reduction in middle hem@@ og@@ bells ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ u@@ cle@@ i by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ bells by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ atology r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensors , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin has received the risk of a dos@@ si@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the launch of the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a reported with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men should be aware of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a while patients could report about dis@@ rup@@ tions of visual acuity ; an appropriate oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered into account .
in a summary analysis of adverse events , regarding bone breaks from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated frac@@ ture of the frac@@ ture was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative drug treatment .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or a pregnancy , the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interaction have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not practice relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , such as oral counter@@ zep@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ ting inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by the 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is primarily due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ an@@ emia in pregnancy and increased insulin @-@ resistant to the mother &apos;s disease and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( derived from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic effici@@ encies .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ accumulation convey@@ ors over three times the upper limit of the norm range right to as under Placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ye .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ roph@@ ic@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ an .
since its market launch , rarely via heart in@@ suff@@ iciency is reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired events on bone breaks from randomised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pir@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative groups .
over a period of 3.5 years current Pro@@ active study , freight rates were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears over an activation specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin level of liver , li@@ ds and sk@@ el@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ creen production in the liver and increases the peripheral gluten development in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de was continued over two years to investigate the time until leaving the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was randomised , despite three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase , was random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to take insulin ; a reduction of insulin @-@ dose associated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ ine tor@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , limited study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics at 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and slightly , however , significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol while under Met@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the in@@ timi@@ dated tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , both via a effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ ascular disease were randomised in groups which received from an existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy in addition to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to the oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on generally will be reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness in about the triple the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

according to the radioactive application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ s ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elim@@ ination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than healthy subjects in patients with reduced cardi@@ oid function , whereby the rates are similar to the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree on repeated oral volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ si@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is primarily due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ an@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistant to the matern@@ ity and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the fat growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) were induced ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in a animal model of the family @-@ familiar poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ e@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture of the frac@@ ture was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative drug treatment .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative study .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was used in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human infection .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used for patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic reactions ) to human@@ kind ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be selected to blood sugar ( the full list is available to the package ) .
the Committee on Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not exceed the risks of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S Commission for the In@@ tra@@ deshow of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect can be w@@ ished with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle has to be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels has improved considerably through a intensi@@ fied insulin @-@ therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia hazard sympt@@ om can be perceived and should therefore be advised .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phas@@ ic , long @-@ effective insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin @-@ dependent ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can result in a change of the dosage .
if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adaptation is necessary , it may be necessary for the first dosage , or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients who appeared hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal in human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or differently compared to their previous insulin .
before traveling through several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such travels allow insulin and meals to be taken or taken during meals at other times .
the doctor therefore must take into consideration possible inter@@ actions during the therapy and to in@@ quire its patients with others after other drugs .
4 As for hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia which occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ abe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fruit to@@ d in u@@ ter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ics can lead to consciousness and / or cr@@ amp cr@@ ashes , with temporary or lasting distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .

a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may however gradually develop : • Ligh@@ tweight hypo@@ glyc@@ emia may be treated through the oral supply of glucose and glucose levels .
di@@ abe@@ tics ought therefore always to have trau@@ mat@@ ured , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia should be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid barrier .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum capacity will reach within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the operation is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is based in it that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed Res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of hus@@ band@@ ry ( hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ se@@ - ) sites in the human@@ ist molecule were moved into consideration ; none of the met@@ abolic syndrome has been active .
based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity a repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , for car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive elast@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data can recognize no particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended that the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle from the refrigerator was taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin should rise at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it gets under the manual for the first use .
some patients who appeared hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal in human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or differently compared to their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adapted , when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S Commission for the In@@ tra@@ deshow of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of a quick effective insulin must be applied , then the amount of the long @-@ effective insulin .
3 If when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adaptation is necessary , it may be necessary for the first dosage , or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before traveling through several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such travels allow insulin and meals to be taken or taken during meals at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints in the administration location Gel@@ eg@@ . - Local inter @-@ sensitive reaction on the injection area During the insulin @-@ therapy may occur local su@@ pers@@ ens@@ ity actions ( Rö@@ ss@@ ing , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics ought therefore always to have trau@@ mat@@ ured , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia should be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid barrier .
clinical trial in an intensive care unit to treat hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 di@@ abe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic patients who reduced greater surgical intervention ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) which reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4,6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum capacity will reach within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of the operation is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ abe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assum@@ ption that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic profile in children and adolescents are similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations 0.05 % / ml - 1.0 i.e. / ml insulin is human in the in@@ fusion liquid 0.9 % sodium chloride , 5 % D glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mol / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d should be required when patient is necessary , it may be necessary for the first dosage , or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before traveling through several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such travels allow insulin and meals to be taken or taken during meals at other times .
13 General diseases and complaints in the administration location Gel@@ eg@@ . - Local Auth@@ orities reaction on the injection area During the insulin @-@ therapy local self @-@ sensitivity reactions ( Rö@@ ss@@ ing , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) .

this can happen : • If you in@@ ject too much insulin • if you can eat too little or a meal • If you do more than anything else .
let the end folder of your Nov@@ o@@ let Sli@@ p@@ ens always set up if it is not in use to protect it from light .
take the closing plate . • Des@@ ire the rubber cord with a medical cu@@ pp@@ et • Use the protective case from an Nov@@ o@@ fine injection needle . • Use the injection needle straight and tigh@@ tly on Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ let ( Figure A ) • Take the big outer cap of the injection needle and the internal cap of the injection needle .
to avoid the injection of air and make a correct dosage : • Hold your Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle to top • Take a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
if air bub@@ bles are present , this will continue to keep up in the cartridge , then turn the cartridge for a click on the right ( Figure B ) • While the injection needle continues to top , press the press stud very in ( Figure C ) • Now , press the pressure button on top of the inj@@ ector ( Figure C ) • Now the tip of the inj@@ ector has to be applied to a drop of insulin .
• Put the end folder to the finished pen , indicates that the number 0 is opposite the dosing stamp ( Figure D ) • Control , if the push button is pressed completely .
if the pressure button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale at the closing folder indicates 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pressure button moves to the outside while you turn the finishing folder • The scale under the push button ( press stud ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Please note the highest number you can see on the press stud • Ad@@ just the two numbers to obtain the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the end folder simply back@@ wards or back@@ wards until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is down below and you will feel the end folder and then put it on again that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite .
be sure to press only during injection on the press button • Keep the pressure button after injection , until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .
it is possibly in@@ accurate • You can not adjust the dose that is higher than the number of remaining units you can use the balance scale , how much insulin is still remaining , but you can &apos;t use it to stop or select your dose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used for patients who have already encoun@@ tered signs of cryst@@ alline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in joints ) or poison no@@ des ( stones ) , i.e. larger ur@@ at@@ alline deposits , which can lead to joint and bone compensation .
if the ur@@ inary tract is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , tox@@ ins can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients must be taken at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic another drug to the prevention of gyp@@ sy .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involved in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other drugs for treating hyper@@ ur@@ gical ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received just 100 mg a day .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract was in the blood in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 262 ) of patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily spent 120 mg in the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ac@@ id@@ ate in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash , and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac problems in the pre@@ history , an increased risk of adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood @-@ effective in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia caused by disease which have already been led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one from the patient &apos;s history or present g@@ utter no@@ des and / or a plaster ) .
after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase of 120 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ l / l ) can still be considered valid for dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / L ( 357 µ@@ l / l ) .
in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment the efficacy and safety were not fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there is no experiences in organ transplan@@ t , the application of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ com@@ promising cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid drugs , it can occur during the treatment to a acute poison effect , because due to the lowering of the serum resin , ur@@ inary tract deposits may be mobili@@ zed in tissues .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome , absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the ur@@ ine in rare cases occur so far that it comes to a storage in ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed with slight de@@ cel@@ eration of the liver function in treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended before the start of the Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ ic treatment and in further progress according to clinical findings of the liver function ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ aire has no change @-@ effective studies at the lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O shirt may lead to an increase in the ophy@@ ophy@@ sa@@ vi@@ ate ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O Hem@@ mer ) .
at the same time , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with a rise in the Feb@@ lin@@ ux@@ exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not in connection with a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ . ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without requiring a dose adaptation for Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study with subjects used 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a daily 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to a possible weak primary effect of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acids , the gast@@ nes@@ ium@@ - hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide contains the recording of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and caused a decrease of the C@@ max at 32 % , but not a significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not close to side effects of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at , pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful in use of a vehicle , serving of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they are reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC would not affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the study reported cardiovascular disease was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no real connection with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at could be found .
these patients treated risk factors were an arter@@ ios@@ s disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) side effects found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at , and the ( tester Assessment ) could be reported in a total of more than once reported , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who at the same time treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no serious skin attacks or heavy over@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies in the open @-@ time extension studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with a fre@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment condition were reported in all February ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data .
the following treatment condition were either reported in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Studies of Phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , ins@@ om@@ nia , h@@ yst@@ eria , skin col@@ oration , clou@@ dy dysfunction , increase of potassium concentration in the blood , increase of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic concentration in the blood , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , reduction in number of white blood cells .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients suffering from hyper@@ ur@@ gical and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point in each study was the proportion of patients who received the last three months of a certain serum concentration of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ er@@ in@@ ine value of study ( Bas@@ eline ) of ≤ 1,5 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x per day ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ er@@ in@@ in@@ worth to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / gram .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / L ( 357 µ@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed significant significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional recommended dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um@@ eration values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum resin rise to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently on the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x per day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ er@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function reduces the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function limitation ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x per day ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x per day ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x per day ) .
there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of response of serum resin concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe cardi@@ oid dysfunction ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of 10 mg / dl ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act @-@ study ) had taken together at the beginning of the study ( Bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ al concentration of ≥ 10 mg / gram .
the data collected in two years collected data from the Phase 3 extension study showed that in less than 3 % of the patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 , a decrease in treatment required ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against treatment ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk of low vitamin D mirrors .
the patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ ant supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the meal , the patient must not lie down after taking the tablet at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 is already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in relation to increase the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to increase the effectiveness of vitamin D mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who were excluding Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid data before that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone remains .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive system such as abdom@@ inal pain , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( arr@@ he@@ a ) , so@@ res ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) , beaten abdom@@ en ( infl@@ ated abdom@@ inal ) as well as aci@@ dic attachment .
patients with any su@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( aller@@ gy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who do not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medication ( including ant@@ acids , calcium um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ ant supplements ) for the day .
the following remarks are just to follow in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed down only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients are supposed to cut the tablet into the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ep@@ tic ul@@ cus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
oil ha@@ ired reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ ars , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under in@@ gest@@ ion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these heavier and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that are supposed to be pointed out on possible mal@@ ign@@ an@@ ic reactions , and the patient should be pointed out during the occurr@@ ence of symptoms or di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing the drug to retri@@ eve your medicines and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ous side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that would continue to take on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ em@@ ale ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ages are passed to the patient and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

clinical assessment due to the treatment doctor is decisive for the treatment plan in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients are supposed to be noted that they should take the intake of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet at the next morning after being noticed .
you should not take two tablets a day , but intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on week@@ day .
other diseases resulting in the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and Hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate Food and Dr@@ inks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when they are taken at the same time .
as a result , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least for 30 minutes before using other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of ordinary medicines without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable in the pregnancy still of l@@ act@@ ating women .

since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company presented the results of previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ dig@@ m as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients were presented with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application was compared with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was removed after a treatment duration of a year ( as often as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ t and examined how adv@@ ances in comparison to pro@@ dig@@ f / pro@@ dig@@ m of the body is taken .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this may lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ or higher immune system .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage ; represent@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ aging control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ mirror regulations ( see below ) recommendations
after conversion from pro@@ dig@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ si should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure measured as Tal@@ si level was similar to both formulation as well as in transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ si are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation by agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposition in the immediate ob@@ itu@@ ation phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take a modification of the agra@@ f @-@ dose @-@ schem@@ as to the ste@@ ady state .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative phase of medication , the Tac@@ eri@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated using a dose of ca .
duration of application To be adher@@ ed to the suppression of transplan@@ t must be maintained ; therefore a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be stated .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions the oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift of the morning .
other dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tations The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift of the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from pro@@ dig@@ f to Adv@@ sp@@ f must be changed from gra@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dose of pro@@ dig@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over in relation to a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a change@@ over from other immune soup to the agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended initial dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts must begin .
cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are revers@@ ed on the agra@@ f is a oral initial dose of 0,15 mg / kg / day to be taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ ts , although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ ent in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and rect@@ al patients , in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in the oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function In the feeding area can be necessary for patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the n@@ ep@@ hr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of cardi@@ oid function ( including a regular determination of the serum Cre@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .

recommendations to the Tal@@ mirror in thorou@@ gh@@ bred The dose should be based on clinical assessment of rein@@ de@@ formation and toler@@ ability in single @-@ blood pressure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ talks @-@ controls .
it is recommended to conduct common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ si during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ talks about tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ dig@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustments , changes of immune @-@ corro@@ sive therapy or to con@@ current use of substances which could change the Tac@@ eri@@ lim@@ us Full Control Con@@ centr@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ance a drug with a low Clear@@ ance is the adjustment of the dose may require multiple days until ste@@ ady state has entered .
the data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the level of the valley is not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent placement of liver , kidney disease and cardi@@ ac disease were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe adverse events , including transplan@@ ts , or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub @-@ or exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage ; represent@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ aging control of a medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of growing patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which proved to be treated with other immune agents than re@@ frac@@ tory therap@@ ist@@ ent , no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation were found guilty .
in addition to the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t gra@@ fts and transplan@@ ts in child transplan@@ ts , no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation were found guilty .
due to possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a down@@ turn of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of plant extracts , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um punc@@ ture ) , or other plant belts during a treatment with supplem@@ entation ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood has been offered since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Blood levels may be subjected to serious fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases a chamber or s@@ ept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy had been observed in rare cases , which therefore can therefore occur under the agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid fatigue loading and eyel@@ ids .
like with other immune soup , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection using a high protection factor .
if patients receiving Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for p@@ res like head@@ aches , changing consciousness status , cr@@ amps and vision disorders , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ ations , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels may change to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining the same concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly distinctive interaction was associated with An@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica like K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of g@@ astro@@ intestinal defects , results .
highly sensitive pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute dis@@ gu@@ sting actions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism may deterior@@ ate .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us degra@@ ded the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormone exposure , especially c@@ auti@@ ous measures can be c@@ auti@@ ously recommended by decisions .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potential the cle@@ aring of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a low number of investigations to transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ ships do not provide evidence that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immune soup , an increased risk of adverse events in terms of course and the result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure there is a monitoring of the new@@ born on any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular on its impact on the kidneys ) .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) .
the dosage and frequency of application is after that the treatment is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of blood cells in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is manufactured according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which one gene has been incorporated into the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , which is similar , but it does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of blood cells and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood periods were awarded &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human existence factor VIII , m@@ ash or ham@@ ster protein or one of other parts .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval of B@@ ax@@ ter AG to take a approval for the In@@ take of Adv@@ ance in the European Union .
dosage : the dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII of the defect , following the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity is not to fall below the stated plasma bars ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients is over .
during treatment , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections is caused by a reasonable determination of factor VIII @-@ plasma screens .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and feature different sem@@ esters .
3 Pre@@ vention of proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis by patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII non @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ activities does not reach or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII of VIII is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures will be affected .
the speed should be carried out after testing the patient , whereby a maximum inj@@ ector rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is well @-@ known ac@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII created Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is at the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ nesty @-@ known inhibit@@ ory development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the repe@@ aled of ( low@@ job ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare impact of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , beyond the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding there is no experiences .
in the highest number of patients the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who had previously untreated patients with previously untreated patients receiving a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( frequency : 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated from the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood pressure factor VIII occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under contin@@ gen@@ al A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ots was maintained during the whole time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as Clear@@ ance @-@ Rate showed a sufficient value on the 15 @-@ postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE sets a low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) were determined by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) to a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients had previously untreated patients suffering from 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated protein was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ ers against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persist@@ ing peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms to be found on an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash , r@@ ash and increased number of os@@ in@@ oph@@ onic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ oms in several repet@@ itive product texts were reported in the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has also been evalu@@ ating the benefit @-@ risk w@@ rest@@ ation as a positive rating , but in account that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of safety profile from A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required to apply for the approval of approval in 5 years another renewal process .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Rights Po@@ wers ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company receives its application for approval by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Mr. Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
but usually the breast , the brain , the bones or the skin parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and backs ) are affected by it .
this is a kind of virus that was gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves , and thus could not trigger the infections of the human being .
in fact , Adv@@ ex@@ in would be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from which is not def@@ ective in the human body @-@ existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company put data from a study with one patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub @-@ building , in the bone and the brain .
in accordance with CH@@ MP the answers from the company had examined questions , still some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the evaluation of the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP view , the inj@@ ections of the ex@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors has not been demonstrated in response to patients .
the Committee also had respect concerning the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven enough that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way , that it is neither for the environment nor for people who are in contact with the patient .
the company set the CH@@ MP not having regard to whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered mode release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ ium is used for treating symptoms of seasonal Rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ ylo@@ ft , caused by aller@@ gy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ ium is twice daily one tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( hidden nose ) are denied .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main memory measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ ylo@@ ft symptoms that were reported from the patient prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients contributed their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , such as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the ha@@ ylo@@ ft symptoms besides the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients receiving aer@@ onau@@ aze revenues , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in alone .
if only the threshold of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , ir@@ rig@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , mental stress , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , ins@@ om@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used to treat patients suffering from des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drugs for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) .
aer@@ onau@@ tics may also be applied in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , or hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain bleeding ) or have a risk for ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced that SP Europe granted approval for the public transport of aer@@ onau@@ tics in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low up in the whole ( i.e. , without scrat@@ ches or cut off ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used due to the failure of data on the failure and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after crossing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in can take off .
after the decline of the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane in the upper bre@@ aths , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in contains the medicine also contra@@ sted in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ bo@@ id , Cab@@ er@@ gol@@ in , ergonom@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ amine or other de@@ formation ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ yl le@@ phr@@ in , eph@@ edr@@ in , Oxy@@ gen , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ design , and the data are not sufficient to cover corresponding recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ onau@@ tics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function distur@@ bing and the data are not sufficient to cover corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical sy@@ mptom@@ atic ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ ache ) .
for the treatment of following patient groups to be careful : • Pati@@ ents under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder problems or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ ital in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can remove at least 48 hours prior to carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their degree .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clinical @-@ relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ edel@@ ic tests no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo had been detected , ir@@ respective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs can &apos;t be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ itions in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the disorder of the application of aer@@ onau@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison with normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of v@@ ascular properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients , however , should be clari@@ fied , that in very rare cases , it may occur in very rare cases to lead the traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a CN@@ S depression ( consolidation , ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ apps ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ads , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als .

for a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flight power including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective s@@ enti@@ veness or the tasks associated with the flies .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of s@@ me@@ ats in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in in the recommended dosage may produce more sympath@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal aller@@ g@@ ic Rhin@@ itis with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant efficacy of aer@@ onau@@ aze tablets , determined using the total score for the sympt@@ om ( except nas@@ al s@@ skin sw@@ elling ) significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ onau@@ aze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determines from the nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ onau@@ tics tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
within a single dose of a single dose for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
according to the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in was reached on day 10 .
in the context of an pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist multi @-@ cycle study conducted with formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was found badly damaged .
a components study study shows that the exposition ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in was the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity a repet@@ itive gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ productive ox@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not recognize any special dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the effects of the effects were generally consistent with pseu@@ do@@ x@@ eph@@ edr@@ in .
in re@@ productive @-@ fiction studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do eph@@ edra was in@@ hal@@ ved in the oral gift of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bit in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal Rhin@@ itis and two trials involving asth@@ ma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ ch , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies were submitted to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup solution , the solution to insert and use the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application for children are un@@ think@@ able .
for allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us received an average decline of sympt@@ om scores ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of sympt@@ om scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission announced that SP Europe granted approval for placing on the market per@@ missions of A@@ eri@@ us , throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent aller@@ g@@ ischer rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for juven@@ iles from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease and can be resumed after the symptoms of symptoms and when repe@@ aled .
due to the persist@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended in the aller@@ gy period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not reinforced with the benefit of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients , however , should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases , that it may result in very rare cases to use in@@ activity or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including aller@@ g@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently rec@@ alled side effects that was reported more frequently than in placebo had ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , oral cav@@ ity ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common balance of head@@ ache , that occurred in 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were given , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human power cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the Ad@@ op@@ oli@@ ek@@ ül@@ s P sel@@ ess to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered over a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
for a single dos@@ si@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight power including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective s@@ enti@@ veness or the tasks associated with the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the reduction of symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ room , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the total score of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the treatment by seas@@ onally allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was deputy chief for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the ae@@ ti@@ ology , is quite pro@@ spective to different forms and chronic patients become easier .
since the contamination of a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ul@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected to carry out in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria for an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the ratio of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ics were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching yield by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and the wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal Rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no basis points for a clinical @-@ relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo and not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ si@@ ac study involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) is not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed a compar@@ ably degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no quality or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity project of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ productive elast@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will not recognize any special dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals using allergic rhin@@ itis in aller@@ g@@ ic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent aller@@ g@@ ischer rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years of age caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data is based on the treatment of an infectious rhin@@ itis with as@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper bre@@ aths or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin studies playing a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experienced a higher substance load ( see below paragraph 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age related to met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze is identical to children who met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze the normal .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ing or suc@@ rose @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency this medication should not take away .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not further strengthened with the benefit of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall th@@ reading of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including aller@@ g@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who arrived for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , applied in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in an adult dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) had been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in clinical trials , a recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and youth had no higher frequency of s@@ me@@ ats in comparison to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ ot@@ ori@@ k .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol is not affected by taking alcohol to the ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the reduction of symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ room , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ck@@ ons , lac@@ ri@@ cane and tu@@ bing of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the total score of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets would effectively reduce the treatment by seas@@ onally allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the ratio of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
the prevalence of this limited phenomena was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ic multi @-@ dose study using sy@@ rup forms in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a scheduled half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no basis points for a clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days with adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies revealed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max @-@ values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was similar in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs can &apos;t be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ la@@ vers with child @-@ saf@@ er polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications , including aller@@ g@@ ic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were used , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at was developed well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examination , vit@@ ality and EC@@ G intervals .
a statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) had been applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of s@@ me@@ ats in comparison to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flight power including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective det@@ oxi@@ fication or the tasks associated with the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the reduction of symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ room , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the total score of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the treatment by seas@@ onally allergic rhin@@ itis .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially dealt with the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect the flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a strain of flu virus , which may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a influenza pan@@ de@@ mic will break when a new tribe of flu virus appears that easy to spread from man to human beings , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus during the vaccine , and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a fast antibody in contact with a flu virus .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ strange ) , has been cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
one inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; Good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby , the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA ( EMEA ) vacc@@ ines requirements .
if you want to participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
for more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as solution for inser@@ tion , but it cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined .
car@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed only if the doctor has checked , which has previously taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , taken with 100 mg of it@@ on@@ av@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ ase according to body weight .
ag@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drug drugs and holds them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can cause damage to the immune system , so that the development of associated infections and diseases are delayed .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not treated with Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine ac@@ red R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults which previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
major inde@@ xes for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change in vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a vir@@ al load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , only very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the vir@@ us@@ load increased the vir@@ us@@ load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger decline of the vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks when compared to patients who continue their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ b@@ abo@@ r or other parts of the other .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products that are just like car@@ gener@@ a and should be harmful in high concentrations in blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV patients suffering from HIV infections , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection that can be caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drug to treat patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or previously untreated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
in general , A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ac@@ tic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee established that the benefit of aging in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to adopt the general public transport of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
aging is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
usually act capsules can be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic boo@@ sting of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance patterns and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is a solution to take 14 % less than Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase have applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ kl@@ ets ) , higher doses must be applied to ast@@ o@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
car@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the failure of data on the failure and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ac@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function reduces from 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be achieved in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the sub@@ strate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um punc@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r during the intake of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy is not leading to the healing of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with as@@ oning prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually act capsules are to be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk for heavy liver inter@@ actions with potential deadly actions .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis patients show increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids are not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is associated with the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including morph@@ ing C@@ ushing and support of epi@@ di@@ aries function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the rein@@ forcement of the H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the concentration of active concentration are available .
in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma bricks of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ sts can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ b@@ ulation , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ho@@ bic symptoms , especially if there are still very low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity in relation to the high propeller content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is con@@ ven@@ ed in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
phase 5 should be set to 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an Ex@@ ac@@ ity of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medication which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical and dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated .
in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ og@@ thro@@ es .
at the time of introduction , HIV @-@ infected patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop inflamm@@ atory reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ le e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the application of Kor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ otherapy , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the sub@@ strate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low @-@ therapeutic width of ag@@ ulation with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly exchanged via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable side effects were observed in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um punc@@ ture ) The serum mirror of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient has already acquired Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ reversible level and , if possible , remove the vir@@ al load and remove the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adap@@ tion for one of the medicine is not necessary if clo@@ avi@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also E@@ gre@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , showing efficacy and dis@@ comfort of this treatment diagram .
at 52 % , Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) have been achieved , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ fit of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study for use of ag@@ ase in combination with di@@ than@@ k@@ in , but is recommended due to the ant@@ it@@ azi@@ des component of di@@ than@@ k@@ in , however , the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require dose adjustments .
treatment with E@@ gre@@ av@@ ency in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data allow Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cells .
if this drug will be applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out because an accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Ri@@ kul@@ ut@@ in resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration of up to 193 % and thereby resulting in an increase in effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ut@@ in side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ut@@ in will inc@@ ur together with ag@@ ase , becomes at least half of the recommended dose in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma levels of both pharmac@@ euticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily lead to an increase of C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day , without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with ag@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as a general meeting , as it can occur in res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va who are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can lead to an ab@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma beams of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
serum concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ j@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ is@@ c@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication .
the simultaneous intake of an@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentration and intensi@@ fying P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ext , vision disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were obtained twice daily with 50 µg of fluor@@ ine pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased about 86 % ( 90 % interval interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is associated with the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose ingredients are strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma beams with the simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since Plas@@ ma@@ pi@@ es increases this H@@ MG Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations except for stabili@@ zation of mirrors , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while simultaneous use of a car@@ gener@@ a Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution applies .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ho@@ bic symptoms , especially if there are still very low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se of historical compar@@ ability of historical compar@@ ability , no recommendation is to be given , as the am@@ b@@ ulation dose is administered when Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
for simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with ag@@ ase , an increased inspection of IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or gain of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods are recommended to contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse events of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of as@@ oning ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful thought of possible uses for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ b@@ abo@@ r @-@ related materials were detected in the milk of activated rats , but it is not known whether am@@ b@@ abo@@ r explo@@ res people into breast milk .
a reproduction study to tr@@ ash rats that was administered by the collapse in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during a down@@ time .
the further development of im@@ perf@@ ecting , including fermentation and reproduction , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the disorder of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moder@@ ately distinct , occurred early and led sel@@ dom to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of ag@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of gr@@ ating disease .
most of the adverse events are made from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease of pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gen@@ ase had received twice a day .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , used by the exam@@ ining doctors related to study medic@@ ations and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well under the treatment of severe laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including an losses of peripheral and natural fat tissue , multi@@ layer intra@@ oral and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ s@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ ite fatty acids ( j@@ acks ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated , who were treated with am@@ id@@ vi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bul@@ ky ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s the patients treated under Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) among 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes normally have been slightly pronounced , ery@@ them@@ y or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ ath@@ ic nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and appeared in the rule during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors such as HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of introduction , HIV @-@ infected patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop inflamm@@ atory reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily , were similar and incidence of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed among all aspects of tri@@ glyc@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ gen@@ ase in patients with low @-@ controlled R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed in the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures .

an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ors ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0,08 µ@@ M of acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication during people is not defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r met@@ alli@@ ons were observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r related treatment schemes - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at sixteen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Pot@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically occurred up to week 48 with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ical .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates from 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 were included in patients with prot@@ esters and did not show resistance patterns , which were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and of its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with four @-@ controlled trials over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are on :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be used to estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / M / M / W , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / W , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated clinical interpre@@ tations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against am@@ b@@ abo@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain clo@@ pe@@ achment against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistant between am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 f@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r resistance fighters , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated patients , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ ets ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ ets ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ p@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or of isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early sl@@ ump of an acci@@ dental therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of ag@@ ulation in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( Vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ controlled R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
a hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis determined the non @-@ submission of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group with regard to the time @-@ adjusted average changes from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma up to 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ born ch@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with altogether 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was found three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of which together with A@@ gen@@ ase received N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml of median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered for the treatment of an unexpected benefit with PI in the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ king &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase .
according to oral administration , the average length ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .

the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .

the apparent distribution of mani@@ folds is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood circulation system to the fabric .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the field in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ b@@ ulation which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .

when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation is observed , which caused a treatment required and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions were performed at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water treatment , which necess@@ itated a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other kut@@ an application for the treatment of external fig@@ s in the genital area and periods , no clinical experiences have so far been observed .
limited data suggest a increased rate of Fei@@ g@@ war@@ zen@@ reductions at HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the elim@@ ination of the cow@@ or@@ ption .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm about the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair attachment was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy , or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the re@@ generation of treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be treated with super@@ fi@@ ci@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , other suitable therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experiences are observed , therefore the application of previously untreated tum@@ ours are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy is made .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has not been investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lip area within the li@@ pp@@ en@@ r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take the intensity of intensity or go after removal of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions may cause large dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed to a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 acc@@ les@@ ions accepted a less full healing rate as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ul@@ ating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ ologic treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animals are no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ red@@ ness development , the development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one time after exceptional use of qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during a stand@@ still time .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in relation side effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions on the location of the treatment of Fei@@ g@@ war@@ mers ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly reported on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in relation side effects include complaints on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ el@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine patients of a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III adverse events are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in this studies were a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the effects found by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis were listed below .
according to test plans , the clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream frequently asked to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion / covers ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ 3 ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan of clinical signs , this studies shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , it was often very frequent in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and too heavy scar@@ ce formation ( 19 % ) .
clinical trials investig@@ ating the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was detected al@@ pe@@ zie with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment office or in the ambient range .
the unique unique oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically severe adverse events which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , were norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous liquid norm@@ alized .
during the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ sine and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the fig@@ s is superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the fig@@ s were treated completely ; this one was with placebo in 20 % of the patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was examined five times a week for 6 weeks in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .

the approved indicator of expression , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occurs normally not in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies , the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0,1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml of the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 75 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; that shows an extended re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposition showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low after top@@ ical application of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ z bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mat@@ h tox@@ icity in rats introduced doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; for a period of four months , there was no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of mice at mal@@ ice in mice was induced within three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not dirty , is a risk for humans due to systematic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors emerged in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cream , so@@ oner and larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with a diagnosis of b@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that do not stand with brain or nerve cells ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ co@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not dismant@@ led , and is thus compens@@ ated in most organ@@ ics in the body and dam@@ aging them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the MP@@ S I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , re@@ juven@@ ating movements , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary disease .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients need appropriate drugs under the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the ur@@ ine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had an ordinary liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , r@@ arch , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion process .
very frequent adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may react to patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be notified every year all new information which may be known , checking and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated to observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued the G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. , a permit for placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with a diagnosis of b@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ etic met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient helps to increase every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for those patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency is not determined , and for those patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions who are defined as every side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients continue to be monitored continuously , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment in which rest@@ or@@ ating equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed , usually within 3 months from treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience above the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be c@@ auti@@ ous due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ences of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / iri@@ pro@@ fen can be weighed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered to consider .
the in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / iris pro@@ ps / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on matern@@ ity milk , it is recommended to do not feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants below 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable pharmaceutical transactions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and over with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often performed in the following table after the following skins : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some cases with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper bre@@ aches and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ history there were severe reactions to , including bron@@ chi@@ ds , bre@@ aches and fac@@ ial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe displacement and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment with a ser@@ oc@@ on version , with a heavier displacement of patients under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early departure from the study ) were detected by Radio@@ immun@@ o@@ deficiency ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ body levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG mirrors in the har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ ors had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low @-@ neutral effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to in@@ tr@@ ash the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of adverse pharmaceutical operations , even if the emergence of adverse pharmaceutical operations typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the basis for the enzy@@ mes is located in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the preventing a further accumulation of ec@@ tivity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ que@@ ens , the most likely above Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients were random@@ ized by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phenomenon .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ ted exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking distance .
all patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of lung function and ability to improve in the following table .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical @-@ scale and absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ ic treatment of 22 ( 85 % ) of the study reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n ( µg / m@@ g. of Kre@@ at@@ ine ) was found until the study remained constant .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous health manifest@@ ation between the patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe temp@@ oral form and 4 in the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased GA@@ G@@ - Spiegel in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) noted after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe displacement form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with middle course form had a normal spiritual development speed whereas only limited or even any progress in cogn@@ itive performance was observed .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the co@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ atics were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage ema with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be demonstrated in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an appropriate alternative ; however , it is not proven that long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ atics is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate every new information , rate annually , and if required , the summary of the drug features will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at a time gift , tox@@ icity at a repet@@ itive gift and re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity , the pre@@ valent data can not recognize any special dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other drugs , except with the under 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a other drug against cancer ) in patients who are not yet treated with cancer ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer alone cannot be removed or spreads slightly to other parts of the body ) . • for advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not affect the epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who previously had not been treated previously , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies as all therapy .
to reduce adverse events , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and intake an inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be applied in addition , or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic@@ um &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be shifted upward or reduced the dose .
thus , the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed de@@ cel@@ es the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer active effect in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ am@@ el@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms in A@@ lim@@ ta in a prime study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , who had previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were treated on average 12,@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received a chemotherapy , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , patients who do not attack the epithel@@ ium cells in which treatment of A@@ lim@@ ta increased longer survival times than with the reference medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced that Eli L@@ illy Neder@@ land B.@@ V. granted approval for placing on the market per@@ missions of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any feed bottle must be consumed with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ z@@ sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic col@@ chi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ sized pl@@ ywood epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono@@ therap@@ ist is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ ry in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze car@@ cin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one must be given a cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid in the day before and on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ ry must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third party running cycle .
in patients who received p@@ emet@@ ry should be created prior to each gift a complete blood image should be created , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te .
the Alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held under the use of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of therapy cycles .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to the evidence in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ ist or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree of 2 blood pressure .
should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient value before treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients with 2 dose reduction of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at the occurr@@ ence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no evidence that in patients aged 65 years of age or over , in comparison to patients under the age of 65 an increased epi@@ dem@@ i@@ dem@@ ny exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for the in@@ correct and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require dose adjustments that can go beyond the recommended dose adjustments for all patients .
data in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( when availability of liver metast@@ ases ) is not especially examined in studies .
patients must be monitored in regard to the bone market , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before the absolute neut@@ ron number once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the threshold value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ema , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tic and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the previous therapy cycles - see section 4.2 .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ otic tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was taken as if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients must be applied , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ - lac@@ tic measure to be applied to reduction of tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally , 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must take from N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , associated risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accumulation of result in the trans@@ cell@@ ular area should become a dra@@ ining of the result before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another Cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated sp@@ elling is not recommended ( with the exception of yellow fever , these im@@ itation is non @-@ trained ) not recommended ( see paragraph 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible sk@@ el@@ - re@@ productive of re@@ productive capacity , men should be pointed out before the treatment process , in order to submit consulting on the sperm risk .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed de@@ position with a result of a recur@@ rence of side effects .
therefore , caution when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and minim@@ ally , 2 days after the therapy with punc@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - are avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the instrument status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as in an@@ de@@ - ras an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected by applying severe birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful removal of the user for the mother and the risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the course of treatment , advice regarding the sperm cells out .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in the mother &apos;s milk and un@@ wanted effects during the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om and that were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om which received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mono@@ therap@@ ist .
adverse reactions of adverse events : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( on the basis of the available data from spont@@ an@@ onym@@ ously ) .

the clinical @-@ relevant laboratory tox@@ icity Degree 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 in the emerging phase 3 P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Mon@@ o@@ therap@@ i@@ awards , except Neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Al@@ an@@ int@@ ran@@ ny ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ astic anti@@ fol@@ ate that strengthens its effect by interrup@@ ting the cell @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed as Anti@@ fol@@ ate with several wars of aggression ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ ves@@ u@@ cle@@ i m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) that are fol@@ lic@@ able key enzy@@ mes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ in@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ i .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with mal@@ ign@@ an@@ il@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients had a clinical significant advantage of an median 2.8 @-@ month longer survival compared to such patients who were only iced with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received a test medication in the treatment arm ( randomised and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant pic@@ eli@@ ac disease was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- arms ( 218 patients ) .
differences between the two treatment arms demonstrated by improvement of lung functions in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the period of time in check .
a multic@@ enter , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after receiving chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect fell to favour of patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly not pl@@ ywood epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 9.3 versus 7.4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) is similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the ITT population analyses and support non @-@ submission of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination with the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in over 5,1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.9 ) for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .

it is applied in overweight adults with a Body Mass Index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet .
patients who can take no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes have been hanged , they cannot build some fats in the diet , thereby caused about a quarter of the fat caused by food into the intest@@ ines .
in a third study in 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , all@@ i had 60 mg total weight , compared with an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with stu@@ h@@ ld@@ ings , stu@@ ff@@ ld@@ ge , fet@@ al sec@@ on@@ gs ( F@@ ä@@ zes ) , cran@@ ial ( wind ) , and soft chairs .
it must not be used for patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the transplan@@ tation with transplan@@ t patients ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be applied in patients who are absorbed by a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ing syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients are taken from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to allow Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K into the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , non @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are not enough data regarding effectiveness and safety .
however , or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ated , is necessary for elderly and / or kidney function in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Comp@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or one of other components • Equ@@ al treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • chronic pain@@ absorption • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy treatment ( see section 4.6 ) • Rep@@ ly treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of onset of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control can be used , patients who take a drug against diabetes before initi@@ ating a drug with all@@ i to consult a physician or chem@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic should be adjusted .
patients who should intake all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or higher cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage should be adjusted to this medication .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation inc@@ tive measures in order to prevent this in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of oral contra@@ sts ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration .
in combination with or@@ list@@ at or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values might be affected ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the standard range .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed at a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received a minor decline of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of in@@ gen@@ om@@ men@@ em fats is avoided .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily .
the number of skins are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects , which were found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
10 . it is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may result in terms of possible or actual astro@@ intestinal effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people , without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of those reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human beings and animal , a system@@ ic effect on human beings and animal can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ modi@@ fying properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect puts in the l@@ umen of stomach and upper d@@ une by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies showed that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ch is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 , the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , fet@@ ched diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was calculated as follows : as a variation of the body weight in the course of the course ( Table 1 ) and as part of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

7 In general , non @-@ met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at was found in plasma and very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with ob@@ struc@@ tive patients who was given at least system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis Lac@@ ton ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to the sec@@ ession of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine Group ) , which were close to 42 % of total plasma concentration .

Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ in@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal medicine that can be used as Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because of the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , is prevented on the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi have no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi were not canc@@ eled ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission announced that Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. granted approval for placing the placing on the market of Alo@@ xi into the entire European Union .
al@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vom@@ iting from nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer risk .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding one before the chemotherapy issued Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty reductions or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored according to the injection .
however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extended the Q@@ T interval or to patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or extended to such an extension .
besides in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic gift , al@@ xi may not be used in those days after receiving chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not undergo tum@@ ours of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ in@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , diox@@ in , diox@@ in , ra@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ra@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ ine in@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ in@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless necessary , it is considered necessary by the treated doctor .
in clinical trials , the most frequently observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of adverse events ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ ity actions and reactions in the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing report .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins were similar to adverse events such as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose of action relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time spent 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on Day 1 .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ intervals including the respective effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ äle to block and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EK@@ G effects of i.@@ f. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration to an initial elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately in total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the medium @-@ cell patients measured in 11 test@@ ine patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ac@@ tic simulation emer@@ ges that at once daily an intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron achieved total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after a unique intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg was measured ; however , the C@@ max was measured after the application of 0.75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro diagnostic studies on met@@ abolic trials have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and the CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 being involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination According to an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the recommended dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ine projection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance , 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function distur@@ bing the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination times and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered adequate for the maximum of human exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 of the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was given in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of people ) , which have been given daily for two years , resulted in a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ dem@@ n@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be minim@@ ized for people .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the pro@@ hibit@@ ing of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon was similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which should be similar to the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ring &quot; ) .
liter@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) Hepatitis C ( one by a vir@@ al inf@@ ection rendered liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage increases damage , also the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which one gene has to be associated to the formation of the field .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( composition structure , composition and purity of the drug , effici@@ encies , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference surgeon in 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non business activity only . the EMEA is . what were the greatest concerns that have sent the CH@@ MP to the Recommend@@ ation to make approval for placing on the market .
in addition , concerns were posted immediately , that data on the stability of the field and to @-@ market@@ able medicines should not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease increased again in more patients than the reference ring ; Alp@@ eon also had more side effects .
in addition , the test used in the study was to evaluate the question , to what extent the medication is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with pit@@ chers , incoming skin infection ) and small in@@ infected blood vessels ( R@@ iss@@ or or Schn@@ it@@ s@@ unden ) , fir@@ ing and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used for treatment of infections which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because the al@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again to investigate alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
major inde@@ xes of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients were treated with treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , al@@ clo@@ go was found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by the treatment of abst@@ in@@ ous cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been demonstrated or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the order .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go passed over the short @-@ time treatment of the following su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , bev@@ elled or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit to transfer Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
the patients who showed no improvement in these within two to three days are supposed to be considered and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sen@@ si@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation caused by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment , the treatment is ab@@ orted , the sage leaves carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections which is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary effects , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative treatment is supposed to be considered when after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved according to top@@ ical application in the poor or intact su@@ perf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment on the poor skin of healthy adult men around 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients can not be required if top@@ ographic Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity according to oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement about impact on the birth and the red@@ ness / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued , or the therapy with al@@ clo@@ go has to be completed / ended , is between the benefits of silent for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the su@@ re@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections which al@@ ar@@ go applied , the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the administration location which was about 1 % of patients .
mode of effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of effect of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s of the bacterial reef , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al interaction anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bonds of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ centre .
due to Bin@@ ding to this binding place to block P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block some P @-@ bonds inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s units .
should be due to the local pre@@ val@@ ency of resistance the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least in some cases of infection , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates are sensitive to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ance factors should be considered as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ en@@ ci@@ din ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion daily and up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the rehear@@ sal took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirts .
metabol@@ ism in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low interest of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for the oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were indications of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gen@@ mutation and / or chromosome effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , respectively in cultures of human lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ o@@ idal test chromos@@ om@@ aler effects .
there was neither male imp@@ ul@@ arity at female rats signs of restricted pig@@ ments with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times more exposure than the highest exposure of human being ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 )
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study to rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tools ( reduced body weight ) and delayed tox@@ icity .

ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination program , with a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only used if in immun@@ isation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be brought to an end from two doses .
Ambi@@ rix or other Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine may be given if a pick @-@ up dose may be given for hepatitis A or B .
vacc@@ ines are involved in reducing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien@@ ation &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults and has been approved in the Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix kids are given in the frame of one from three doses existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix included identical ingredients , some of the data used by the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient temperature between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to protect anti@@ body concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was at a 6 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , app@@ et@@ it@@ deficiency , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient Temperature may react to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ous s.@@ a. granted approval for the market introduction of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ination outlets , with the first dose to be given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a dri@@ cal vacc@@ ination is intended for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ine vacc@@ ines or with a combined vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis C inhibit@@ ors ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody synthesis observed in the same magn@@ itude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ine vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether the immune @-@ competent individuals who have found on a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as it may also be protected by immune memory by immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ectors of inj@@ ectors , the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine for medical treatment and monitoring .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ m@@ pf@@ sch@@ ema is recommended using the combination @-@ quality , the 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , there is no sufficient supply of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ body value , so that in these cases the gift may be required for further vacc@@ ination outlets .
since an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration may lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in cases of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or bleeding problems , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , as it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined dietary and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ri@@ red@@ ness vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ o@@ therapeutic therapy or in patients with immune defects , there must be no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ination of these formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , Mat@@ ri@@ val@@ itis , head@@ aches , and fever , comparable with the incidence that was observed from previous Thi@@ omer@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination doses were administered in a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ ot@@ ers at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans of combination @-@ sim@@ ulating material .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matter on a calculation base per vacc@@ ination ambi@@ ence Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
after the complete vacc@@ ination of 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who received the ambient rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the frequency of Mat@@ ency was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination with 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received ambient temperature compared to 3@@ 6.2 % compared to the subjects who received 3 @-@ doses combined material ) .
the incidence of prec@@ ari@@ ous pain and sensitivity was small and comparable to the administration of the combination @-@ sim@@ ulated dosage with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a comparative study with 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old imp@@ fl@@ ingen the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and gener@@ ational actions occurred in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , in the 6- until 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ mo .
the percentage of imports that character@@ ise severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen reported was statistically significant .
in clinical trials , which were carried out in Imp@@ act at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the power rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV was 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose , and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
ser@@ oc@@ cult rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 @-@ administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study carried out by 12- to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined @-@ material with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was in@@ valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose antibody .
the immun@@ o@@ deficiency that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year olds reached a month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , imports were either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ologic reaction against both antibodies was similar to vacc@@ ination with a combination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12- to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
if the first dose of ambi@@ rix , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b @-@ vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ vacc@@ ines , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this present formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational and ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ger rates as for the former formulation .
the vaccine is to be studied both before and after res@@ us@@ ks on any other external particles and / or physical changes .

the hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al foods and beverages , but may also be transferred by other ways , such as through Baden in through the waters @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a bl@@ ender face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not entirely protecting from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you have not yet feel at the vaccine time or feel sick / feel ) a vaccine may not be avoided .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
allergic reaction can be caused by ju@@ icy skin attacks , breathing not or sul@@ fur from the fac@@ ial or tongue . • If your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with a fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the requested administration of the second vaccine ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ination with a reduced salary of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface material ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vacc@@ ination with reduced salary is usually administered one month after the first dose , and may give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected at heavy bleeding problems , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child moves a ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people on the vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on the vacc@@ ination .
21 Do you receive your doctor if you receive / or receive additional medic@@ inal medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ption ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ption , or if you have been vacc@@ inated with Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is in@@ sufficient on the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
when another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and as possible as possible different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , ambi@@ valent or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except it is ur@@ gently required that they will be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction on Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second im@@ itation , please contact your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval of the market , CH@@ MP grants the opinion that the value @-@ risk rate for the Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , there are only one member state in the Netherlands since May 2003 ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to small patient exposure .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with full enzyme in@@ firm@@ ament or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium mixer ( brain in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity as a result of high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentrations ) .
ammon@@ aps - split into several single doses to meals - swallowed , put under the food or mixed with a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a nose onde ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a comparable study , because ammon@@ us could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ agent , i.e. , without drug ) .
in addition , ammon@@ et can also result in loss of loss in blood , depression , stim@@ ul@@ sions , head@@ ache , imp@@ ot@@ ence , di@@ lution , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , r@@ att@@ ening , r@@ att@@ aching , sen@@ sel@@ ess body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ qu@@ or prevented from patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values .
ammon@@ et was approved under an extraordinary circumstances because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme known as new@@ born ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with late @-@ manipul@@ ative form ( in@@ complete enzyme disorder that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first age of life ) , there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ p disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into consideration the protein tolerance and the required daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
for patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ger bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate lack must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to si@@ p disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets will not be immediately on the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used to treat patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ oid in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ at@@ ric and eco @-@ formation .
as met@@ abolic and removal of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is thus con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal losses and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve charges in the brain and thereby a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted during the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during a stand@@ still is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year @-@ old pre @-@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with L@@ act@@ at@@ azi@@ onale , severe hypo@@ cris@@ ty , arm@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atic itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred within a 5 month old baby @-@ child with an average single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ ed neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ ab@@ oli@@ stic connection , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by ac@@ et@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
hem@@ og@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen compounds ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative holder for the removal of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of gen@@ om@@ ic sodium phen@@ yl@@ b@@ yl@@ ates between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the forecast of early @-@ breaking form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always infectious , and the disease led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their st@@ ick@@ ed @-@ free An@@ al@@ oga in the first year of life .
by ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen dioxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , protein reduced and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ated diseases in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with the time with many of mental disabilities or other neu@@ rolo@@ gic deficit .
in patients with a late form of the disease ( including female patient with the h@@ etero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ger bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ Man@@ age ) , which were treated from a hyper@@ os@@ om@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical deficit could also occur in treatment hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic function can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is contam@@ inated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined according to the administration of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid in an empty healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , and repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydro@@ xy@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after intake , plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were noted .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ bells , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) were det@@ ectable in plasma by no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ concentrations in the plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts .
- The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium hydro@@ xy@@ but@@ rat had no cl@@ eric doses treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or over a nose onde .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially des@@ perate amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine , and serum prot@@ ector should be held within the normal range .
for patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ger bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium hydro@@ xy@@ but@@ t , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat federal states were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active met@@ ab@@ oli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in pyr@@ am@@ ids in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain .
an likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year @-@ old pre @-@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with L@@ act@@ at@@ azi@@ onale , severe hypo@@ cris@@ ty , arm@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atic itis .
hem@@ og@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen compounds ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the de@@ position of excess pressure
on the basis of investigations about the de@@ position of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of gen@@ om@@ ic sodium phen@@ yl@@ b@@ yl@@ ates between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly noticeable in the treatment of hardly rever@@ si@@ bly , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic function can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydro@@ xy@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after intake , plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were noted .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must get the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they can &apos;t leave the nickel @-@ plated waste products , which can &apos;t be put out after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you should use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your physician or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drug .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could harm the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ence , head@@ aches , taste problems , im@@ pregn@@ ation of taste , disin@@ ori@@ enti@@ re@@ ty , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic patients were observed .
if you notice of one of these symptoms , you sit immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for purpose in connection with a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your physician or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drug .
they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric feeding ( tube , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose ( tube , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a straight edge of measuring spoon . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife @-@ g@@ aps over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • In the measuring spoon remaining amount corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container .

if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow and improve the effectiveness of a PCI .

during the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the aid of GP@@ I - for preventing new events ( deaths , heart failure or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , angi@@ ox@@ in relation to all indicators were as effective as H@@ epar@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than H@@ epar@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other parts of the other .
it must not be applied in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac disease .
the Committee for Human Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is responsible for the treatment of ACS and a PCI in an acceptable re@@ location for H@@ epar@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with approval for placing An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting colour@@ less ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) with an emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous flux of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI Express , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed after 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a suspension of 0.5 mg / kg was administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox@@ in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a large Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / weight of body should be made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medic@@ inal drug should be carefully shu@@ ff@@ ed before applying the use of the &quot; Bolshevi@@ zation . &quot;
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg incre@@ ment dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , the PCI should be treated ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inc@@ umbent rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second bar@@ us@@ dose .
in patients with moderate kidney failure , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ age adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sed patients ( see paragraph 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox@@ in can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated H@@ epar@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of Lower H@@ epar@@ in .
• Over@@ all @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other blood @-@ risk or increased blood pressure risk . • severe inflamm@@ atory hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial DNA . • severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sed patients
patients are carefully tested during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the PCI patients may occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most bleeding may occur in patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous correlation intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is in principle anywhere .
in patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Value ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) should be achieved in order to ensure that the value after ab@@ using the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will once again be reached before the treatment .
proce@@ eding from the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ epar@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants ) can be assumed that these substances increase blood pressure .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ables are regularly over@@ used in any case .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra becomes sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease when the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regul@@ ate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or process the insulin .
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human@@ kind , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work time has a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes where the insulin @-@ insulin has not been effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a 0.14 % decrease ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was 0.14 % in comparison with insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal conditions .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other parts , or in patients who already suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the A@@ pi@@ dra cans may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may impact on the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH , granted approval for the placing on the market per@@ missions by A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the scope of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin exchange , the insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced .
any change of work force , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can move a change of insulin demand .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or decline of treatment , in particular in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ; these states are potentially life threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient on another insulin type or a insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change from switching the treatment diagram .
to the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic acid , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , an@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , Fi@@ br@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ants ( MA@@ O ) Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .

animal experiments on re@@ productive activities showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ on@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ kind in relation to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if non @-@ insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ able after oral application .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection of inj@@ ections within the injection area , as a result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy in the injection area .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with awareness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a corresponding person or by intraven@@ ous aid of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose monitoring , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the primary cause of the severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels due to stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ ri@@ is@@ isation occurs faster and the effect lasts shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal conditions .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ relevant dosing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional to a proportional effect , and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glu@@ ing effect , exactly like human insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active experience as normal human@@ kind and achieves the full hydraulic effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was evident that during an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ dic@@ ular glyc@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin had been ge@@ ared for 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ dic@@ al control was reached as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ill@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned within 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control is performed like in human normal conditions , the 2 Mi@@ - n@@ ud@@ ed before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin resistance in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before beginning of the meal ) before the beginning of the meal , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 minutes ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal conditions , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after beginning of the meal ) compared to human Northern @-@ mal@@ ine , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
