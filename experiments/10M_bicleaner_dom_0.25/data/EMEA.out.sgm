<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) describes the conducted studies in order to provide recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact you to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as injector solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and talking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not available), mistrust and madness; • bipolar-I disturbance, a psychic illness, alternating the patient manic episodes (Periods) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe clinical episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural dysfunction, if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both illnesses allow the solution to insert or use the melting tablets in patients where the sip of tablets need trouble.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously detect other medicines that are used as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransitter is used to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin administered a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, giving Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of abilify, which prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was studied in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared to two trials involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that compared to an increased unrest, compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo which had been re-occur to 160 patients who have been stabilized with abilify in which the manian symptoms were stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of abilify injection solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which had to increased unrest, with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in symptoms of patients with a standard record for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also resulted in studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to insert it (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, the patients showed the abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms increased significantly as the patient who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the treatment of bipolar disorder abilify has decreased in four of five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify has also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo which had previously untreated patients with previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses must also be more effective than placebo the symptoms increased significantly and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (steamity), bunch pain, blurbation (constipation), serene hyperretion (increased splice production), tiredness and exhaustion, ruin fluid, Insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes in which the manic episodes applied to the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural troubles in patients with schizophrenia or patients with chronic episodes at bipolar-I disturbance, if an oral therapy is not suitable for over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted authorization to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing the transportation of abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of smooth-severe episodes of bipolar-ion disturbance and for the prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar cells of patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affecting disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even with treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicides in patients with bipolar disorder associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemia diseases, condensation disorder), fragmentation (didehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure glaucoma or hypertension (including acute and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were reports of reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treated with ABILIFY occur signs and symptoms of a late dynasty, should be moved into consideration, to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If the patient signs of signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever, without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aripiprazol should therefore be used with cramp crashes in the anamnese or at states that are associated with cramp crashes, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted rovascular events in treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoitinerary or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic pharmaceutical ingredients including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic ingredients treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipits, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness, patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used for schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotica when weight gain is known as adverse effects and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is caution when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centralized medicines with side effects such as marine dation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol at 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result in the common application with highly effective Inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should not exceed potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">Depending on the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilemazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be applied to an even increase in Aripionzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol has no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodxyinan ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to alert their doctor, when pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base in humans and due to the inproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk of redness.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under Placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol reported a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acathery, Dystony and dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperil (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another long-term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olantic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was among patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long period of long period, more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study showed the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo experienced significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increase in CPK (creatine-phosphoase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, was observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol in comparison to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Regarding the adverse events that occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptosis syndrome, spätdyskinesis and cramp failures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or unintentional overdose with Aripiprazol was observed alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the effectiveness of a hamodialysis with the treatment of an overdose associated with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely that hamodialysis of an overdose of benefits, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma measurement.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol at schizophrenia and bipolar-I interruption in the combination of a partial-agonist effect on dopamine D2- and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adore and to the Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the Positric emissions tomography showed a dossient reducing the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor co-ligor, at Nucleus caudatus and at the Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week 52 in a semi-controlled study, 52 was the proportion of the response of patients receiving a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depression rates, showed a significantly more stronger than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction of the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and 57% among the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantern controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance showed no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and an exhausting effect that was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I interruption, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, Aripiprazol showed a remission compared to placebo over the prevention of a bipolar recovery, mainly for the prevention of a bipolar recovery.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxydeformation of Aripiprazol. CYP3A4 has been catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminational period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and close to 146 hours with 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, and showed no gender-dependent effects in pharmacokinetic study.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no reference to clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the impact of the room on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokactic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull impacts on their metabolic capacities.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, Reproductive haricity, Genotoxicity and the canogens have no particular hazards to the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of human subjects, therefore limited to clinical use only limited or no importance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dossior-sensitive secondary pigments (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of human being (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of human rats at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the middle steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelixasis was found as a result of the failure of sulphate conjugate of Aripiprazol in accordance with repeated oral gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gene, the concentrations of sulfate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol found no more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study for 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed in rabbits, which led to exposure of 3- and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="299">Pain in the chest pain, weakness of musculature, muscular pain, muscle tissue, pain pains, pain in the skeletal musculature, flange pain, discomfort in the alleges, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Ruhelofication 1 The frequency of the excessive relation actions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no colonic connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubine substance that promotes the storage of microtubules from tubullets and stabilized the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the otic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates the transzytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in vitro studies was proved that the presence of albumin the transport of Paclitaxel is supported by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport by the gp-60-albuminor is conveyed and due to the albumen protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) is a Paclitaxel accumulation within the range of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-blind studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapyaxel of 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without prescription (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metasteries.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received any chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus Paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived in an peripheral neuropathy degree 3, evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the total Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions from Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Expressors (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration increased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a far-reaching exproprietary distribution and / or female connection of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced tumours, the pharmacokactic characteristics of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 ablraxane compared with a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 soluble Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The paclitaxel Clearance was higher (43%) after a solvent free Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue stories it is reported that Paclitaxel is in first line to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metal levels (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) is metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the average amount of 4% of the total dose associated with less than 1% of the metabolism amounts to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, over patients at the age of more than 75 years, however, only few data are available, because only 3 patients of this age group included in pharmacokic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light green light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseam is similar to organic medicines that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference ring").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal bleeding problems, where associated with a blood transfusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible, and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seageing must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blazing flake, Abseam is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care officer, provided that they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney insufficiency in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemogbells should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decahites in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is made, and iron ore supplements should be given during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, a anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency, or that the body does not adequately stimulate the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin will also use operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was transferred to the formation of epoxin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed became an injection in a vein in the context of a primary study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by cardioid problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo had been injected before being transferred either to Abseam or continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hemogbells between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of under the skin were speckled with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients treated at Abseam were in the same degree as in those patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients receiving Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12,0 g / l.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse effect of Abseam is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steching migraine and turbulation.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against epoxin alfa or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Demolition under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, since other studies are required to ensure that by no allergic reactions are caused.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the medicine was initiated as a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which represents Abseam, will provide information on the medical professionals in all Member States, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients who should lie the hemoglobin concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anesymptome and follicities may vary depending on the age, gender and overall disease load; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemogbells by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">On the basis of the variability between patients, individual hemogbells in patients can occasionally be observed or under the hemogbells target.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemogbells, the hemoglobin target should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / l (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemogbells rise by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month, or if the durable hemoglobbance value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored continuously, in order to ensure that epoxin alfa is required in the lowest approved dose that is necessary for controlling the anaemia and anaymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher power outlets as patients where initial anemia may be less distinct (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher power outlets as patients where initial anemia may be less distinct (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 mg / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 mg / kg (three times a week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anesymptome and - follow-up may vary depending on the age, gender and overall disease load; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemogbells, the hemoglobin target should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / l (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored continuously, in order to ensure that epoxin alfa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for checking the anesymptome.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemogbells, at least 1 g / l (0.62 mmol / l) or the reagent count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 mg / kg should be retained for three times a week or 450 mg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemogbells rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reagent number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 mg / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If following 4 treatment weeks of 300 mg / kg three times per week the hemogbells value of ≥ 1 g / l (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reagent number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl has increased, should be retained three times a week times per week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemogbells value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reagent number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoxin alfa therapy is probably unlikely and the treatment should be demolished.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with light anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-sufficient storage of ≥ 4 blood conservatives should be required, the seageing should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of autologous blood-endeavable program - as early as several weeks before the start of the autologous blood-endeavable program - so that before the start of the detachting therapy large iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg epetnalfa, which should be given once weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">During this, epoxin alfa should be preoperatively 300 mg / kg each on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of the dialysis about the hose of a fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml isotonic cooking salt, to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients receiving treatment with some erythropoetin on a erythroblastopenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seperate or other heigropoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenia).</seg>

<seg id="413">Data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use in patients with a risk of anti-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic kidney insufficiency should not be exceeded in accordance with Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased risk of risk and risk of serious cardiovascular disease were observed, when Erythropoese stimulating substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of epoxetines if the hemoglobin concentration of blood transfusions and avoidance of blood transfusions is increased.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemogbells rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney insufficiency and clinically evidence-coronarer hereditary insufficiency should not be exceeded in Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present insights, the treatment of anemia with epoxinalfa in adults with kidney insufficiency, which are not yet dialysed, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">Avastin is supposed to be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epetin alfa 2 - 3-week delay between epoxin alfa gift and the Erythropoetin response (patients who may have to be transmissible).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month, or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical-treated anaemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemogbells value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction under involvement in the respective patients who should consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of epoxin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and correspondingly treated.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective therapy prophylaxis, as it should have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases particularly in case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded, that treatment with epoxin alfa for patients with a starting signal value of &gt; 13 g / dl could pass an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most common adverse events during the treatment with epetinalfa is a dossior increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovasculous events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of the Erythropoetin treatment it is possible to occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease according to frequent blood supply to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically produced epetin alfa is glycemulated and of the amino acids and carbohydrates of carbohydrates, with the endogenous human erythropoetine, which was isolated from Urin anemia patients.</seg>

<seg id="592">Following a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission of patients was observed in patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient amount of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after Aclasta's gift (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently non-traumatic hilate, a initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 i.e. orbitor intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the gift of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function interference (see paragraph 4.4) When patients with a Kreatinine cleance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended because a limited clinical experiences for these patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio availability, distribution and elimination with older patients seem similar to younger.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because data are missing and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney insufficiency (creatinine cleance &lt; 35 ml / min) because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">A preexisting mortal anaemia is pre-treated with Aclasta due to adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid integration of the effect of Zoledronic acid on the bone structure a temporary, with symptomatic hypokalzemia, their maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient amount of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after Aclasta's gift (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Kidney function Zoledronic acid has been associated with kidney dysfunction, which is used as a decline of the kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum-creatinins) and rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The alteration of the Creatinine cleance (measured before the administration) and the appearance of kidney failure and a limited renal function were similar to osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum-creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory studies, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were treated below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l), which were treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study patients compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients were complementary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical freight rates and morphing studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely investigated, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported beyond local reactions to the infusion of jurisdiction, such as Roman, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosen in the orthodontic, especially in cancer patients, about osteonekrosen (primary in the orthodontics) reported that with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid, were treated.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had evidence for local infections, including osteoporosis, and the majority of the reports refers to cancer extracts or other dental surgery.</seg>

<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric body fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebrates (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had reduced the risk of vertebrates compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on strokes Aclasta pointed out a remaining effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced rate of 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hilate.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on the bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density on the lumbrance, hips and the distal radius compared to placebo (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>

<seg id="627">Frachistology At 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic diseases were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase of the traverscular bone volume in comparison to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone marker marker The bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeller (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum samples were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months compared to initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were measured as routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 i.e. oral or intramuscularly) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta group, compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD in total threadings and scarves for all periods.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% at the total thigh and 4.3% at the closing price.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised, and in 185 patients the BMD was judged after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (survey CZOL446M2308), the once weekly dosing was covered by Aclasta in comparison to the percentage change of the lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed morbus Paget the bone (middle serum mirror of alkaline phosphate according to the 2.6fold-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to taking 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decline of pain intensity and pain was observed after 6 months in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responsibilities at the end of the six-month study (on the therapy only) could be recorded in a follow-up period.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response of 141 of those with Aclasta, compared with 71 who treated with Risedronate patients, are maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous infusions from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokineetic data that proved to be dossierous.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma concentration rapidly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Raschal biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-half times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long Eliminational phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β) represent the quick resorption in the bones and the deposition on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no impact on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized because it is not metabolized or not a direct or no direct and / or irreversible inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatine Clearance, and mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function cut down to a creatinine Clearance up to 35 ml / min not require dose adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of heavy kidney function (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted data are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC) have the 6fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, total 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application with repeated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as to the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common study of studies with repeated application was a multi primary primary sponsoring in the metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dosages, a fund who reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed teratogenicity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum samples.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) describes the conducted studies in order to reach recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • In particular, patients (monotherapeutical medicine) can be applied in (particularly overweight patients). • It can be applied together with other diabetic medication (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), metformin alone can not be adjusted with Metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnsweetener or insulin, the previous dose of sulphuylharnstoffs or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Acrate treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of the sulotylharnstoffs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-owned insulin can be utilized better and the blood sugar level drops, which means that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphuylharp, in addition they received either account or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glykosy hemoglobin, HbA1c) showed how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease of the HbA1c value, which means that the blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with Metformin and a sulphuylharnant showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin, compared with 0.14% compared to 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who participated in the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper breaths (cold conditions), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity compared to maturation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used to treat patients (allergic) versus Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoia (high level of mirror - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment in patients as an alternative to standard treatment of metformin in patients where Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited permit an approval from Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, circular, curved and wear on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin-in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate due to contraindications or incompatibilities (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) are at risk to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eyelids, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and eyelids being monitored if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrophicular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard unit) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range, the liver values are as soon as possible, as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as impulatory nausea, vomiting, harmonic problems, tiredness, appetite and / or dark harn are to check the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazon should be continued until the predators of the laboratory parameters should be directed by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dossient weight gain has been detected, which can stir in fat deposits and connected in some cases with liquid resistance.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodiac disease, a minor reduction in middle hemogbells (relative reduction by 4%) and hematology (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoguclei by 3-4% and hematology (relative reduction of hemogbells by 1-2% and hematology rits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensors, the pioglitacon as oral dual or triple-combination therapy with a sulphylharnant or triple-combination therapy with insulin has received the risk of a dossidependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the launch of the treatment with thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, about an appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema reported with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödemen should be aware of a macular edema while patients could report about disruptions of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmic declaration should be considered into account.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events, regarding bone breaks from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture of the fracture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative drug treatment.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or a pregnancy, the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interaction have shown that Pioglitazone did not practice relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral counterzeptiva, Cyclosporin, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-Reducting inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrozil (cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazon by the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily due to treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulanemia in pregnancy and increased insulin-resistant to the mother's disease and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (derived from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycemic efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, ALT-accumulation conveyors over three times the upper limit of the norm range right to as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnye.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrophicular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon bzan.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely via heart insufficiency is reported under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages undesired events on bone breaks from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with piroglitazon groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years current Proactive study, freight rates were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears over an activation specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin level of liver, lids and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the Glucoscreen production in the liver and increases the peripheral gluten development in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide was continued over two years to investigate the time until leaving the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was randomised, despite three-month optimisation phase, was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean hbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to take insulin; a reduction of insulin-dose associated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatine torotiations compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited study of type 2 diabetics at 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and slightly, however, significantly increased LDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol while under Metoglitazone, while under Metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the intimidated triglyceride level, both via a effect on triglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a kardiovasculary Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macroascular disease were randomised in groups which received from an existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy in addition to Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to the oral application Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unchangeable Pioglitazon generally will be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness in about the triple the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the radioactive application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the Fäs (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than healthy subjects in patients with reduced cardioid function, whereby the rates are similar to the oral Clearance of the parent substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree on repeated oral volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily due to the treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulanemia and increased insulin-resistant to the maternity and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (in male and female rats) were induced (in male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-familiar polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of coleontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture of the fracture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative drug treatment.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatine quotiations compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober-triglycerides, but improved over a effect on tryglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in its primary endpoint loss, which resulted in combination of the total mortality, non-mortal aract syndrome, leg amputation of leg arteries, leg amputation of the leg arteries which are not associated with ingestion of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages undesired events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone, showed an increased incidence of bone breaks in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was used in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">After 12 weeks, the concentration of a substance (glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human infection.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used for patients who may react sensitively (allergic reactions) to humankind (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane must be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be selected to blood sugar (the full list is available to the package).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane should not exceed the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S Commission for the Intradeshow of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily, if a fast initial effect can be wished with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection needle has to be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels has improved considerably through a intensified insulin-therapy, the hypoglycaemia hazard symptom can be perceived and should therefore be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-effective insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin-dependent) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin-animal origin) can result in a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If switching to Actraphane in patients a dose adaptation is necessary, it may be necessary for the first dosage, or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who appeared hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal in human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia was less pronounced or differently compared to their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling through several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician, as such travels allow insulin and meals to be taken or taken during meals at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore must take into consideration possible interactions during the therapy and to inquire its patients with others after other drugs.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 As for hypoglycaemia, hyperglycemia which occur in a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemics can lead to consciousness and / or cramp crashes, with temporary or lasting disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Conditions of the Nervous System Yellow - peripheral neuropathy a rapid improvement of blood glucose monitoring can be associated with complaints, which are referred to as acute painful Neuropathy and normally reversibly.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. intensification of the insulin-therapy with a rupted improvement of blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Illnesses of the skin and the underhauled money - lipodystrophy in the injection area can cause a lipodystrophy, when failed to change deposits within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General diseases and complaints in the administration location Geleg. - Local inter-sensitive reaction on the injection area During the insulin-therapy may occur local supersensity actions (Rössing, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection point).</seg>

<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage; representations of the formulation or regime should only be made under the engaging control of a medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups Patients with reduced liver function In the feeding area can be necessary for patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials from Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of cardioid function (including a regular determination of the serum Creatininspiegel, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin on request when switching from a Ciclosporin- based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is subjected to caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct common controls of the Tacrolimus-Talsi during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-talks about tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from prodigf to Advagraf, dose adjustments, changes of immune-corrosive therapy or to concurrent use of substances which could change the Tacerilimus Full Control Concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advance a drug with a low Clearance is the adjustment of the dose may require multiple days until steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the level of the valley is not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley mirror of Tacrolimus in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent placement of liver, kidney disease and cardiac disease were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events, including transplants, or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus sub-or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage; representations of the formulation or regime should only be made under the engaging control of a medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of growing patients with graft reactions, which proved to be treated with other immune agents than refractory therapistent, no clinical data for the retardated formulation were found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In addition to the prophylaxis of transplant grafts and transplants in child transplants, no clinical data for the retardated formulation were found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a downturn of tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of plant extracts, the Johanniskraut (hypericum puncture), or other plant belts during a treatment with supplementation (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood has been offered since the Tacrolimus Blood levels may be subjected to serious fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a chamber or septum hypertrophy had been observed in rare cases, which therefore can therefore occur under the agraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid fatigue loading and eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immune soup, the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medications, which are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing the blood values of tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended that tacrolimus- blood levels may change to monitor the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose for maintaining the same concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly distinctive interaction was associated with Antimykotica like Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibiting of gastrointestinal defects, results.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly sensitive prednisolone or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute disgusting actions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism may deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus degraded the clearing of steroid contraceptiva and thus increase the hormone exposure, especially cautious measures can be cautiously recommended by decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potential the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application is after that the treatment is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of blood cells in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is manufactured according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which one gene has been incorporated into the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, which is similar, but it does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of blood cells and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood periods were awarded "or" well. "</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be applied in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against human existence factor VIII, mash or hamster protein or one of other parts.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval of Baxter AG to take a approval for the Intake of Advance in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: the dosage and duration of the substitution is based on the severity of factor VIII of the defect, following the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hämorrhagic events, factor VIII activity is not to fall below the stated plasma bars (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of patients is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, a reasonable dose and frequency of injections is caused by a reasonable determination of factor VIII-plasma screens.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and feature different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention of prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis by patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII non-Plasmaactivities does not reach or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to verify an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII of VIII is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures will be affected.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed should be carried out after testing the patient, whereby a maximum injector rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is well-known aclication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>

<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 expositions is at the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnesty-known inhibitory development was observed, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the repealed of (lowjob) inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has also been evaluating the benefit-risk wrestation as a positive rating, but in account that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of safety profile from ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months required to apply for the approval of approval in 5 years another renewal process.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Rights Powers (CHMP) officially announced that the company receives its application for approval by Advexin for the treatment of Mr. Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">But usually the breast, the brain, the bones or the skin parts (tissues, the other structures in the body, surrounds and backs) are affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that was genetically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus," which has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves, and thus could not trigger the infections of the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1644">In fact, Advexin would be injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from which is not defective in the human body-existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work correctly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study with one patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of sub-building, in the bone and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">In accordance with CHMP the answers from the company had examined questions, still some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial documentation, the CHMP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP view, the injections of the exexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors has not been demonstrated in response to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had respect concerning the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven enough that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way, that it is neither for the environment nor for people who are in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company set the CHMP not having regard to whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered mode release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinium is used for treating symptoms of seasonal Rhinitis (hayloft, caused by allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal mucuous membranes (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents ages 12, the recommended dose of Aerinium is twice daily one tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (hidden nose) are denied.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main memory measurements were the changes in the severity of the hayloft symptoms that were reported from the patient prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients contributed their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, such as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the hayloft symptoms besides the constipation of the nose reported the patients receiving aeronauaze revenues, over a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the threshold of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving the Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, irrigation, dizziness, mental stress, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (insomnia), insomnia (insomnia), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used to treat patients suffering from desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenerge active ingredients or Loratadin (another drugs for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeronautics may also be applied in patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), or hyperthyroid (overfunction of thyroid) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk for haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission announced that SP Europe granted approval for the public transport of aeronautics in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow up in the whole (i.e., without scratches or cut off).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to the failure of data on the failure and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after crossing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can take off.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of the mucous membrane in the upper breaths, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze's pseudoephedrin contains the medicine also contrasted in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined application of pseudoephedrin, Pergolid, Lisboid, Cabergolin, ergonomotamine, dihydroergamine or other deformation (phenylpropanolamine, phenyl lephrin, ephedrin, Oxygen, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient-design, and the data are not sufficient to cover corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aeronautics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disturbing and the data are not sufficient to cover corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or tachycardiac or of Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptomatic (such as headaches or a reinforcement of headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of following patient groups to be careful: • Patients under DIGITALIS • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder problems or bronchospital in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze can remove at least 48 hours prior to carrying out dermatological tests as antihistamine otherwise may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their degree.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadine, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole, however, no clinical-relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychedelic tests no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadine and the placebo had been detected, irrespective of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified, so that interaction with other drugs can't be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibitions in vivo CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The disorder of the application of aeronauaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison with normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of vascular properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients, however, should be clarified, that in very rare cases, it may occur in very rare cases to lead the traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms vary between a CNS depression (consolidation, apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapps) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treads, convulsions) with possible lettuals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, deteriorate microscope, Euphoria, stimulation, respiratory disturbances, heart rhythms, tanning, nausea, vomiting, precorrosive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, Ataxy, optic nerve function and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely to be the same as Atropin-Typical Symptoms (mouth-drying, pupanarre and - dilemation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">They exclude the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human ematcells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of expression of the adhesion smolecular P-seless to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flight power including the amplification of subjective sentiveness or the tasks associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of smeats in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage may produce more sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, tachometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhinitis with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminant efficacy of aeronauaze tablets, determined using the total score for the symptom (except nasal sskin swelling) significantly higher than under one monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aeronauaze tablets with regard to the weakening effect, determines from the nasal skin swelling was significantly higher than a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aeronautics tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose of a single dose for pharmacokinetics by Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of an pharmacokinetist multi-cycle study conducted with formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects was found that four subjects desloratadin was found badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components study study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrin was the exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for security harmacology, for toxicity a repetitive gift, to Genotoxicity and for reproductive oxicity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadine does not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects of the effects were generally consistent with pseudoxephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-fiction studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudo ephedra was inhalved in the oral gift of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbit in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal Rhinitis and two trials involving asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadranch, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to verify that the body uses the syrup solution, the solution to insert and use the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application for children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">For allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius received an average decline of symptom scores (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urtikaria, the decrease of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients, possibly sensitive to desloratadine, Loratadine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission announced that SP Europe granted approval for placing on the market permissions of Aerius, throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to prevent symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergischer rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials to the efficacy of desloratadine for juveniles from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be completed according to the previous disease and can be resumed after the symptoms of symptoms and when repealed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Due to the persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended in the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, Aerius and alcohol is not reinforced with the benefit of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients, however, should be clarified in very rare cases, that it may result in very rare cases to use inactivity or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius, as in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently recalled side effects that was reported more frequently than in placebo had tiredness (1,2%), oral cavity (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common balance of headache, that occurred in 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin and treated with placebo in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study where up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose) were given, no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human power cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of expression of the Adopolieküls P seless to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple sclerosis, in which Desloratadine was administered over a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">For a single dossi- study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight power including the amplification of subjective sentiveness or the tasks associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in the reduction of symptoms such as nibroom, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and rocking of eyes as well as juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the total score of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the treatment by seasonally allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was deputy chief for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying Pathophysiology, regardless of the aetiology, is quite prospective to different forms and chronic patients become easier.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the contamination of a causal factor in all urticularial diseases is expected that Desloratadin is expected to carry out in other forms of urticaria for an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the ratio of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine treatment in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistaminics were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching yield by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and the wax significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In an pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal Rhinitis population, a higher concentration of Desloratadine was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no basis points for a clinical-relevant Kumulation after once daily application by Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified, so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo and not CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossiac study involving Desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetal, calorie-rich breakfast) is not based on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out by Desloratadine and Loratadin showed a comparably degree of exposure of Desloratadine, no quality or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity project of Desloratadine and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies for security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and for reproductive elasticity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin will not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Color-coloured film (includes Lactose-Monohydrat, Hypromless, Titanium dioxide, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromless, Macrogol 400), Carnauba wax, lightweight wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals using allergic rhinitis in allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergischer rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age caused by an infection (see below section 4.4) and that no data is based on the treatment of an infectious rhinitis with aserius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper breaths or anatomical anomalies should play anamnese, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin studies playing a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desloratadine and experienced a higher substance load (see below paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years of age related to metabolize is identical to children who metabolize the normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorptioning or sucrose-insufficiency this medication should not take away.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, Aerius tablets and alcohol is not further strengthened with the benefit of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall threading of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius, when patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11, who arrived for anti-histamine therapy, received a daily Desloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, applied in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially dealt with the Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) that the company receives its application for approval from Aflunov to the prevention of aviaries H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect the flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which may cause a strain of flu virus, which may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic will break when a new tribe of flu virus appears that easy to spread from man to human beings, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus during the vaccine, and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form a fast antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-strange), has been cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">One inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "Good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thereby, the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA (EMEA) vaccines requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you want to participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as solution for insertion, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Cargenerase should be prescribed only if the doctor has checked, which has previously taken antiviral medicines of the patient before, and the likelihood is that the virus will appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, taken with 100 mg of itonavr and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agase according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agase reduces the HIV-amount in blood in combination with other antiviral drug drugs and holds them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure AIDS, but can cause damage to the immune system, so that the development of associated infections and diseases are delayed.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously not treated with Protective inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine acred Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenase was compared with 206 adults which previously used protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Major indexes for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV (virusload) or the change in virusload after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but Agenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also decreased the virusload, but with the children who had been treated with protease inhibitor, only very few in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who were previously treated with protease inhibitors, the virusload increased the virusload after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant against four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenase with Ritonavir for a stronger decline of the virusload after four weeks when compared to patients who continue their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against ambabor or other parts of the other.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also be applied in patients, the Johanniskraut (a herbal preparation for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products that are just like cargenera and should be harmful in high concentrations in blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV patients suffering from HIV infections, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (abdie of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection that can be caused by a relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging of aging in combination with other antiretroviral drug to treat patients with protease inhibitor previously untreated HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In general, Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokactic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee established that the benefit of aging in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have any protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to adopt the general public transport of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aging is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually act capsules can be administered to pharmacokinetic boosting of ambabor together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambabor should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance patterns and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambavir is a solution to take 14% less than Ambabor as a capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable for a milligram per milligram basis (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Ambabor twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Ritonavr or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Cargenera is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the failure of data on the failure and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokactic data, the dose to Agenase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function reduces from 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be achieved in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-trained (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other Glukokorticoids are not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment is associated with the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including morphing Cushing and support of epidiaries function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the reinforcement of the HMG Coa-Reductase Hemmer Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenyltoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients receiving this medicine at the same time, Agenase can be less effective due to reduced plasma bricks of ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contrasts can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with ambulation, patients should therefore be monitored on ophobic symptoms, especially if there are still very low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity in relation to the high propeller content of the Agenase solution, this formulation is convened in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Phase 5 should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membrane are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received anti-retroviral therapy, including protease inhibitor, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an Exacity of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In Hämophile patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematology and hemogthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of introduction, HIV-infected patients suffering from antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop inflammatory reaction on asymptomatic or residuous opportunistic infections which leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorle etiology is assumed (including the application of Kortikosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunotherapy, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteoekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low-therapeutic width of agulation with Ritonavir may not be given together with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly exchanged via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC of Ambabor which can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable side effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum puncture) The serum mirror of Ambabor can be decreased by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already acquired Johanniskraut, the ambavirreversible level and, if possible, remove the viral load and remove the Johanniskraut.</seg>

<seg id="1966">508% increase, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Ambabor were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, showing efficacy and discomfort of this treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="1968">At 52%, Amboavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) have been achieved, approximately 40 to 50% lower than ambabor (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring, because the effectiveness and unfit of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for use of agase in combination with dithankin, but is recommended due to the antitazides component of dithankin, however, the revenues of didanosin and agase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambabor (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) does not require dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Egreavency in combination with ambabor and Saquinavir is not recommended because the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data allow Nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, be careful because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma cells.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this drug will be applied together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out because an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambavir and Ritonavir is difficult to Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambabor and Rikulutin resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration of up to 193% and thereby resulting in an increase in effects associated with Rifutin side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifutin will incur together with agase, becomes at least half of the recommended dose in at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokineetic studies with Agenase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both pharmaceuticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Ketoconazole once daily lead to an increase of Cetoconazole in plasma to 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day, without simultaneous use of Fosamphavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied to interactions together with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions associated with these drugs, if they are used in combination with agase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as a general meeting, as it can occur in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva who are known as an enzyme (phenyltoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepine), with ambabor can lead to an abiliation of the plasma beams of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calciumkanalblocks such as Amlodipine, diodiazem, Felodipine, Nijpin, Nifedipin, Niodipine, Niscpin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by ambabor, thereby reducing the activity and toxicity of this medication.</seg>

<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were obtained twice daily with 50 µg of fluorine propionat intranasal (4 times daily), while endogenous Kortisol decreased about 86% (90% interval interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenase with Ritonavir is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment is associated with the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-Coa-Reducase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose ingredients are strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma beams with the simultaneous administration of Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmapies increases this HMG Coa Reducase inhibitors to Myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations except for stabilization of mirrors, since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the same gift of ambabor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be used together with oral Midazolam (see section 4.3), while simultaneous use of a cargenera Midazolam caution applies.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Midazolam by 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amboavir, patients should therefore be monitored on ophobic symptoms, especially if there are still very low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se of historical comparability of historical comparability, no recommendation is to be given, as the ambulation dose is administered when Ambabor is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agase, an increased inspection of INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of a weakening or gain of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptiva is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods are recommended to contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse events of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous gift of asoning (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2002">The further development of imperfecting, including fermentation and reproduction, was not impaired by the administration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The disorder of Agenase was investigated in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were mild to moderately distinct, occurred early and led seldom to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are associated with the intake of agase or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of grating disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events are made from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protease of pre-treated patients 1200 mg Agenase had received twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), used by the examining doctors related to study medications and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well under the treatment of severe laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV-patients, including an losses of peripheral and natural fat tissue, multilayer intraoral and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorssovikite fatty acids (jacks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not previously untreated, who were treated with amidvir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bulky) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, with 245 NRTIs the patients treated under Ambabor 7 cases (3%) in comparison to 27 cases (11%) among 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>

<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors such as HIV-disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of introduction, HIV-infected patients suffering from antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop inflammatory reaction on asymptomatic or residuous opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients treated with PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg Agenase twice daily, were similar and incidence of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed among all aspects of triglyceride and CPK values, which received Agenase in patients with low-controlled Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is observed in the signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambabor binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the procure viral and gag-pol- polyproteination levels with the result of a formation of non-infectious Viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronic lymphobic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitors (IC50) of ambabor is in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM of acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambabor against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication during people is not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamphavir / Ritonavir metallions were observed - as with other Ritonavir related treatment schemes - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not previously untreated patients who received 700mg of Potosamphavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virologically occurred up to week 48 with 14 isolates genotypical.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolates from 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure within the 59 were included in patients with protesters and did not show resistance patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and of its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamphavir twice daily: n = 107) to patients with protease inhibitors, patients with four-controlled trials over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors are on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypical interpretations systems can be used to estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamphavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamphavir / Ritonavir defines resistance than the presence of the mutations V32I + 147A / M / M / W, I54A / L / M / W, I54A / L / M / G, I54A / L / M / G, I54A / L / M / G, I54A / L / M / G, I84V and L90M with reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to attract the current interpretations for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on photypic resistance tests, clinically validated clinical interpretations can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for the estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamphavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypical Cut-offs (separators) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against ambabor associated genetic patterns creates a certain clopeachment against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistant between ambabor and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fosamphavir resistance fighters, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretroviral not previously untreated patients, indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insets), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insets), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and tipavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambabor retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor of isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early slump of an accidental therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders, which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of agulation in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study (Virusload ≥ 1000 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-controlled Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">A hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis determined the non-submission of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI Group with regard to the time-adjusted average changes from the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma up to 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unborn chase is based on two uncontrolled trials with altogether 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution was found three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given a low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of which together with Agenase received NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml of median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered for the treatment of an unexpected benefit with PI in the expected benefit of "ungebooking" Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average length (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambabor is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ambabor (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambabor 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food absorption, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution of manifolds is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves ambabor from the blood circulation system to the fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the field in plasma, with the amount of unbound ambulation which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound ambulation remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients varies in the steady concentration in the steady-State over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs, the CYP3A4 inducing or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4, be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with agase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily ambabor exposure such as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambabor is from the solution 14% less bioavailable as out of the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and cargenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir negligible, therefore, the effect of a renal function disturb the elimination of Ambabor and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatments schematics comparable to ambabor plasma sensors comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambabor twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with ambulation with ambulation of mice and rats appeared in male animals benigne hepatoma cell Adenome at doses, which were detonated twice (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoma cells and carcinomas was not yet explained and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present study data on humans, both clinical trials and the therapeutic application, however, stated little notes for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse Mutational tests (Ames-Test), microcore test of rats and chromosome aberrations contained in human peripheral lymphocytes was ambabor neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphate bladder.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles that were treated from an age of 4 days showed both in the controls and with ambabor treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly reduced (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymol ongation and minor skeleton changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase have applied without the addition of Ritonavir (booklets), higher doses must be applied to astoase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for agase capsules amounts to 20 mg Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Ambabor that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should cause patients with slow or light liver function disturb with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-trained (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medications that can cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenyltoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards Ratio), methods for the determination of the concentration of pharmaceutical concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Act is set to be set on a period of 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membrane are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with pharmaceutical and dependent factors such as a longer continuous antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC of Ambabor which can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increase, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>

<seg id="2083">In case of an overdose, the patient is observed in the signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronic lymphobic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitors (IC50) of ambabor is in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM of acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Ambabor retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor of isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Allonazyme decreased the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had an ordinary liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Allonazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rarch, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion process.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardiac (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracyme may react to patients who may react strongly (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be notified every year all new information which may be known, checking and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is treated to observe aldurazyme as regards reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued the Genzyme Europe B.V., a permit for placing on the market of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology under the use of Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymes in patients with a diagnosis of bysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be carried by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other heretic metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient helps to increase every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Allonazyme for adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for those patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency is not determined, and for those patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Allonazyme may develop infusion-related reactions who are defined as every side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients continue to be monitored continuously, and infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment in which restorating equipment for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies to Laronidase are usually formed, usually within 3 months from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with care of aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience above the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, must be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipylock) to minimize the potential occurrences of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-severe infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / iriprofen can be weighed and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is considered to consider.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / iris props / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns which were exposed to Laronidase on maternity milk, it is recommended to do not feed during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were classified as infusion reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants below 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable pharmaceutical transactions associated with aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and over with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often performed in the following table after the following skins: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some cases with severe MPS-I-related involvement in the upper breaches and lungs in the prehistory there were severe reactions to, including bronchids, breaches and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions related to Aldurazyme, who were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe displacement and treatment duration up to 12 months, reported are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment with a serocon version, with a heavier displacement of patients under the age of 5 (average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early departure from the study) were detected by Radioimmunodeficiency (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients with whom it never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-body levels showed a robust reduction of GAG mirrors in the harn, while patients with high antibody titors had a variable reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low-neutral effect on the enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro which seemed to intrash the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of adverse pharmaceutical operations, even if the emergence of adverse pharmaceutical operations typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzymes is located in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrates and the preventing a further accumulation of ectivity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and is absorbed by cells into the lyqueens, the most likely above Mannosis-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients were randomized by the mean phenotype and only one patient proved the severe phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcted expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute distance in the 6-minute walking distance.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement of lung function and ability to improve in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Allonazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical-scale and absolute lung volumes increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a HepAtomic treatment of 22 (85%) of the study reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of GAG-Spiegel in Harn (µg / mg. of Kreatine) was found until the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous health manifestation between the patients, which has been taken into account by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes for five efficacy patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old Phase 2 study was conducted, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetic of Allonazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe temporal form and 4 in the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased GAG- Spiegel in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) noted after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe displacement form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with middle course form had a normal spiritual development speed whereas only limited or even any progress in cognitive performance was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into the codynamic effects of various Allonazyme metering schematics were performed on the GAG mirror in the harn, liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage ema with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be demonstrated in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, an appropriate alternative; however, it is not proven that long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schematics is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, non-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18, because there are not enough data regarding effectiveness and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, orlistat is only minimally resorated, is necessary for elderly and / or kidney function in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Compensitivity to the active ingredient or one of other components • Equal treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • chronic painabsorption • Pregnancy treatment (see section 4.6) • Reply treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase when alli is taken together with a low-fat single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabolic control can be used, patients who take a drug against diabetes before initiating a drug with alli to consult a physician or chemist because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who should intake alli as well as medicines for hypertension or higher cholesterol, should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage should be adjusted to this medication.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional fluctuation inctive measures in order to prevent this in case of severe diarrhoea possible failure of oral contrasts (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin was observed a decrease of the Ciclosporin plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In combination with orlistat or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values might be affected (internationally normalised ratio ratio, INR) (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the standard range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended before bedtime a supplementary multivitamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamine absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodaron was observed at a limited number of volunteers, which at the same time Orlistat received a minor decline of Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">Side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of ingenommenem fats is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of skins are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects, which were found after the launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">10. it is plausible that treatment with alli may result in terms of possible or actual astrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people, without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of those reported cases of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human beings and animal, a systemic effect on human beings and animal can be attributed to the lipasmodifying properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect puts in the lumen of stomach and upper dune by covalent bonds to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies showed that 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the food-fetch is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypothetical, fetched diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), was calculated as follows: as a variation of the body weight in the course of the course (Table 1) and as part of those students who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat was found in plasma and very low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µl) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obstructive patients who was given at least systemically resorated dose, two main metabolizes could be identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysis Lacton ring) and M3 (M1 according to the secession of the N-Formyl-Leucine Group), which were close to 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied for chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as with chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxinubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal medicine that can be used as Antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because of the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), is prevented on the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with alxi have no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with alxi were not canceled (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission announced that Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. granted approval for placing the placing on the market of Aloxi into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vomiting from nausea and vomiting chemotherapy due to cancer risk.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding one before the chemotherapy issued Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon age, patients with anamnesty reductions or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored according to the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extended the QT interval or to patients where the QT- interval is extended or extended to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides in connection with a further chemotherapeutic gift, alxi may not be used in those days after receiving chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not undergo tumours of the five investigated chemotherapies (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxinubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inductors (Doxetine, dioxin, dioxin, raoxetine, raoxetine, serine inavir, serinalin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless necessary, it is considered necessary by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most frequently observed in a dose of 250 micrograms of adverse events (altogether 633 patients), which were at least possibly with alxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensity actions and reactions in the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing report.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins were similar to adverse events such as in other dosing groups; there were no dose of action relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably does not have an effective therapy for Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, with patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-time spent 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolassetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc-intervals including the respective effects of Ondansetron and Dolassetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionenkanäle to block and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EKG effects of i.f. Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration to an initial elimination of the body with an average terminale half of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosproportionately in total dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the medium-cell patients measured in 11 testine patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokactic simulation emerges that at once daily an intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron achieved total exposure (AUC0- ∞) with which after a unique intravenous administration of 0.75 mg was measured; however, the Cmax was measured after the application of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys, and about another 50% will be converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro diagnostic studies on metabolic trials have shown that CYP2D6 and the CYP1A2 CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 being involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination According to an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the recommended dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusine projection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance, 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disturbing the terminale elimination times and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only after exposure, which are considered adequate for the maximum of human exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of the preclinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation and extend the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose was given in approximately the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of people), which have been given daily for two years, resulted in a higher frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, epidemnenmark) and skin tumors at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is determined for a unique application, the relevance of these results will be minimized for people.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the prohibiting of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A, which should be similar to the same drug, which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference ring").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Litereon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long lasting) Hepatitis C (one by a viral infection rendered liver disease).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damage increases damage, also the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which one gene has to be associated to the formation of the field.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (composition structure, composition and purity of the drug, efficiencies, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference surgeon in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were posted immediately, that data on the stability of the field and to-marketable medicines should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again in more patients than the reference ring; Alpeon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test used in the study was to evaluate the question, to what extent the medication is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with pitchers, incoming skin infection) and small ininfected blood vessels (Rissor or Schnitsunden), firing and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used for treatment of infections which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because the algo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again to investigate alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Major indexes of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of the 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-dogs Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients were treated with treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, alclogo was found that Altargo has been caused by the treatment of abstinous cavities in the body tissue) or of infections which have been demonstrated or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo passed over the short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, bevelled or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit to transfer Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients who showed no improvement in these within two to three days are supposed to be considered and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensizing or severe local irritation caused by the application of retapamulin ointment, the treatment is aborted, the sage leaves carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections which is known as Erreger or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary effects, the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections which were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment is supposed to be considered when after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which were achieved according to topical application in the poor or intact superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on the poor skin of healthy adult men around 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical use in patients can not be required if topographic Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive-elasticity according to oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement about impact on the birth and the redness / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding is continued, or the therapy with alclogo has to be completed / ended, is between the benefits of silent for the infant and the benefit of the surego therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which alargo applied, the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the administration location which was about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of effect of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s of the bacterial reef, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interaction antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bonds of ribosomal Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-ties and the Peptidyltransferasecentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to Binding to this binding place to block Pandromutiline the peptidyltransfer, block some P-bonds interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalency of resistance the application of retapamulin at least in some cases of infection, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates are sensitive to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus the presence of trunks with additional virulance factors should be considered as PVL = Panton-Valentine (like PVL = Panton-Valentine Leuencidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion daily and up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The rehearsal took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP shirts.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro-oxidative Metabolism in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low interest of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on genmutation and / or chromosome effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, respectively in cultures of human lymphocytes as well as in rats-microoidal test chromosomaler effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male impularity at female rats signs of restricted pigments with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times more exposure than the highest exposure of human being (topical application on 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study to rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development tools (reduced body weight) and delayed toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the placing on the market must make sure a pharmacovigilance system is present in Module 1.8.1 of the approval application (Version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the current product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market will be required to perform detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), and all the additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems," the updated RMP, the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated point show, you should finish the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salads, creams or cannons on the surface that has been treated with alclogo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the salads come from you on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice, if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After wearing the ointment you can cover the affected area with an sterile association or a Gazette, unless your doctor has guessed you to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in aluminium tube with a plastic bag that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in a aluminum bag that contains 0.5 g salbe.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination program, with a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only used if in immunisation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vaccination can be brought to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Ambirix or other Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine may be given if a pick-up dose may be given for hepatitis A or B.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines are involved in reducing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "alienation" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccination of Twinrix adults and has been approved in the Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix kids are given in the frame of one from three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix included identical ingredients, some of the data used by the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient temperature between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to protect antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was at a 6-month distance between injections similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetitdeficiency, pain at the injection point, redness, matness (tiredness) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient Temperature may react to patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologous s.a. granted approval for the market introduction of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the Grundimming with Ambirix consists of two vaccination outlets, with the first dose to be given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a drical vaccination is intended for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, vaccines may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovaline vaccines or with a combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis C inhibitors (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibody synthesis observed in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovaline vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether the immune-competent individuals who have found on a Hepatitis A- vaccination, as it may also be protected by immune memory by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectors of injectors, the rare case of anaphylactic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine for medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardimpfschema is recommended using the combination-quality, the 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis and persons with disruptions of the immune system, there is no sufficient supply of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-body value, so that in these cases the gift may be required for further vaccination outlets.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration may lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In cases of thrombozytopenia or bleeding problems, Ambirix can be injected as an exception subcutaneously, as it can occur in these cases according to intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injections at the same time with a combined dietary and Haemophilus type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined measur- mumps-riredness vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunotherapeutic therapy or in patients with immune defects, there must be no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccination of these formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, Matrivalitis, headaches, and fever, comparable with the incidence that was observed from previous Thiomer- and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccination doses were administered in a total of 1027 Impoters at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans of combination-simulating material.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matter on a calculation base per vaccination ambience Ambirix, but not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination of 66.4% of the subjects who received the ambient rix, about pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matency was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination with 39.6% of the subjects who received ambient temperature compared to 36.2% compared to the subjects who received 3-doses combined material).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of precarious pain and sensitivity was small and comparable to the administration of the combination-simulated dosage with the 3-cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1 to 11-year-old impflingen the occurrence of local reactions and generational actions occurred in the Ambirixgroup with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- until 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per promo.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of imports that characterise severe side effects during the 2-doses-vaccination with the combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B- surface antigen reported was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out in Impact at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the power rates for anti-HAV was 99.1% one month after the first dose, and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Seroccult rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6-administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study carried out by 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of ambirix and 147 received the standard combined-material with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was invaluable, the Seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunodeficiency that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year olds reached a month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, imports were either a 2-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunologic reaction against both antibodies was similar to vaccination with a combination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to and including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambirix, tetanus-, azellular pertussis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccines (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-vaccines, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this present formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotational and seroconger rates as for the former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be studied both before and after resusks on any other external particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix is not entirely protecting from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus (although you have not yet feel at the vaccine time or feel sick / feel) a vaccine may not be avoided.</seg>

<seg id="2782">• If your child has already an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction can be caused by juicy skin attacks, breathing not or sulfur from the facial or tongue. • If your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to a former vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a severe infection with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the requested administration of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccination with a reduced salary of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface material).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccination with reduced salary is usually administered one month after the first dose, and may give you / your child a vaccination protection against termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected at heavy bleeding problems, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you are weakened by a disease or treatment in your / its body's own defense, or if you / your child moves a hamodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these people on the vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on the vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response is insufficient on the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">When another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated on separate places and as possible as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunglobulines, it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, ambivalent or lactating women is not given, except it is urgently required that they will be vaccinated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2810">In addition, ammonet can also result in loss of loss in blood, depression, stimulsions, headache, impotence, dilution, nausea, constipation, rattening, rattaching, senseless body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonquor prevented from patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle to high ammonium values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonet was approved under an extraordinary circumstances because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme known as newborn (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with late-manipulative form (incomplete enzyme disorder that manifests itself after the first age of life), there is an indication for the use when in the anamnese exists a hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sip disorders is AMMONAPS also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into consideration the protein tolerance and the required daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetic or ornithintranger bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinate lack must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to sip disorders, as a risk for the emergence of oophagusulcera if the tablets will not be immediately on the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium hydrochloric acid, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used to treat patients with congestive heart failure or severe cardioid insufficiency as well as with sodium reatric and eco-formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolic and removal of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with liver or kidney insufficiency with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is thus contra-trained (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal losses and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve charges in the brain and thereby a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacetate is excreted during the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during a standstill is contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An likely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year-old pre-oretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with Lactatazionale, severe hypocristy, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic itis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred within a 5 month old baby-child with an average single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosed neurotoxicity at an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolistic connection, which is excreted by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Hemogchiometrically seen is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen compounds); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative holder for the removal of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genomic sodium phenylbylates between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of early-breaking form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost always infectious, and the disease led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticked-free Analoga in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hamodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen dioxide (sodium phenylacate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborated diseases in postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with the time with many of mental disabilities or other neurologic deficit.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late form of the disease (including female patient with the heterozygotes form of Ornithintranger bamylase-Manage), which were treated from a hyperosomic encephalopathy and were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficit could also occur in treatment hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurologic function can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is contaminated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to the administration of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydrochloric acid in an empty healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis, and repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium hydrochloric acid (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydroxybutyate in tablet form 15 minutes after intake, plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycles or hemogbells, phenylbutyal (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) were detectable in plasma by no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyal (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetatconcentrations in the plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">- The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, sodium hydroxybutrat had no cleric doses treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either orally (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets or patients with sip disorders) or over a nose onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially desperate amino acids), carnitine, and serum protector should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetic or ornithintranger bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per gram sodium hydrochlorate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium hydroxybutt, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat federal states were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolit of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in pyramids in the pyramids of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An likely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year-old pre-oretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with Lactatazionale, severe hypocristy, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic itis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Hemogchiometrically seen is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen compounds); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the deposition of excess pressure</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the deposition of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genomic sodium phenylbylates between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly noticeable in the treatment of hardly reversibly, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurologic function can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium hydroxybutyate in granulatform 15 minutes after intake, plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must get the medicine above a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can't leave the nickel-plated waste products, which can't be put out after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducted laboratory studies, you need to tell the doctor that you should use AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your physician or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding time, you should not take AMMONAPS, because the medicine could harm the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, turbulence, headaches, taste problems, impregnation of taste, disinorientirety, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurologic patients were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice of one of these symptoms, you sit immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for purpose in connection with a corresponding treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot the intake of AMMONAPS, take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, depression, headaches, depression, irritability, nausea, constipation, nausea, constipation, inconvenience, kidney dysfunction, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist when one of the side effects you have significantly impaired or you are aware of side effects that are not specified in this manual formation.</seg>
<seg id="2873">They are not allowed to use AMMONAPS after the change in box and the container must not be used anymore until the "stated date of expiry date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS looks and contents of the AMMONAPS tablets are welded from white colour and oval shape, and they are equipped with the "UCY 500" label.</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If you conducted laboratory studies, you need to tell the doctor that you should use AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your physician or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2877">They should take AMMONAPS with the same single doses or via a gastric feeding (tube, which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nose (tube, which is led by the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a straight edge of measuring spoon. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a knife-gaps over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess granulate. • In the measuring spoon remaining amount corresponds to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of spoons of granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angioxy is used to treat adult patients with acute coronarartifmen (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in chest basket with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (cardiac defect) without "ST- Hebdo" (abnormal measurement value at electrocardiac or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow and improve the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Close to 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS to which the effect of angiotrotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp) and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the aid of GPI - for preventing new events (deaths, heart failure or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, angioxin relation to all indicators were as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludine or other parts of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be applied in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Medical Affairs (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is responsible for the treatment of ACS and a PCI in an acceptable relocation for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd with approval for placing Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (unstable angina / non-ST-lifting colourless (IA / NSTEMI)) with an emergency access or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angioxin patients with ACS is an intravenous flux of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI Express, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed after 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a suspension of 0.5 mg / kg was administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioxin patients with a PCI consists of a initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a large Bolus gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / weight of body should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal drug should be carefully shuffed before applying the use of the "Bolshevization."</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg increment dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), the PCI should be treated (whether with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower incumbent rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second barusdose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney failure, which were included in phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without Dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney failure (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also dialysed patients (see paragraph 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angioxin can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous administration of infractionated Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of Lower Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Overall-known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other blood-risk or increased blood pressure risk. • severe inflammatory hypertension and subacute bacterial DNA. • severe kidney failure (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysed patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully tested during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulans (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the PCI patients may occur under Bivalirudine, most bleeding may occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous correlation intervention (PCI), while the treatment is in principle anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR-Value (International Standards Ratio) should be achieved in order to ensure that the value after abusing the treatment with bivalirudin will once again be reached before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Proceeding from the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytenzytenants) can be assumed that these substances increase blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrombozytenzytenants or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostables are regularly overused in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In regard to the effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the development or postnatal development are insufficient (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Onoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin Group as well as in the treatment of heparin treated similar cases, women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently used to adverse events than male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding as in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred than Bivalirudin alone less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular blood pressure, retroperitoneal, intraocular blood pressure from ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood pressure point, reduction of hemogbells in hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood-localisations observed in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" paging points, retroperitoneal, gastrous, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in patients treated with heparin treated women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently used for male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Significantly less than severe bleeding occurred than Bivalirudin significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice, and are summarized according to system organs in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment of Bivalirmudan is immediately interrupt and the patient engulously closely monitored in regard to the signs of a blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombandman, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the Anionenbinism region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The Binding of Bivalirudin in Thrombin, and thereby its effect is reversible because Thrombin turn off slowly due to the extension of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerated by the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalirudin with serum of patients, in which it was come to heparininized Thrombozytopenia / heparininduce Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no throcytes allocation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients bivalirudin shows anti-oxidation and concentration-dependent anti-oxidation effect which is assigned by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirmudin should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In an arm A of the ACUITY study, the Heparin or Enoxaparin was given to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronartic syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST heaters (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra becomes subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the thighs or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease when the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-ulisin differs very slightly from humankind, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work time has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes where the insulin-insulin has not been effective, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a 0.14% decrease (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was 0.14% in comparison with insulin-lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other parts, or in patients who already suffer from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Apidra cans may be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may impact on the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, granted approval for the placing on the market permissions by Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the scope of the abdominal ceiling, to apply or subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukonogenesis capacity and diminished insulin exchange, the insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of work force, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinc delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can move a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or decline of treatment, in particular in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazides; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient on another insulin type or a insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change from switching the treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, anopyramide, Fibramin-oxidants (MAO) Hemmer, Pentoxifylline, Propoxypha, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatheytics, such as Beta loosers, Clonidin, Guanethidin, Guanethidin, Guanethnoin, and spare the symptoms of adrenergetic counterparts or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive activities showed no differences between intra- lingonulisin and humankind in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if non-insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is resorable after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following are those cases listed in clinical trials are listed, grouped according to system organs and according to declining incidence of their account (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency on the basis of the predator data is invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and blame skin, tiredness, nervousness or tread, anxiety, unusual replacement or weakness, confusion, concentration of blood, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection of injections within the injection area, as a result of a lipodystrophy in the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with awareness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a corresponding person or by intravenous aid of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose monitoring, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the primary cause of the severe hypoglycemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels due to stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin-riisisation occurs faster and the effect lasts shorter than at hu- manem normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin-relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional to a proportional effect, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in gluing effect, exactly like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has twice as fast active experience as normal humankind and achieves the full hydraulic effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that during an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postprandicular glycemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin had been geared for 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandical control was reached as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If illinglulisin is turned within 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is performed like in human normal conditions, the 2 Mi- nuded before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin resistance in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before beginning of the meal) before the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 minutes) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal conditions, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin for a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after beginning of the meal) compared to human Northern-maline, which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
