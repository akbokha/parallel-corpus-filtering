the module &amp; preview ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views , in order to view the content of your local file system .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of the selected folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map graphical display . each item is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
on &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , while the size of a folder is specified . this way large files can be easily detected when it can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently we can view &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation the right corner is meaning@@ ful and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle , which is switched to color mode , can display either depth for the light detection of the disappearance or picture of another file pec@@ uli@@ arity like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rectangle can specify with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each feature you can define whether they are displayed at all , only if enough space is present , or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate error messages are present . Moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle below .
in case of representation algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be adher@@ ed to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be maintained . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
as the allocation of a single entry is made for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will leave . here it is possible for the label and avoi@@ ding space loss by frame always beneficial the surfaces are square . the best methods in regard to lines , columns or recur@@ sive double @-@ healing .
you can define the minimum area for a entry over the menu entry view . instead , a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry , to display that this area is actually taken by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

improved database with significantly more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ ills ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ; an open source project . that means , it is referred to the support of the En@@ dan@@ wen@@ der . you should report problems and improve options .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to make it easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu features a entry problems or desires . if you &apos;re using this link , your web browser open a page in the error code . all required information are already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developers are helping to join each other . if you wish to answer any questions about other users from &amp; digi@@ p@@ un , we wish you to answer any questions related to other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should always be able to use this language .
you can also take the digi@@ plug ; visit the homepage to get news about release versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ al ; too .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ; is the registration in the developer @-@ ma@@ iling list . guide to sign in the developer @-@ ma@@ iling list by &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; .
when you &amp; digi@@ ous ; first time you get asked where you want to specify your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folders . simply enter the folder &apos;s folder , or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , data retri@@ eved will be stored for all image files .
later you can add a lot of folders such as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will be used additionally as a Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top file , the pictures contains as a base file . no picture is changed every sub@@ folder . no image will be changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator , like this :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; thir@@ sts re@@ cur@@ sive the li@@ br@@ arian path in its whole depth . you can &apos;t connect sub@@ folders , unless it box in hidden folders . this allows you to add an in@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ ous folder . do you have to do a point before the name of the sub@@ directory .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ be@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change the album by using a random photo from the album and then use it on a folder symbol . further details can be found in section Alb@@ ums .
once you have configured the base file , you can start &amp; watch your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera so it can handle it . maybe support is based on the li@@ bra@@ f library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported miniature cameras in the menu help shell help support .
how to setup and working with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . of course , each media and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; working together .
modern digital cameras distinguish themselves through the use of Compact &amp; flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera is used as a USB mass storage device . connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras , which is a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general large files are available and transmission over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports this camera and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , that the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the screen@@ shots . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might need to see a look or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to be digi@@ ous ; is how easy to extend his functionality through the modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; through writing a small module to complement one function , when the changes came to &amp; digi@@ ous ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either switch the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + switch .
the drag and storing images works everywhere : you can attach a picture in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ders line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not available in keywords , file list , or search .
- a file selection allows you to figure out the most common to JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering at the fil@@ en@@ ame only happens if this man is shown with symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of Al@@ ben@@ Settings .

what is a digital inventory - apart from the fashion word ? there is any part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent memory . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital data management through . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photography that use &amp; digi@@ ous ; we look at the procedure for digital photo photograph@@ ers that use , convert , ass@@ ay , ass@@ ay , optim@@ ise , optim@@ ise , optimize , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale Stock Manager takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , sec@@ ures , transform , transform , and exports the content that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are provided according to your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you &apos;ll need to find many photos for longer a certain photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to store the met@@ adata both in a database as well as in image files , ensuring very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first what you need to do and know what to maintain your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be arranged somehow on your computer , whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to change sometime on a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location . if you &apos;re able to organize enough photos from your date . if you are enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you will then publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option to store the met@@ adata in the installation page of met@@ adata . if you forgot this , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by choosing the respective item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? and digi@@ p@@ un came ; give them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , since you need to select every photo key@@ word , labelling and an evaluation . of course you can choose all the pictures that will need the same attri@@ bute . you can start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s take you with key@@ word , keywords , as you can proceed with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catal@@ og@@ ised images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically add the pictures to the right place . that surro@@ unds the image within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by adding a sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are deleted by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated during the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows like different met@@ adata . this is a very coar@@ se representation as each block consists of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data features all pictures .
enough of the keywords : the next chapter refers to coating or comments using your met@@ adata about your met@@ adata .
you want to only see most of your photos just let you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographer and agencies . you &apos;re sure interested how your photos arrive .
check out this panorama at the distance . from the distance it is not even a nice panorama panorama . if you consider it , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historical period is re@@ active , you may even listen to the silence . the label therefore has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others consider the title possibly more important than the image itself is more important than the image itself . remember , the key is to transfer a story to transfer Him to help Him over the motive which moves you to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only has a label to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . if you are able to export your pictures in web galleries , then they will tell you the story so for the opening and / or the title of the web site .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities can use Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization . I &apos;m sure that a day , in the near future , you can be able to open your journeys by images with geographical information . you can also export the pictures at the reception . you can also export the pictures at the reception . you can also export the pictures by G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all amended versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description says the information contained in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onymous with author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who used the photo . if it is not w@@ ished , the name of a company or organization can be used . after that value it was saved , it should not be changed to any more . this field does not support comm@@ as nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ anc@@ er photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the car box , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onymous with vend@@ ors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who offers this photo . if the photographer has a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be shown here if the picture is a picture picture , then the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . any of this problem is a digital water@@ mark . this problem is a digital water@@ mark . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the near future there will be such a module for st@@ acking processing .

of course we &apos;re not talking about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are those who can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which have a data loss .
in order to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous CDs must be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this piece set a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you think this is in your device space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it turns out to choose the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you are just written . we use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control environment . despite this massive protection they needed through chemical ag@@ eing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
there &apos;s a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which seems to appear on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to corrupt the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to save the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non @-@ quality media . read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using this media or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ats reserve your statistics for themselves . your manufacturing guarantee include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a big field study on the error mechanism of hard drives available : dis@@ missing
in brief : dis@@ ks will keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not determine these errors . some of SM@@ ART can termin@@ ate the error . these are particularly reading points and publishing count . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to any blackout . before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally recovered without any major problems .
while most electrical devices are not much better . these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed requirements . these anom@@ ali@@ es have locked these anom@@ ali@@ es , full data loss , hardware fail@@ ings , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against currents is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest . it is normally available in the form of a connector bar . remember that no connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you &apos;re looking for a over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that he protects against bl@@ ank@@ ets and protects the correct devices .
as a over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should also consider that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage controllers , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dems and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so , they are ideal for the travelling .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system is used for smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of indispens@@ able data . it can therefore be sen@@ sible in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ ten@@ sions , these devices can automatically shut up battery energy . this gives you the possibility to store your data and use them even further . if you use a US@@ V , you should certainly be sure that they have the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security of power disorders with the cost to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about your computer always to tr@@ amp before you travel to the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer you can store any quantity of data .
compared to the HD@@ Ds , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com is available for online storage services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not provide your images in full resolution online . for $ 25 a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies , it is a backup and a distribution memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are due to data transmission errors . the file system is at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is not even though a transmission error occurred , not if this occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for it . nobody seems to have thought on your computer . nobody seems to have thought in your computer . nobody seems to have thought on it . nobody seems to have the internet with its TCP protocol .
un@@ reliable network parts are a further source of transmission loss , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not yet affected by transmission problems you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be able to handle and highly scalable from two candidates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GP@@ L un@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . for Not@@ ebooks , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most mei@@ osis . it is currently limited to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there has been no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to make the common file systems . a very good English item can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , a file is not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ apix@@ els . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and final results are rather deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resolutions you will need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you can get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore you do not use any data loss for data loss . thus , your data is frequent according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , make exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you do daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then a day , a flash takes you happiness when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a Des@@ aster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget aviation accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local store . bring your steps up the staircase , into the adjacent building , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have one backup , which is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files shall be backed up . it is a mom@@ entary lap@@ se without hist@@ ories and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential securing : one backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the final differential backup .
in@@ incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . produces multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only shared and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to setup easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer rates , r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure some important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a moment intake for each month . each additional notes should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , associated with IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time you are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is in@@ fores@@ ee@@ able because of your nature , you must be given everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain qu@@ ence . unfortunately , less variants are used in the past , the more light is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for each . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or your file format , you should check your library and when necessary to convert a newer standard . stay open to open standards .
scal@@ ability is the speci@@ fying pressure for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually does always increase .
let &apos;s assume that you have put the scal@@ ability with the plant and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and leave it on a new record :
check d@@ mes@@ g if your new record is detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in M@@ B@@ oth ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / / dev / s@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if a day no software is available , you can read this itself . this task is simpler from year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can be fun , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can have a relative number of administration information , but not as many as TIFF and we would recommend to save your pictures .
TIFF was widespread than image format . TIFF can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it is very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open pro@@ mul@@ cher format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is already available on the need for camera formats . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also at some point .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced his XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to enter your data into a file itself . the file information are stored with the expansion &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers come in front of an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , and it can view the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems with the link between the met@@ adata and image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation which support a wide range of applications and business models , which is a wide range of applications and modelling work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fied efforts to reach an extended acceptance of met@@ adata and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images on the camera system are you to use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and store them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you add the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut off using the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to Web@@ reel , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photo in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the Add to a album you will find a description as you can add photos on your hard drive . however , the camera interface gives you many advanced settings to import pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to connect your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the machine , turn on the camera to display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is produced , a he@@ fty indicator appears at the bottom and the prefer@@ ential pictures of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not show any occurr@@ ence . if this is the case , fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file order is shown on the camera , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the lateral features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a single entry or his met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded on your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all the information available .
the rider met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata as EX@@ IF , manufacturer re@@ mark , GPS etc . the picture is the same as in the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata must not be available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then select all photos of your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we will be sure to delete the pictures from your camera before you want to delete the photos of your camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button for downloading and then select selected . the button chosen is chosen as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , option is new download . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ; downloaded here . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons of all or selected folders , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed in the pictures . the list of exist@@ ent albums can be displayed in section my albums . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you chose the destination album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can er@@ ase all at once by using the button of delete all . if you only want to delete a few , you &apos;ll need to delete them first and delete delete chosen .
please note that there is no way to re@@ produce photos that have been deleted from the camera . you should be carefully checked , they will be completely deleted . if you want to er@@ ase your camera by your camera . if you want to er@@ ase your camera memory , you should make this about the camera menu because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally loaded especially after the photos of the camera . so it can be meaning@@ fully , the date and time to integrate the date back into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirror image files . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transfer opens three further options that are performed before the photos on the record are copied . if you select this , the respective entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , use the command string .
if you use the option to use camera file names , you have the option to change file names in lower@@ case , or if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; for a picture is indicated below the name , the camera is stored in preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all the cameras use this information . in the section side bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not supply these information , you can plug &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera has been made about the date , at which the photo was made , I can use &amp; digi@@ ous ; all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all the cameras with the same date will be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . in the section side bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced , and select the file @-@ based sub@@ folders at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . choose uploaded . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appear in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection has done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you want to upload the pictures up to the camera . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted by your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this means that the data can be indicated in length and lat@@ itude . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to link an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; user w@@ ishing to locate the location of the photos , or simply could document this aspect , it is good to bring about the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , ar@@ tic and map refer@@ ences . there are at least three ways to get this . directly with the right hardware , on a editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the ge@@ ographic order ( manual ) and most recently through the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera , which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are some of them working with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR &apos;s Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , these data must be stored in the GP@@ X format , as it is the only format supported by the module to the ge@@ ographic order .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ config tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters matching coordinates using map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to give you much control of his work processes as possible . there are many settings that access the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; change in the menu settings ; select between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
action can be selected on custom@@ ised preview or image processing . specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fixed if you click on an entry in the top view .
this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ still did@@ acy and the legal data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is written automatically from the camera interface . it is also written in a database synchron@@ ization that these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the authority , this also must be filled .
publ@@ ishers is a syn@@ onymous with provider : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if this is shown here for a message agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is an image photo , then the group or agency must be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this makes the met@@ adata permanently contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ adata stand also available on other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without being lost .
image ri@@ vals as embedded in JPEG pictures ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments using the images embedded in pictures . this allows you to read your labels from other imag@@ ery . caution : when images that have already been conf@@ used , these can be used by the kn@@ itted by &amp; digi@@ ous ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse po@@ inter is at the main window over a file . depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which data types &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; indicate , you can add the file extensions of this list ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no such extensions , are ignored by &amp; digi@@ al ; ignored .
the default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the lighthouse &amp; digi@@ p@@ un can be set on this page . each time you can open the settings . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only receive fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can turn this here . you can use the tool@@ bar , when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this aspect mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of light density than in the colour format . please read this article in Wikipedia here .
by setting P@@ NG files , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
using the TIFF @-@ files option , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TIFF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free .
with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can &apos;t recover loss@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata were not yet fully supported , but was found in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , the image processing has been developed very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixel at od@@ d lines , this option creates a slightly soft , eliminated this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option marks the picture a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 g@@ itter@@ ing with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white comparison of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set off . it is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the he@@ aters . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the default is the top @-@ to @-@ use , so the parts of your camera are cap@@ tiv@@ ated , as far as en@@ ligh@@ tening white in the settings . the setting colors produces a few unusual results since they demonstrate the l@@ ace in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the he@@ aters .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not so quick as green and red . &amp; cra@@ wler therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you re@@ construct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three must be a compromise and can therefore be adjusted separately for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ate value according to your taste . you must also set him somewhat higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; but in order to keep the time for the demo @-@ icing , you should go serv@@ atively .
a digital image process is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which is a matrix @-@ coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ wing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ cra@@ w set you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive hom@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y @-@ directed ) . after some tests , it was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour loss of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour of color correction , as it is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and returns as they should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as the color space of one color space in the other to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
questions , if a picture is opened in image processing / paint volume module with raw files .
color profile file S@@ ign here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ous ; this file exam@@ ines during the start .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; default catch ; for your profiles . everything can change when opening the raw file later .
the colours view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . only your images are not listed on the whole screen .
the input profiles should be used for the camera manufacturer and model you can use . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any color ton@@ ic mapping or gam@@ ut correction . this means that you do not need to perform d@@ cra@@ b mapping with 16 bit depth . this means that you do not need to carry out the colour mapping itself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image can be returned from a device as your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors . this could be manually correct , rather than to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can fit together here . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion allows the style of the objective : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ery and image processing is supported ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the curtains .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set down in the menu under settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get information about the K@@ IP@@ I project in ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust the time between image outputs , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes shut down the met@@ adata and which at the bottom end of the pictures are displayed in the display .
the camera characteristics show on the left hand a list of all the cameras supported . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which is tried to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . there are serial port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / pool , if you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you &apos;ll need to connect the camera with your computer to display them in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set up camera switches and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for shi@@ fting &gt; images in tr@@ ash@@ can display you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when sol@@ der a photos in an album , you can find more details in the ex@@ cer@@ pts of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used in silence by &amp; digi@@ ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without in@@ quiries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button change .
you can also adjust the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ ous ; in case of Commons , this accelerates the start @-@ up by &amp; digi@@ ous in circumstances ; .
the setting for the new photos are forced &amp; digi@@ ous ; the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the base file was deleted , &amp; digi@@ al came ; you ask if it is going to delete it out of the database .
different colour Schem@@ es can be used in &amp; digi@@ ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be explained below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous , you will find further information about it in this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to watch your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the text menu of the entry and selection of the entry read@@ out .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; so they are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in section editing .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
one menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , no the functions will change the original photo before you can save file or save the button Save out of the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should hold a copy of your image before you change it . you can change it with Save as .
as long as you don &apos;t store the photo , you can restore the original envelope by using the menu file or restore the button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose every change you have at the photo since the last store .
almost any action of image processing can be converted and restored or re @-@ established . the last promotion will return you automatically ref@@ resh or re@@ produce , by selecting processing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you push the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back of the common or restore button in the tool@@ bar you get a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are made between , and again .
once you have started the image processing , you can use the photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , image high , image , or entries in the menu file . if you made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save this .
you can enter the photo in the photo , and zoom in the c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the c@@ auti@@ ous menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use this tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the installation dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can access this from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu file and receive the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . all images can be printed from your selection . you need only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assist@@ ants . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ wall comes ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which is available for important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available , even in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders are clicked on :
multiple click on the same level , the side bar will appear , or disappear again in the rim .
in the labelling screen you can enter or paste the note down . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed to be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data is limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are removed after 2000 signs and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on , you will either use the button to change or change to the next picture , the inscription will then be saved .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also use the met@@ adata in the files . this will always be done if you have a met@@ adata setting , which will always be written in the pictures .
the assessment will show an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and s@@ orting . it can always be applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ view shows a search box for the fil@@ tering of the key@@ word , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously specified in this &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; -@@ session le@@ ased stit@@ ches .
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search phr@@ ases . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many examples .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ er of the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the above image and not on the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sampling filter .
the side bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed on the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - fil@@ um@@ - , sampling and search results are used . if additionally , one or more key@@ word filters out of the right side is used , only the cutting volume of these two are displayed . all key@@ pass@@ words are available .
you can also drag and place tags . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can easily drag and put them out of the right side bar and place on the selection . as a result , a dialog where you &apos;re asking if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word is selected on no sampling , and then there was a key@@ word from the right key@@ word on the selection and put it there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings .
if you have a rule and have created and notice that it would be a or his need , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a character set , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a comprehensive search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , only use the check box at the end of the rule and after the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve got it primarily on &amp; digi@@ ous ; s specific implementation was adjusted .
the reason why you have a color@@ less workflow is that , the colors come from your camera or scanner come with a color@@ able workflow . with a color@@ able workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor can print from your camera or scanner , or publish the colors that you want to print or publish from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme is based on colour administration , everyone wants to press the buttons . unfortunately , the meaning of this tut@@ orial is to provide you sufficient background information about colour administration . in addition , links with a deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ ational decisions to make you make the desired result .
if your image has been met all six listed below , then you do not need to worry about color management .
you can be calibr@@ ated on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image expenditure feature e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is .
so if the RGB works so well , and the life for everyone is so easy , why should one use another colour space so that thoughts would have to be able to imagine a color break ?
a visual example of lim@@ iting from s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours which we really can see is presented at the bottom . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ gh @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om @-@ ente side and click on Info and then click on Information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to install your monitor . so , your monitor closes down your monitor . if you are using the color space of your RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available which can improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automatic and contrast expand from the menu @-@ corrected automatic correction automatically from your colours . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aled through the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without his color@@ ings . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same method adjusted the light factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be as flat as it is possible , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic cut : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright borders and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in selected images and may be a good correction for bad photos .
the white off of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white comparison of a photos .
the white @-@ off @-@ correction is slightly limited because over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which can perform in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will fall better to correction better .
this tool is based on a white off algorithm by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start making it over the menu entry color white with the image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original size , then it goes to the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the pixels of pixels below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ant .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the sh@@ adows adjustment lets you improve the shadow of your photos or down down .
An@@ stat with the above controls are used , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this knob and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use selected colour to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white off with the list of settings . the following settings are available :
the transfer@@ ring dict@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . this will appear in a preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . each setting of the white balance you can add to a text file and re@@ load later .
the button pres@@ ets all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be shown any other photo than your original . if you save this , your original image is changed .
you can adjust the code depth per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time , and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ es . colour ton@@ mapping can be carried out through the bottom window for the use of color pro@@ fil@@ ets you can drag the chapter management department .
another important tool is available in the menu under color error correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always require the same error and you will always find the same error . in the manual for the audio correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool colour effects give you four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image was produced , and after that the development of the image were completed . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally possible to generate a negative image that is not shown on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect from the colours brilliant and brilliant . try it simply , it &apos;s emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors for daylight and high contrast . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors for daylight photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some photographs , especially those who are hardly able to finish , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on counter@@ edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the thickness of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large images , the filter can release the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and light intensity of the photos . you can review the various colour @-@ bas@@ cks of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you get a photo of bad light conditions , you can get a good choice : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will take a good choice for satur@@ ation instead . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of the coating . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of the sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ vers are clicked into the inside and the move can be changed to modify the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to post@@ p@@ one it is to post@@ p@@ one the control and change it as the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the picture &apos;s settings . on the left @-@ hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis is represented . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram function is useful .
three knob : the top for dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color twe@@ et@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original tape to automatically adjust the inputs of the shadow , medium and bright tones . Moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the output values as in the input rate . for example , the compression of output values can be used for example , to create a hidden image as a background , while something else in the fore@@ ground can be seen .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set upon depending on the intensity values of the picture .
save as and store : using these buttons , the set values in the file system are stored and later re@@ loaded , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the inputs will automatically adjust for all sh@@ adows , medium and sun sounds . if you want to use the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original program for red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option indicators controls all the channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , so you &apos;ll get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image is indicated . the preview becomes dynamic in dependence on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modifications channel : this box box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module :
in addition to this cheese sticks there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode has a wide beam . in this case , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a c@@ est@@ eil to the right , for example , the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are correspon@@ dent with dark out@@ ings and the corresponding image pixel are dar@@ ker dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos you will see a red mark . if you change this marking on the area you want to change , the right line on the curve is displayed , and move a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : using these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve which you have created may be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is Gim@@ p Brief format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons make automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the s@@ lat@@ e- , medium and sun sounds . dis@@ able the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option codes are checked all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant channel . s@@ lat@@ e- and sun sounds was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied on the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color sh@@ ines of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the tones of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and impact . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison on your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you place these in the picture , a vertical line appears in hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to adjust these channels . if you are able to activate the appropriate colour . this is especially convenient when you use the option of mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel mixer then uses the tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from far@@ brau@@ schen , which looks not in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion so you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first .
save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then download . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option indicators controls all the channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , so you &apos;ll get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ activated . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white , a working step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film screen@@ shots .

green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ tes : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ tes .
rotary filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar shots to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ters .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the attack . this is quite similar to the process of ex@@ foli@@ ation of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sin@@ cer@@ eb@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture apply , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures onto an image .
by adding a texture to your image , ir@@ respective whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the length of the deep or three @-@ dimensional texture of texture in the picture .
a paper text is applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) . the relief parameter is set to 200 .
mounted with the digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the borders of a photo is not easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to be a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame the module can be started using image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . in detail the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a wide and wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) , it is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : specifies the frame &apos;s width in percent . the value range is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this target is larger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of pictures , especially when you have used the tool following the aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format text in any picture in any place . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the larger has to be the character set . at the end you simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the image is finished .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image is stored once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
using the digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool template , you can create a template on a picture .
the menu picture template uses in the image processing can be used to place templates across a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be adding to the file size of the template ; if you want to add your sten@@ cil bank , you just send an e @-@ mail in English to the digi@@ plug ; ma@@ iling list digi@@ BO@@ e @-@ Users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the knob base for dialog . choose the folder where you have copied the template files . these settings are mentioned for the next start .
after the root folder for templates has been released a project management which reflects the folder structure of sten@@ cil printer . the selection of a folder will update the template &apos;s templates .
a preview of three buttons , which allows you to change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the displayed picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this knob shr@@ inks the image below . if you want to turn the template on the whole image , you need to adjust the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; presents three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , grain pictures .
fil@@ tering mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it is a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Chang .
reproduction is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that sharp edges are combined with only minimal differences to a common color . the same phenomenon occurs when colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more subsequent sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures a camera has been applied to a camera . images in the shell format must always be tigh@@ tened in during processing .
some scanners contact a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen a photograph with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . this can be correct with the menu entry .
however , you should get careful , since the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you will be focused on the menu entry . on the focus further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the image is slightly soft to draw . use the tool to adjust the switch with the menu entry and try something with settings . the default windows on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove s@@ ander from your photos . a demonstration can see you here .
the original image and preview can help view the image . the default window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tried out at first . if you make the draw points to be strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius sets up a number of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed images at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ver@@ itable image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the amount difference . it can therefore define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties are avoided and therefore beauti@@ full error in face , cel@@ ulas and water surface are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ cor@@ m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Tool Re@@ focused focused on a picture due to improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected y @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to push a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing system . this is better approach as merely to try the photograph . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ bration . so , the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing pictures is the use of a visual acuity . reproduction , it can start from the menu by calling colors editing in the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s break . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s break has a very long tail , which makes the mathematical outcome away from the source pixel , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes undes@@ irable findings in most cases .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp , but you should pay attention to Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
correlation : an increase of the correlation can help arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . needed values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ed effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the rob@@ otic filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to prevent image quality .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your fault @-@ visual acuity . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you need a value of zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix size . however , an increase of the matrix size may produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , please note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitr@@ ary parameters will have set the set to be saved and then can be loaded later .
try all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions to the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much sur@@ g@@ eries changes are not visible immediately , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ fact .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg , eg ; when JPEG , you should comp@@ ress the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by a sharp m@@ asked bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it is necessary to generate un@@ sharp bend . even under optimal conditions it is never able to remove the effect of the fil@@ tering . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters are always at least as good as the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters are often better in the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to an in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about methods to be used in digital alb@@ umen , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob provides the sharp@@ ness of the range of the bott@@ oms in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows the adapted colour for the pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the error correction tool is one of the un@@ developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ A@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders Gl@@ ät@@ tis and Advanced Settings .
detail controls p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass above the picture . a value of 0.9 should then receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is needed . please note that the details should always be ad@@ missible .
depen@@ dency depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction only . if you will create a fine @-@ cell similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be the best in a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value as the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter contains greater structures . the higher that value is set , the more is smoo@@ th@@ ed , since it is then hard to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular focal length &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depen@@ dency of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , then it should also be small . be sure to create a long runtime . so you should choose this value as much as possible and un@@ acceptable for your needs .
integral step length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller than 2 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never higher than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More on quality you will receive by selecting this option is only low . however , it doubles the runtime . we recommend it therefore to allow him .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . each setting of image error correc@@ ting to a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
visual error correction is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob .
below , you can see how image error correc@@ ts with little arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was used in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug power supply ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter hed@@ ert .
this tool can be selected image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ . ; effects of recorded photos from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
screen photo above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined smoke that can be removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the bottom window details and the bottom window advanced settings can stay with default settings .
radius controlled the window size , 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel , and can be p@@ inn@@ ed by the radius indicated above the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ th@@ ed , and thus dimin@@ ished smaller flaws .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sc@@ ep@@ tical seal . this value defines the pixel pitch of the filter to front . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details can be re@@ activated . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot get more and noise or dirt occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire room can be removed or smoke peaks . set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illuminated tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ening process of the details .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ening process of the details .
gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas which typically are stronger , however , it is contam@@ inated the s@@ lat@@ ted areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius appear on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smooth , if it can be too high , can remove smoke and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter in the edges . it can remove smoke peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store and store : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved in the file system and then loaded later .
this is an example of how a noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected using ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution , the image is a bit soft , it is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen it with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting with the smooth menu on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ p@@ comes ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted ar@@ te@@ facts about your images . it is very good adapted to remove j@@ unc@@ ture , film gra@@ ins , krat@@ om , compression band@@ age and local bugs which occurs in digital , original or later digit@@ ised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and therefore ob@@ tains the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the text effect is carried out with another tool , the error correction method . the algorithm to restoration was developed by the IM@@ A@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ée and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct this problems .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob .
below , you can be restored like a photo with equ@@ aling noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ ori@@ ous film fragments on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , Tex@@ ture was applied to an old colour photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ fact that origin@@ ates from the scanner lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixel makes it a hot@@ pixel of photos that have been used with a CCD camera , eight have been used . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially a problem with high quality raw mode photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pixel quot ; on a picture with a dark@@ est sub@@ trac@@ tive method . there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark@@ ening . the tool will recogn@@ ise automatically the hot and bright pixels .
if you have an old digital camera it &apos;s important to take the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD default .
first described in the previous section , you should upload the matching dark image to the correct image . note here that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically re@@ load this automatically in the next session .
the picture range and preview can help you corrected the result within the picture . the default window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all imagin@@ able areas .
select a field to see the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . after that , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel pitch . these are the available filters :
thirst : it is determined an average of neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective Pix@@ els in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from a pixel pitch are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel can be made to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ ous correction is a tool to correct adjust the v@@ ign@@ ited corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , often allow the entire sensor sector not evenly light . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ ign@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light onto the sensor . teleph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used with Center @-@ Filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects arise due to movement .
with the large expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s felt and colour camera , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which is used without these filters , the transformation formula turns with a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
in three shelves , you can control the correction of the v@@ ascular filter and add three other exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting from an optical filter with a aperture setting of 2 , de@@ pl@@ ating the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of v@@ ign@@ ant , to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ intensity , contrast and gamma settings : the edit of a picture with the v@@ ign@@ ant correction is reduced the lumin@@ ance of pixels . they must re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image using these options , as you have to only increase positive values as you need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the coating of the target image , set the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma with zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the v@@ ign@@ ant correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the adjusted image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ stronger and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour@@ ings can not be corrected using this tool .
coefficient of the second degree is the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar check effect , but fl@@ eight on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
coefficient below fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion part . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of k@@ nee @-@ shaped distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value is stronger than changing the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &quot; corners &quot; has changed the parameter to the parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and therefore conduc@@ ts a correction first graph . negative values increase while positive the picture .
light : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion parameter . the values can be used for your image , are stored and used for the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be performed before all the trimm@@ ing or size changes . the best result lead to cut this correction as all of them . if you have a picture of a picture and then it would carry out a tonn@@ age of fal@@ sely .
to help you can find the best correction to you this tool is a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it into an important place , like e.g. the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cr@@ ust @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu . remove cut from the image processing or over the zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most images , the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some designs as pictures from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that , when you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org web@@ page . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set up two parameters of film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the corresponding texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of the film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels to re@@ produce infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ me@@ ar based on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original image has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of A@@ ura in the peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer big silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back in the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere out of everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo , gra@@ ined view , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values need to be required to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ins on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous design ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a natural @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous design ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and st@@ ills are good for this effect .
there are two knob to affect this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . thick brush are better for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smooth or , from the other side , the cre@@ t@@ ness .
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the image is marked with the ( 2 ) brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous power supply ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage collection . therefore , pictures whose gra@@ dients vary slowly , therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful when you imagine what scene you chose to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob choose the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a simple structure , where color does not work the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ astic scenery .
depth allow the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion @-@ effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the picture in cells and look it as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to wave blocks 1 , the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time with the knob .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of visual acuity . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Rate : understand the image along star lines run out of a focus . this sim@@ ulates the fil@@ ming of a zo@@ oming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radial infin@@ ity : caught the picture by rotating the pixel by a focus . this sim@@ ulates the fil@@ ming of a rot@@ ational camera .
distance : wi@@ pes the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera body . the object seems to be trac@@ ed back in the background .
motion sequence : ignor@@ ing the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the fil@@ ming of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ers , camera .
turn@@ out fil@@ tering : wi@@ pes the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and brilliant soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and sub@@ tle light .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ev@@ ing acuity : im@@ ble the image by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the fil@@ tering of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent fil@@ th@@ ness : find the colour spl@@ ash in the image and ear@@ ed it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created by the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . they can therefore break this calculation at any time with the knob .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ ly look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the trop@@ ic size . since the sample size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image . number change the number and density of the drops . fish stock changes the optical effect of the drops onto the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing has a range free of rainy drops . use the choice of tools to select the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you then start the filter re@@ rop@@ es the area will remain free from rainy drops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ist Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
when the photo is the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Trans@@ forming or transform@@ ate mirrors .
photo n@@ oses is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to resi@@ zing is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture of the picture and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
when a photo is the wrong size you can modify it on the desired size with the tool size . select the trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to reduce the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . the underlying algorithm uses the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change size . these settings are available in the Rider New size and are listed below :
adjust aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained at the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter contains greater structures . the higher that value is set , the more is smoo@@ th@@ ed , since it is then hard to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect , it must be higher than 3 .
button Save as and charging are exactly used . each photo file can be saved as text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what makes it , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after yourself . you can break the calculation at any time with the knob .
below you can see an example for photo bub@@ bles by using a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only one frequently carried out operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the mouse simply allows the rectangle with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and asc@@ end the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
when you let loose the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut off . by doing so , you can change the size of the cut zone by removing the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle simply create it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button of the cutting edge button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save and File Recovery file to save the newly designed photo .
in the fore@@ stry area you can change the size of the rectangle by plug@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool fits into the aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use it or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and whose aspect ratio can be seen below .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to address selected horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . relationship button in the area to cut the size possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation , set .
depending on the aspect ratio , the tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , this settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data can reflect the cut @-@ cut image and not the original image .
the help of the coll@@ ectively helps help to in@@ duce your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ious triangles are an option to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles to the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is the pitch that is based on various natural growth models , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the bl@@ asting leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we are as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , that use your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have the golden pitch in all times when you meet your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two progres@@ sing . a composition of this rule is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle provides liquid auxiliary lines , when you assemble a picture . these furn@@ aces are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ digit hed@@ geho@@ gs , the golden spiral line creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is called the rectangle of golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be used to give the golden spiral . it should be a line that the eye can be cent@@ ered to the center of composition . that can be a line or different objects . it can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles have no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to pl@@ az@@ ing these lines can be scre@@ ened .
if you use golden triangles to open up your frame , you will try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that can &apos;t be achieved differently .
the horizontal and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic part@@ itions .
with the button colour you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adapt the colour of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things get around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation rotation . select the transform@@ ational Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button settings , you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module includes a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to move the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot a painting you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to repair this is to utili@@ ze the function trans@@ forming from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Autom@@ atically Cut@@ ting . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option provides the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out around a fix@@ ation point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . this preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : indicates the width of the new picture , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : indicates the height of the new picture , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : indicates the actual angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed zone .
angle at the top : indicates the actual angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed zone .
angle left : indicates the actual angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed zone .
angle right below : indicates the actual angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed zone .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be a bit dirty . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you fit the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to transfer this to some of the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ forming barri@@ ers .
adjust your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can specify horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you are using pres@@ ets , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of Eff@@ ects will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right .
for your help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the loop tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the calibration , this picture becomes somewhat neg@@ li@@ gible . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible but two ch@@ ings produce twice as much dis@@ assem@@ bling and hence , you should avoid this .
after closing the image has un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write them . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions you will need a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; edit .
due to this depen@@ dency of other libraries it is impossible to give in this place a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; displays only files in formats known . this happens with the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you may change this list of file extensions ; and you can change this list . in the section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format used to use . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ al ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital pictures . in this process , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be loss@@ less , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read below Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can also download raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ p@@ un ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the shop of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is found in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that come from &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; therefore there is no film work program and therefore does not need to view or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ous ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback movies will be used to start playing movies .
go forward to the earlier visited album in Chron@@ icles . you can only go forward when you went back before .

( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the occurr@@ ence . these modes are :
vertically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected area .
horizontal sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper range shows the original and the lower the filter is applied to the range below the selected area .
vertical section . the left shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper range shows the original and the lower comparison to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fore@@ stry area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be placed in order to show over@@ load and under@@ coat . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from a preview . you can drag this context with the mouse within the image and look at the part of the image , which you want to see the preview of the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings are mentioned from the last use of the module .
the page bar features shows the essential information about selected image and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider introduces an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ Rac@@ eway . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course also giving your image Geo @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets @-@ files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
the pall@@ ets @-@ files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the files to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it displays the colour to the colour . the colour is described under the pallet view . here , the colour name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse in pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box is inserted in the button colour , the color will be inserted directly from the cur@@ sor by the cur@@ sor . the color will be placed either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode you can adjust by using the check box under ad@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a two @-@ line characters , if there are three numbers values in the clip@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the palette and the colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour anywhere on the screen and then you will find in the colour selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ s ; -@@ s ; -@@ s are free layout programs . graphics are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that can be programmed &amp; graphics ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ demo@@ s ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ ered ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

other required software : &amp; m@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ bit ; -@@ program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate bottom window . at first , if you start &amp; inter@@ viewer ; without argument , the tool@@ bar will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list last files opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot matrix files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed , if the graph is greater than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically .
use the m@@ apped wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the straight in &amp; inter@@ viewer ; loaded file changes from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can your choice also notice , so you can change your decision later , you can make use of the menu settings k@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graphic file outside a running &amp; inter@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in file brow@@ sers or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to open the graphics in a sub @-@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice , but also change the setup dialog .
with program start , you can re @-@ open all graph of your last meeting . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph can be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graphics that are placed on a page will enter this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages divided graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again gives you the opportunity to specify the behaviour when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or to ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page open is the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify if a graph outside of the current session is opened . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window , or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is questioned .
the page seat management is the option to define the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if desired .
the context menu , which normally comes with a click on the main window with the &amp; RM@@ B@@ n ; there are further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for ar@@ ising graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or str@@ ati@@ fied represent@@ ations of straigh@@ tened graph@@ s . the algorithm uses the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce short edges and as far as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ equi@@ voc@@ als graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the ski spring model . in this process , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses the same characteristic of statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a diving line layout for un@@ eri@@ ed graphite . it uses fru@@ str@@ e @-@ pure gold he@@ els , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and geo@@ ster@@ ling graphics .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm assign@@ s the node a barrel in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout commands when using a shell command , and the calculated layout of the graphics to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such layout commands you can specify &amp; eg ; the graphics with a filter change , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ done ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for @-@ oriented , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ painted graphics ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be used tools to redeem new pictures , and install them .
for this module , this module can be used to redeem new pictures from external sources and can be used . currently , two sources can be used :
scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports the san@@ e project or another source like e.g. Video Stre@@ ams . so that &apos;s how you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e .
if you sc@@ anned the menu entry images , a dialogue that you can select between all available sources on your computer . choose here the source of which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the default standard values to select your image before you start reading the area . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window will be completely displayed , because some settings can not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file . here , please remember that the type BM@@ P is un@@ compressed and therefore very large files . you will also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create a file by selecting the image .

select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you &apos;ll need to upload a trace file containing GP@@ X file , such as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , automatic correlation between the coordinates must be recorded in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera body must be converted with GMT . this can be carried out with the time zone . click here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera security . the deviation from below are the data collected and the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds is cor@@ related to all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limits , and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog is to use the coordinates of a call to the next one , you only need to use the button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found on the shown map and after it can be found and enlarge . select the appropriate region and increase si@@ e.@@ Guide this until you have to be selected manually . the card may always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets of M@@ j@@ peg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide @-@ format . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD . for burning the medium you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the pictures which are packed in the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can start the module with ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change s@@ orting of pictures or contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to select the file on a TV , you have to default the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of image transfer is fixed among them . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , it should be set in black . set the name and the path of the created file you can specify under the name of the MPEG output file . keep on the way as possible .
if you specify a audio file under the name of audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can enjoy all settings your wishes , you can easily drink with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or in all rest a coffee and enjoy the slide once you are back .
if a hint appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
printing assist@@ ent makes it possible to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ format . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. , to improve you or print using Gim@@ p module to direct print .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert images stored in the RA@@ W format to one from three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original score from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera vend@@ ors . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the R@@ aw @-@ Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now optimize the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal to and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a dis@@ mis@@ erable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your picture and uses the for@@ ce@@ able L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you pre @-@ edit your pictures or later you should not use the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before converting the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata that are stored in the RA@@ W file are stored in the file of the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process , you can use it off .
the pile processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode , therefore , if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the option . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview of progress is not available as far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image or enlarge . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen size .
not proportional : not propor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo set . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the selected pictures before .
after you started the module , the image window with the selected images are displayed . you can add more images to you with a file selection dialog . for the recently selected image will be displayed a preview on your right page .
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of the resulting images .
images of the selected pictures from the list of images are removed with the button images .
after you select all the pictures you can open the new message with the button OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you have to add here the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as app@@ endix .
please do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of posting e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and every time you use it until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a fixed file , the comments can be added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted below the loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore have P@@ NG if you don &apos;t have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend to JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures in file format and then select the original files in JPEG format , then the original file data will be added to the affected pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status messages , on the search for errors , however . your e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end . with the knob you can read this window ? EN .
after the start of the Mod@@ uls &apos; slide show a window with questions as you want to have shown your di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation are using very elegant image processes using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide is very slow .
the file extensions option provides that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
for this option , the loop makes it possible to display the presentation into a final loop . you can then break manually with Es@@ c ;
the pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in random order , so it is not the sequence of pictures in the album .
de@@ cel@@ eration between the pictures can be set between the images . 1500 millis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen effect effect . you should make this one before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random from any transition between the pictures another effect .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can connect to a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to switch you on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file names , the location of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these questions , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work@@ surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ wheel , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can connect with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; through these brow@@ sers , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , now in each group , thus in persons , places and in group keywords are available .

if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view the pictures of your work area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; cool albums ; however , for every person you can store an own image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories , which you have defined . see this image .
to display images next to the name , select the button which you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . note here you can select the view for each category separately . that has the advantage of you to display symbols with pictures of people and at the same time you can have a list of key@@ word ( if you have no appropriate pictures for your key@@ word ) .
however , you need to specify what image for each individual person is to be displayed . in the context menu , you &apos;ll need to select the image of the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the c@@ auti@@ ous window , you may adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore select that part of the picture will be shown and cut off .

you can also select a range of time line by clicking the mouse button and mouse over the line of the time line , so the time values go . if you select a range , you will select the selection only images of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a beam in the timet@@ able .
&amp; k@@ fully album , gives you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the User &apos;s book , the integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu file ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the passage and a description that the HTML file should be included later . on a cool album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; cool album ; -@@ Export file will be created , which is to be seen on the visible page . ferry information about export files will be found in .
finally , you can choose which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . so , you can avoid that information are displayed on the HTML pages . for example , all pictures are from a party . for example , all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide specific images before certain amount .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most import@@ ing options are clearly , why this is not specially developed .
below on the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . this allows you to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images download that , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer at your side can change the resolution at any time . it allows you to browse your pictures with a low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , browse . if a picture is bigger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setup area you place the various folders and the URL that your site is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be stored and automatically added for all future images to the location . here you can select either a folder or by K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this really select all the viewer . if you have created for the basic folder a web browser after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong file .
in the case that the HTML files created not yet in the final destination folder you need to set them manually . in order to specify the import function , see , right , you need to specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folders in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described setting possibilities have related all three on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name is set in output folders .
if you &apos;re looking for a family party , a meeting or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you can naturally create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you already have already spent a lot of time , the image information , people on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; cool albums ; this work will not even make them once again .
with &amp; cool albums ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database . the image features are being imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file or whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether you have all the images stored in the file , that you may have all the images and put this file so independently . however , the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , it will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for pictures in two times . first , the images that are displayed in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if you don &apos;t find the corresponding pictures , the images of the URL that you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible when you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export Pictures will be described , which you can call on the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are you the following three options :
at the option manual , copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file .
with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copying &amp; cool album ; the pictures will automatically be used for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG format , and the XML file itself is quite small , it usually doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page contains maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , please don &apos;t want to limit the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would be quite large . here you can specify the size by saying that every image will be 800 pixels high and wide .
after you can select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file imp@@ lic@@ t ... select &amp; cool album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select what pictures you want to import them , afterwards , in which file the import them to be copied .
it can be that you can find the category people of imported file person@@ er ( if you are a D@@ is ) , while this category is called for your database . so you will be asked to be imported in the third dialog box which are to be imported into your database and which categories these categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can see the categories of imported file using the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures and view : when you see images , you would like to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you might want to see all the pictures where this boy@@ friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) of the information on your images , over ( 2 ) the search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
this photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures but frequently , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; cool album ; saves all his information in the file th@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; cool album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future start automatically . if you want to start a different database with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start playing &amp; cool album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings menu , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can change the settings in the following section of the user book .
to the left you can see six different icons with which you can call settings of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call for the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can define for any image , such as people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
on the dialog box , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned in detail . in the dialog options , all members of a group allows you to set up all members of a group once in a group instead of all groups of one member .
in view you can select the setup options available to you to the fixed list box . with the above selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ fully album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plu@@ gin interface . wet information please find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; cool albums ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with each other applications , it can be used to test new modules with the demo database before using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or on the menu . do not say , I would not have been warned !
the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other uses does not support their images in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to records , so that you can use the functions with &amp; cool albums .
here &apos;s sim@@ ulated &amp; cool album ; the current record , which is simply the current view , so all images that shows you the picture gallery .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; cool album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then every record of this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category which you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so do you want to use the category persons , so do if you have selected persons to have selected and give it to the module .
since some modules are equipped with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select the modules , which are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you &amp; my photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are acc@@ ust@@ omed by any other K@@ DE application , see the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window below . in the section we will not find information on this window , but now click on the entry images , which shows you an overview of all available images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; is the possibility to view any picture with comments on the picture where the picture was taken on . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images as shown on all pictures of Jes@@ per and recorded all the pictures in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sers , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you can set three lists with a text box by providing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to transfer the images within the list : if you have a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be seen , so that the used names are moved back to top , the persons can find quickly and arrange them .
if you prefer to receive an alphabetical list of the list , click on the icon for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image , you might need to edit all selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes . click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , you can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to one note with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the United States as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the att@@ entive dial@@ ogs is possible to add a entry into an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also use a entry to a category and put this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just need your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of att@@ entive dial@@ ogs by connecting the edge , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drag him out of the window section .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which gives you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also finish a frame as well . if you want to show this window later again , use the button options ... and then windows 1 / off . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser you will get a glance with showing images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you don &apos;t have filters . for example , you can configure the size of the spectac@@ le , simply plug@@ ging in the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply time .
when you make a picture in the background of your desktop , this image will be set for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview photos . simply select the appropriate pictures you want , and press either the removal button or select in the menu edit menu . now you will display the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; cool album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere you have stored on the hard disk . of course you need to record the pictures anywhere , so you have to record the pictures anywhere in the image . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are present , so &amp; cool album ; you can see the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t watch these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this feature you need to copy files from folders and copy it again . if you do not want to avoid problems of the appropriate CD . if you wish to avoid trouble shooting , please buy a larger hard disk to save all images .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you will filter the pictures so that you may see for other un@@ accessible in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister , check out and choose the menu entry everything except for current view .
with this you have set out what pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop to your little sister , simply choose the menu entry pictures , whereby all the pictures you want to have closed will be hidden . if you want to recover the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into the un@@ lock of the pictures . to establish this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not sure to read or delete all images on the hard drive and on the other one can read or delete the password as an un@@ encrypted text or delete . this type of password protection is only used for those who are talking with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not very familiar , views to private images .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; cool albums ; manage and say about hours about hours . this reason , you want to look at some point . for this reason , it has a picture of _ and video viewer . this is what you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the image you want to see and adjust it differently . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information can be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , appropriate entries to this show . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were interested in your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded multiple pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and use the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also reachable from the Cont@@ ext menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as slide @-@ up . then , a new picture invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . as frequently the new image can be controlled by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus resp . Min@@ us . the slide is done by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can play in the image and zoom into the image . with the Min@@ us key you can zoom the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , as shown on the picture is not drawn . with the equation button , the zo@@ oms set the zoom , so that every pixel is equivalent to the screen of a picture .
note that the only zoom operations are working with videos that are coming in and out with the Plus@@ - and min@@ us@@ aste .
in the context menu from the context menu , you can turn the image . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes about the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you consider pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the image . at the moment you can view the image and configuration dialog of the picture to select this name . but you &apos;ll notice it only the picture to mark and look other pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and select it as good or bad , while you want one after the other .
for the two examples above , you can see the possibility of features you have the possibility of features , while you watch them . features include the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you push the corresponding letter . in seeing a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so you can view all the pictures you need , print or whatever you have selected , so you simply add all on once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . afterwards you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the front view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can easily add the letters to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature , after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allows you &amp; cool album ; on the picture to paint .
the brick is not stored in the picture but in the database . on the way you can reverse your old later .
in a picture , you can see a picture on the painted . in order to switch the painting from &amp; k@@ fast album ; in order to finish the painting from the context menu . in order to finish the M@@ alen , simply take the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely preserved , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then the properties in the object properties are displayed and the object in the wire model views are displayed yellow .
you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the subject of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either to insert the object in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following opening menu will be embedded in order to select the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under editing , or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on users to accept these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message will be displayed using error description . then you can click the error error and re @-@ click on the user or to break the changes with dis@@ rup@@ tions .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the quoted object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own view .
press preview in the own image view and a small example of the scene will be chosen with the selected texture . as a default , you want to render a texture within a texture map ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of camera .
if a transformation is selected , dis@@ appears the inspection points and it will be displayed a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for schi@@ p . you can change the shift through pulling in the entire window .
each object has a visibility level . you can specify the value relative to the visual level of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will be displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visual stage of the scene chosen .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window code as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window code , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to ro@@ uting a window over or under one present view , pull the shape to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views over each other , you pull the mouse in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card box at the top in the views .
the last possible window order are pending views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anchor , drag the shape to the desktop or click on the little to the left above @-@ pointing arrow in the suit bar .
to close a view , click on the small Cross in the An@@ c@@ row bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are pending , you can em@@ bedding it in any place .
the current window frames can store you with view window code . it will display a dialog where you can save the window systems under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings click on the tool@@ bar or in the menu version R@@ ender modes ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can set any name any name , but a name that can recognize the properties of mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you like only a small area of the image , select the check box section and give the image section to ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Re@@ flexi@@ ons Lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in User &apos;s manual or P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered by pixel per pixel , various mistakes may be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general pictures see images with this feature better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is increasingly split up and adap@@ tive because each pixel is increasingly split up and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values is exceeded , then both pixels are calculated using a specified number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated additionally , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the distinction is divided between the colour values , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be pursued individually and adjusted to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , it changes and P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the latest attitude for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is a experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene files , choose the menu entry file imports ... and choose a file in dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er currently works ; not the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import them , write these sources between the two special Comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the Editor Text Editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene will be human . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you are looking for assistance in the own view , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set here the path to your document and the version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you refer to files that are not listed in the folder , you &apos;ll also need to register the path to these files here . if a file is used in different trails of the library , the first file is used .
the colour for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window identification number .
you can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of the open @-@ model views . you can adjust the grid separately for rail , sc@@ aling and shooting .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better brush@@ cutter for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high quality assurance for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , a floor will drop below the objects . the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you cross edge deposits , the non @-@ recur@@ sive non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling levels can be adjusted . accurate information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window of window the window can create and save window orders .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard Pro@@ cedure : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window system in the start of the program .
the list of Ext@@ ant win@@ dow@@ ns shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button adding and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
every window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen windows order . new views can easily create and remove selected views on the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with box card you will receive a cart@@ card view together with the previous view and pending the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more specific knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should easily create the ultimate , but very popular among beginners : one ball on one level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain about it as a result of only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black image .
if you add no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll receive only a black picture .
if you have any fault @-@ free , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols right now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry edit . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene , which you generate . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the object properties , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later different lines , but note that the camera will change in the view point , with which you can change the camera off the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the input button , change the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately after these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ ary body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a non@@ sense method of solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view is now also the plain , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you click the entry options for each new object . in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . choose a shift and adjust the values as follows :
only select the floor to stop its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something very Simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue where you can select how the object will be inserted . please choose first accommodation . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button preview , like the pig@@ ments looks like .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a sheet black material , because you have settings for your pig@@ ments . do you always remember to check the look of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but now take you the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and then call a preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the Far@@ ben@@ . you are expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ Far@@ ben@@ list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the property tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to run , since you should have understood the basic working number of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as easy as the bottom :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : at 1 ( do not forget to push the input button or the button to press ) , so that the ball might drop down with the ground . otherwise , you would have moved the ball over the floor , as you move the floor down a unit down below .
of course , the rendering is now a rare result : as soon as before , the ball surface appears like a sheet black material . set the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you . as in the bottom , enter the ball a pigment in color :
choose first object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ments . click on ball pig@@ ments , then select Ins@@ ert and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve an interesting effect when you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the input button .
the settings shine effect and reflection , already partially good visual effects , perfectly suited for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : still not selected is :
you should now have a good impression of what are possibilities to you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hop@@ efully , you have already learned how much you can create , but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when using a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the rendering of the hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects scenes ) is reflected in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as the atmospheric effects , such as fog impact . so the scene will process pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some lighting sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you have created before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
the scene files stored in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only select if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the most recent command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you refuse to edit editing .
saves the current window system and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new type configuration or an existing order .
in this menu , you can find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to add or add new commands for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; commands or new .
opens a dialog to setup the tool@@ bars . you can add using this option tool@@ holder for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to specify rough surfaces , without any diff@@ rac@@ tion in the surface and to change without the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms which can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ball show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be represented either in a window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with click the &amp; LM@@ B@@ n ; or press Return .
you can adjust whether each picture is displayed in a window , or whether all the pictures are using the same window .
if you are searching for a certain file , simply type the first sign of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a password file is found in the right corner . if a password file is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialogue In@@ set - &amp; ku@@ b show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set up the operation of &amp; ku@@ b show ; in the two other , short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cut may be specified for the respective window .
if the image is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area filled with the background color will be able to adjust it below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ b show ; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ b show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; check show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when in window mode the window is larger than the image , also the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; check show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also represent the program .
this option allows for large images added to the screen to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specifies whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first picture in the folder or the selected image .
the interval between the image changes at a slide show . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the Dias@@ how is repeated as long as it is interrupted by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ b show ; in the maps of short order for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the second part of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
shows screen@@ shots for files in folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
resi@@ zed the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; check show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
this image shows in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .

in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that it is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposure dict@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ies should display the colors with what you are to display , in contrast . sub @-@ exposure should display a dark colour and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge , which gives you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also see this page bar in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ ier@@ ite ; is an application to sc@@ anned images that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and scan .
&amp; sk@@ ier@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and sc@@ anned images . can open a dialog for storing images or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also view the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the gentle projection page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projection ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ ating ; using the command line &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . breaking &amp; sk@@ ier@@ ite ; end .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ ier@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not contain these options especially .
to enter a picture , the user can only start a preview and then start scanning area for the final scanning . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started through the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom in the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview of the window fits .
when the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before store a preview can be selected in the settings , then the image will be shown in a preview window , shown below , then the image is stored and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you will return to the main window .
by the button settings the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change here the most important settings .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option has to display a preview before saving a preview . if this preview is not requested , then the option has to be chosen .
this setting allows you to select the type of &amp; sk@@ ating ; pictures stores . dialog for storing each image opens the dialog before each entry @-@ called image . if &amp; sk@@ ier@@ ite ; this automatically allows you to save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you &apos;ll need to ask for a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored at option . if the pictures are stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically stored pictures and is additionally the proposed name for image in the dialog for saving . that automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric search ix of each time when a picture is saved . the character string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality for saving . this value changes also the compression value while saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ etch ; -@@ manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ etch ; . the button settings shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to end &amp; sk@@ ating .

you may need to install existing multimedia buttons such as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function could pause &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command options .
you should give the user a review when the script can not be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all the modules are present and use the dialog where the user does not run a script .
Beg@@ in &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; the dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the file scripts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply determine the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing scripts are relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programmes and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example of Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all current scripts . this reason , scripts are going to monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to save the storage and loading of the setup data , each script must take care of each script itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change High volume signals an amendment of the volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ menu , Sub@@ ject the path to the selected files of play@@ list , if a custom menu entry can be identified . in order to add an own entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script , e@@ Custom@@ p amar@@ ok script , e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are additionally compressed to b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also recognize the archive with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended amar@@ ok@@ script . this is why you should ren@@ ame your script packages right .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and connect the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side by &amp; amar@@ ok ; please use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts use scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player to &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music through the play@@ list instead of endless menu . maybe you can also find a quite certain title from tens of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection @-@ search and quick @-@ search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never choose which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ list browser needs exactly the right for you . and if your decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ list will automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . Moreover , many different audio systems can listen to as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sh@@ ick - just the right to discover your music !

the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . you can define it on which screen of a multiple monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate further possibilities in this card card .
the card collection is used for setting up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to refer to music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folders Brow@@ se this : that causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders after music will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders ( e. g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ list import : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection file ( .@@ pl@@ and and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ list will appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part of collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup is necessary in the bottom window of MySQL .
the MySQL device is used to set up the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used on the computer that the MySQL database is set . after that , the database is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use us@@ ern@@ ame : and password : to insert data that needs to be used for the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m support the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names from played pieces at a heavy load server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here , enter your us@@ ern@@ ame and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .

&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K only requires the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to find K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because or amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to comp@@ ile C@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assumes that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ ec@@ .org . for example , Flu@@ x@@ box is ready for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can check the file by clicking on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org and add the kap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and let the collection restore again .
mostly it lies that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ Info from this file crashing . please report these errors at the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ Developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try a SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if B. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads to crash when processing a met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ light via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail address automatically with a crash ) . if it is often a frequent crash and you will find us a good back@@ light , the error will be guaranteed .
this is what many program data is written as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but they do not mark the Unicode script . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &apos; error during writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl @-@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;@@
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the status is de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you need to click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : Un@@ plug symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels , then check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t @-@ library . you can see using the ld@@ d &apos;@@ Pat@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ac version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K may find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy the lightest through the help of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or developers . you can also use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error , if you get something about the destination of an error in am@@ aro@@ e itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok , just a blank play@@ list . how to get music pieces there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired file . then drag the files to the right part of play@@ list .
to make the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is converted into the statistic window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the rating through the user while the points are calculated automatically .
in order to evaluate pieces , the evaluation list must be shown in the play@@ list and select column displays . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to define the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press rele@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from a play@@ list from the fold @-@ down menu .
pull a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and leave them there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s that simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the Add @-@ button , the button play@@ list is located . click on it .
probably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ ward , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under the equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end of independent approach , therefore the actual question are : what media types does G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support the real audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it can be ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where the default does not contain any MP3 Dec@@ or ( for pat@@ ent@@ eous reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Alp@@ habetical product
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows for multiple applications to be used to run and simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or via the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem @-@ cause and a solution . for g@@ amer you might need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. , oss@@ ack ) .
this is done &amp; amar@@ ok ; you don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded for most people . g@@ amer is the best choice if you read a dé@@ c@@ or with little over@@ head . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coding them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data . G@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate sound servers with highest possible priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ arity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ d ; : bur@@ ns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also choose &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore automatically sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning of CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality is achieved when used audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding . OGG Vor@@ bis benef@@ ited from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : here is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
advertisement : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . advertisement will be used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss @-@ free audio compression and compression modes . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module to read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD .
SO@@ x : a utility program that can convert between different audio formats and used . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a functional scope fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool can be used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for the creation of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections , the different record seal of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect which can be played differently according to the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save below is displayed , with which you can select file and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you want to save up for every single project .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then choose between stores and changes . furthermore , you can also break the closing time and open the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should be done , exactly as would you have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project , what should be done , as if you would have called Cl@@ ose file .
when you call this entry , you can choose from the published dialogue files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you want to draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can change many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are talking about what is that ? help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is appropri@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain within the project . this function does not exist any files from the medium , they only end the previously imported files .
open the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also just create a copy of a CD instead of the normal head . you should also prefer to copy mini@@ bus if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialogue . this also allows you to burn DVD copy to a different medium . alternatively , you can also use only a copy of a DVD using the copy dial@@ ogs . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . you can delete all the contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously set CD image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not yet supported , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn an earlier DVD image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box is usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but also can also be used standing . it contains information about the read video , co@@ di@@ ac settings and even possibilities to change size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information will be displayed in the content screen and include properties of medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar currently is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small vest is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is out .
the folder view is a or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the drive or re@@ ject the media .
switch the content view a or out . the content view allows selecting and select files into your projection view . the view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder .
the copy of the coupler is a nar@@ rower area , which is only visible when the project has open open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key order below .
this is launching the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , system administrators need to be set up to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; as many other &amp; k@@ ills ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ actor .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that is a bit more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your tasks are crucial , which gives you the right programs .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program tested , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mod@@ ular Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ MO@@ NA@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ MO@@ NA@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ I@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ I@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) bi@@ COP@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) void @-@ form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void @-@ form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which is applicable only for data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string , Q@@ string , Q@@ string , Q@@ string path ) void of void ( Q@@ string path ) void of void ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
this is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / au@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Reader for &amp; k@@ de ; With him can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on encoder that are installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Traditional ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the read of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers used to en@@ code these WAV files ( This code packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if installed it have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and comp@@ ress in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
are usually compressed to WAV files in a second step ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ eil ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package , if this is not yet installed , this must now be done now .
for the second step , advertisement ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre @-@ to ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . however , only the code packages are not needed to comp@@ ile . if the FLA@@ C does not use it , its installation is not required .
which code / file format should be used ? the chapter which code contains a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ views . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protection is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to avoid protected audio CD ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while adjusting for one time only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found until a suitable configuration is found ) , after reading a daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard disk . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of user interface , which you will often arrive at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is included in it .
this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step for example , there are further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starting the CD@@ DB inquiry into the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be produced . )
starts out the read and - when a encoder was set up in the tab on the tab setting settings - the coding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that the option can be read with another encoder as standard . it is to be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the tab setting settings dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a file size will already be selected to en@@ code a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different map cards ( such as Encoder , for adjusting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ils and compression ratios and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commerci@@ als that can play these files .
among audio formats supported by data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG mag now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame will be free with most distribution options , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rate ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at a deeper bit@@ rate .
OGG - If only music will be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ players are present .
MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer to most people and most music pieces acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music from young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ ogram . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the highest quality without return to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or by the program automatically from the Free@@ DB via the Internet are available as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed / needed with &amp; audi@@ oph@@ thal@@ ating ; and the code program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there are often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or assistance to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches on these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) add MP@@ 3s with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title Parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ oph@@ thal@@ ating ; parameter which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , where people can download / enter audio CDs , so that all the other information can be downloaded from myself on your computer . it is to be aware that only texts by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m ) isn &apos;t attor@@ ney . however , nobody can publish the information on the &amp; CD ; more or less value less , so can neither the artist nor the music company harm . all information can be preserved in a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ views , you can use a check box ( sending an address ) to the use of Free@@ DB . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the server ( This can only know the programmer , who checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ oph@@ onic use ; for the use of Free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically is to be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and equ@@ ates the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of mir@@ ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ ev@@ ing of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; or alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updating the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more precise , searching in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
for storing the WAV files , the code format can be selected for advertisement ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a for@@ ce@@ able compression for audio data ) on the tab . other code can be added on this tab .
the code package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code of code . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer are listed in the chapter space code .
after installing a body , further information can be obtained via his switches using the input of a command like lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . advertisement &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read performance of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that may indicate what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD ; and this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step for example . even if you use other settings , this will give tips how to proceed .
have you read the whole manual , all understood , but somehow still lack anything to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to make those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything one setup and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be able to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps , on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as a compiled package for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for advertisement can be found as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file , whatever you can do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy it with the counter ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ views , something which probably will be done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what a phr@@ ase and CD must be repeated .
here we determine the defined code for compression of the music ( lame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy to use the Free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet are downloaded .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably do it at any reading &amp; CD ; change once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the selection program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map displays General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be sent / entered as shown in screen photo .
only for incomplete information , select that you will be informed when information is missing in keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet that he can connect to the Free@@ DB server .
the second sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are later un@@ happy with the database post or file names , it can be easily changed . the directory or file names can be changed with Con@@ veni@@ ent - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter all manually , the select fields and Free@@ DB is not used . however , it can be used with Free@@ DB locally in offline mode . however , these can be selected using Free@@ DB in offline mode , the two selection areas must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request for calling the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server on the Internet . how do I know the system which data to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . do all this as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we only want to use the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org page and look at a mirror server near you . on this way , the load will be distributed between the host computers . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work as equal to the server , because many fire@@ walls date the protocol of 88@@ 80 . maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data on the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should not be sufficient .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously read pieces : exc@@ use , there is why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel , reading and codi@@ le ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you cross this file , then the path / folders must be stored in which the WAV files are installed . if the box cannot be crossed , the files are not installed in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do anything with WAV files .
everything just enter as it is on screen photo . the command is a bit long , under conditions you need to be bl@@ otted to the right .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 - 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted when needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside these sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : at a du@@ al@@ core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Play ; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never have to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; it is described in the previous section . first , the folder structure is set up , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB must be found in the previous section . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD .
since we contain a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ DB , see the screen photos a little different than the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eve it from the Internet . comments may refer to differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD now ; into the drive which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and length in the window should be listed as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up from Free@@ DB , all tracks are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can select the database @-@ associated entry , which makes your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for the settings ) you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , but the data from the Internet , you &apos;ll need to connect to the Internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered anymore in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ at@@ ell each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments on all pieces of CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the Free@@ DB file , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to make the contents of the CD @-@ editor , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. all words with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to verify if there are any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &apos;s tab . this option is set up on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ Settings menu ; take a look inside the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see Help for Ko@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , which is obviously with the style of the chosen CD ; this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data just why go to the web site of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are found under Rock .
after the election of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already covered with the entered data , which we have for the first piece . simply enter the entries in the fields of the current piece in any case and other information that you wish .
click the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already available in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the unit list .
note that it has a check @-@ in front of each row of a piece . only the titles that are selected as selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select all the pieces select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection check out the window process started , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with orders and track what runs out .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a code of code that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the output of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to format MP3 . therefore , read and en@@ code in parallel . note the status review in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only thing configured is un@@ clear , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to read and en@@ code at the simultaneous interpre@@ ting ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the waiting line of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message will be embedded in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ views , you &apos;ll need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Play ; if you know with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ eil ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read it , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at individuals that comp@@ ile of source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for searching for your needs , if it works once again , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step for the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked after the first time of the program , without any access point as it should go on from this somehow , no audio CD ; in the drive , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already has the program started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual and cause it to do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read it , he has put this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
wei@@ rd when you managed to get the source file of the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player game of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real screening output of texts even some features that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of activity of each MIDI channel by approach the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ writer or text events ) . K@@ Mid determines the process automatically .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
fir@@ stly , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog where you can select the desired song .
you can also get a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will be able to fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , you can open it and move the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry fold from the menu or check out the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you move it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump into any position by using the middle mouse button and drive out and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or played slowly , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed . to get the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space button as a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu , so interrup@@ ts the space bar while not played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play on playback .
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics cont@@ ex@@ is and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be represented and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need to set up a song , so that you do not need to adjust it manually . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a event type , select from the menu setting the entries of text or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in line after you . in this section , how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point .... Click there to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection you will get all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you must add a song in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again the file dialog where you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is added automatically to the active collection .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the series after the sub @-@ menu entries of the menus , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be set again .
to play a song , select it in collection manager or use the select list about the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the record next song from the menu or press the arrow arrow to the right .
to jump a song back to jump , select the button 1 piece , the entry preceding piece from the menu or press the button to the left .
to er@@ ase a collection , open the collection manager , select there the del@@ eting collection and click the knob .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter if they are saved by &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always separates trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the respective file ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all the required modifications for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear so often as desired . it is , however , that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D and KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map . ... EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you can see that it is needed to display that one section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices which are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use will look like this :
please note that the left side of the DC sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM cartridge are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you must not change the order so as well as no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that does this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your Keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you may take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a def@@ ective surplus . for this purpose , please bear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ enses ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum @-@ patch of the patch , in which every tone represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not such that means the sound level of the always same drum ( such as some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as their presence . they need to create 128 entries .
you can define several Key@@ chains for every channel and any instrument . you only need to use various key@@ chains in the first row .
key@@ chains are used mainly to form sounds on the per@@ tin@@ sions channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ word .
this section can be used to control some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , you can simply use the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be ignored by the name &apos;s name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ kus@@ sions Patch on the Per@@ kus@@ hima channel .
the value for pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ ratios are multiplied , in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 4096 is used to make any dec@@ imal number in the map file .
this setting is used because GM gives that a keyboard that will play a Pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 4096 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards up to one octave can be played . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ res you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to show that no longer uses the original instrument .
the channel view has ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view of the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD shows the speed to be played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you like to find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it . it contains the music , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same score in very different ways .
good , i can &apos;t necessarily stay , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB . ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over all .
this can happen if you compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without any AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before sure , activate the option Autom@@ atically Add Collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can select the arrow button on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the reproduction . in order to restore the standard temp@@ o , click on the LCD double .
I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ) or lab@@ eling ( if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , only change to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file only once you want to add directly to a collection , click the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
for example , suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. only once you want to play the first file . so you will set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then follow , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . at the moment , I &apos;m interested in my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . as Hob@@ bies , I &apos;m thinking program of collecting MIDI files , music and propositions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge anticip@@ ation when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . you would like to send a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to receive a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I maybe already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my leisure and didn &apos;t get some money for it . I want to do so , because when I get back messages of users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E @-@ Cards .

and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , which gives us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to that , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his website , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development and look at it links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you &apos;ll need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it works as if you would have any sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail list or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ et@@ ern@@ ame ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is in it .
it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu Book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , that should be played according to each other , you should use the Category Permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ chair . if you meet a entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and play begins with the indicated entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and infinite play@@ list can also be changed , but also through the application itself . however , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , can also be changed through an editor , but also through the application itself . through the click of a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu with play@@ list and selected either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at the starting and ease can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ml .x@@ ml and / / .@@ k@@ de / re@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate the opening of another source . however , this would be the end of animation , however , the user can stop the application for a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the display of a favorite photos : &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a Rider on configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as the one &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ Mozilla will be played here :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; even the special field can be inserted for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be used in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog by K@@ DE .
the counter or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a console application to search and after error messages related to charging the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ o should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play anywhere from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the scanner should be used to use and the TV channels can be set manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box is to be found in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be selected ports which will be selected . for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can also use only X@@ Video ( presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also necessary to work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functioning for the X server in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , by KM@@ Player for the sources different names are used . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this dv@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ man , t@@ v@@ source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ int@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the play@@ list .
are you aware of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from it ( not by the VCD file : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after adjusting the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must every time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player takes automatically the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surface and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional instrum@@ entation application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably goes back to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the c@@ ile ; -@@ website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are given to this project or its documentation , the contact about the c@@ ile ; -@@ website should be established .
questions about or in comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; in or , enh@@ ancements , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphic surface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to find out the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter from &amp; Kate editor .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct practice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . w@@ ager the ur@@ ent &amp; tex ; easy to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ . L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic nar@@ rowing is that it desc@@ end from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
there is not only a good summer view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it &apos;s not the ultimate book to be done . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other sign@@ atory languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that are specified with the general characteristics such as paper format , side numbers and text@@ books will be specified as well as a letter of text . the introduction starts with the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ \ { document } .
the fast entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for the fast preparation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) offers some useful opportunities for creating the document . there may also be some of the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : this will hereby describe the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; Letter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ pr@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this allows the encoding of the system . it should be used to use modern systems increasingly using UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . it should be UTF @-@ 8x intended for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN rules ) . you should always consult German texts .
new users now have no wor@@ ries . it is merely a short description of the functions and further information to this section are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile , it is still noted that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is due to the modest look of the output file . however , it is due to you by the greatest appearance and time saving .
with the automatic loading capacity of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a space ( for the input of the text ) and the additional line to connect the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu of the menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ ver@@ ted element ) :
in view of the document in the structure of view the individual items can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective view .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rounded File &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font , and also other information such as the font . it gives many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and rooms .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r sear@@ ches , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on a element in the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on the opposite side . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding section in the DVI ; -@@ viewer spec@@ tions .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used to work with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified using other .@@ tex files . when using a project , project duration can be set to project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no errors are available in the source code ) .
file attach@@ ments : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file on the center of the street . it takes place there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation .
in consideration of the processing tool@@ bar , the three large selection box should be developed for the rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The prescribed &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders for sub@@ division are :
the selection box contains further information on the inser@@ tion of articles such as tags , joints , notes or references . the insured is :
name : with this command you will find a name for one section , a picture or different element .
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection to select a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is indicated . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; by hand .
the last box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the fixing of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the joints , music , etc . , there are the following font names :
when calling from &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason for the creation of a new document .
the brackets for the command \ \ centre class include the settings for the command . the adjustment &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font master . if the font size cannot be specified , this can also happen in the text .
as soon as the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled ; the easiest way to this is the use of the menu of building or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing , the storage is automatically set up .
the compilation of the document error , should be searched for errors in the protocol . when using quick installation , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
an environment ( English Environment ) is a text that is created differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font is created 12 and only a couple of south you should have a different font . so , the order to ad@@ mitt@@ ent the font family within the surrounding area .... &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â . &quot; ( English . ) .
the claims will be overcome only within the vicinity ( \ \ \ { Environment } until \ \ end { Environment } ) . there is no obligation ( number ) for changes within a environment .
there are many respec@@ ts for the threat of read and us@@ ability of the document . it can , for example , certain fon@@ ts , fatty pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ str@@ ations , etc . these commands are either related to the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { empi@@ h } : this command is suitable for the cur@@ sive pressure , until it is closed as long as long until he will be represented by an \ \ end { word } or another environment . a single word in one movement can be represented with \ \ F@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background to the writing of the source text by the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ recording language , follow the step @-@ to @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few custom@@ ization for the better read of the document should be completed . these should be reduced to a few positions in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem about the application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document was viewed , it can be returned to the editor by editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is an approximate file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ée ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print out the document ( in the viewer ) ( unless the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the transformation of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can begin to select other formats using the button in the tool@@ bar .
before searching , allows direct jump from editor to add @-@ in position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setup for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . for this purpose , only Modern on Settings ... Tools can be selected .
in order to select the advance search , the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source code and shut down on previous place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; click the button mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Document of the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; c@@ ile ; used and for the appropriate line . for this purpose , &amp; k@@ ile ; published as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ( ... editor )
if using quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer , you can &apos;t find an error . should a error occur , this will be displayed in the protocol file or in the Windows window .
the log@@ ging file will always be used to select the error source in the source code . in the editor , the log@@ ging La@@ Te@@ X errors and nuts are always displayed on the error . in order to check the def@@ ective line , click on the error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the correct line .
once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template for the document . the pre @-@ set file are :
for selection of empty document , a document may be written either from the reason to re @-@ written or the assistant to the quick compilation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
independent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be saved , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new model , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document , a template using file New will be replaced by other data ( such as name or character encoding ) . these variables can be adjusted in Settings ... settings General .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ S@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ customer class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ S@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that therefore linked articles in the editor . as soon as the document was created in this way , the following steps can be completed :
when creating a new document , use the own template instead of the standard area .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and can be executed under described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out in the menu tool@@ ing directly from &amp; c@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its kind of vision should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can walk there directly with the reading of the chapter from &amp; Kate editor .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command set , which can be called for the menu of the La@@ Te@@ X Reference . you can also find an evaluation description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can also be used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with hidden C@@ tr@@ l button to eliminate the &amp; tex ; meaning that this way is balanced by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with the left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with jag@@ ged switch box , nice parts of the source text in the editorial window will be grown .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse and emphas@@ ize the different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are characterized by another colour .
many assist@@ ants have to agree on . this is a separate type of bookmark within the text . the menu image will allow the jump to the native or last jump brand . in this case , this trampoline stamp is emphas@@ ized automatically , so that they will automatically check in the first input of a character .
the processing is probably one of the main aspects in using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although great importance has already been made , in &amp; c@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code may be added ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are contained in text selection :
a complete section of ( group of lines consisting on both sides contain an empty line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines ( as in other text@@ box ) . this extended importance include in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is therefore that the stock is separated by two blank lines .
this selection has also extended the word under the current cur@@ ing position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a surface finish ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for reading a part of the document , of course , the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own commands for a faster result . under editing , the following commands are contained :
this is a complete paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description on processing exhaust gases .
it has already been revealed that environments are a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under editing environment for easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the order to open the area .
with this command , at the end of current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the order to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or within the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } , the end of the environment is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many , ambient commands , the view can be lost rapidly . this command shut down the last environment , so that the variable ambient structure is not broken up .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ as@@ ps ... } . under editing Te@@ X group are some important commands that meet from processing surroundings .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the weak@@ est cl@@ ammer .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing plate .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the weak@@ est cl@@ ammer einer &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many disappeared groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be lost quickly . during this command , the last group completed the last group , so that the missing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups can not break down .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings as genes are used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple beginnings . also for the end of the beginn@@ er , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; however , you know this case and for two close beginn@@ er signs to &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double beginners can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and off @-@ off .
it can also be used for specific adjustments ( e.g. wet or French ) and that German or French courses are used . there are also many other languages available .
when fitting the Shift ; En@@ ter requires &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but not only one line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables environment , do &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be easily accessed using Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in the tables environments and all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) can be connected to each other . although this tab@@ ulator is m@@ apped , it is necessary , for making &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ iors are added to the column position of the current table .
although and Kate ; already a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; c@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for and lat@@ ex ; ) , three are used for automatic processing . all these modes can be adjusted for automatic processing . all these modes can be adjusted for different work@@ places under settings .
at the beginning a new environment through the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ \ &apos; area } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the check box is removed , the last letter of the input is removed , and therefore , the list can be sc@@ aled down . on the other hand , the list can also be resi@@ zed by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a command . alternatively , you can also jump jump to these positions by means of editing disk brand N@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ough jump brand , and the required parameters will be available .
under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; digest@@ ive settings are made for these lists . there are possible variety of words for example &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as additions of the general language used .
the command mode is not suitable for the completion of environments . it is always used to have a large list with \ \ begin and the call for the ful@@ filling mode is used to provide a large list with environmental conditions . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the ful@@ fills conditions or the touch @-@ mode Alt + Shift button , the order will be automatically frozen and it appears \ \ \ { . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued and the environment will continue to be completed and by pressing the input button .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; c@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is used .
under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; digest@@ ive settings to these lists . this mode is used to execute the list of the complete mode for example &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line user @-@ defined list of ab@@ dic@@ tions , which can be replaced immediately through scrat@@ ches . the lists can be created ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word that is fully @-@ contained in the menu mode , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character set .
large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ end@@ ars are not helpful for automatic failure . however , it was found that many miracles are written in a document more than once . thus making &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ filling rate is all written already .
this mode can be set up in the menu of the menu ... cr@@ ile compression can be switched off . here , the threshold value for the display can be set .
the ful@@ filling files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / German / apps / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / s home multimedia folder . mode is for training ( ab@@ dic@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¨ r@@ er@@ buch ) or tex .
graphics graph@@ s are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to the view of the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS -@@ files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but they offer an outstanding basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is re@@ arranged , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file into a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , it must be compiled into the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu , creating converting and create view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source material for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file is converted and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command line , a viewer will normally be called after the compilation . if no internal viewer is used , every time will create a new window .
a new project is about the menu project .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we asked the following information for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot;
when selecting the file name -@@ F@@ enst@@ er , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows you to manage the scripts of EC@@ MAS@@ TER@@ .@@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be administ@@ rated in the vertical vest .
the API scripts are still not planned and can be seen in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even further .
first , it must be said that the evaluation environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system to include the basic functions by a wide range of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to sub@@ strate the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . there are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not only about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is a full manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; but rather it is ideal for searching for a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since there is a very large document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents relating to those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the finding of the right document is not always easy ; the small application texts ( doc@@ t@@ k ) , which contains a database with all on &amp; c@@ ile ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories , and the great advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or drums . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the open space bar open the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text editor that can be explo@@ ded on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ite ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has mein@@ weis and how over@@ rides it . let &apos;s take it even a piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! just click on a terminal ; simply clicked the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the an@@ tigen working folder , then you can then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired file in the field of other folders .
output files are filed in the same file as the source file . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , white , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical user interface .
when the file is located inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book it is then simply plug@@ ged the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to a edition on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported mistakes and try it again .
if the file is already selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they let the current file easily Cl@@ ose . if not , er@@ ase them in current file the head and select the file via other file - file selection .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; itself may have a lot to do . thereby , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can not wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found here .
to install a plug@@ in or a c@@ part , we begin using the menu plug@@ ins . thus the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows you to manage all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can input the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path leads to the view@@ finder of the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several people in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship one another . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for a unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as Team Leader and Sub@@ project leaders .
the user can search out from the list of Team Members who he is . this happens by changing the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as expresses . the currently selected member ( your identification ) appears to be : text .
top names and setting of their own identity are important for messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of members of the team : it can be created a event for information to the team leader when something defined . see for further information .
event promotions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project is happening . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so later that a file is secured , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sources selected in the add@@ res@@ see list . the ma@@ ze can be a team or sub@@ project director . see in , white such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comm@@ enters by the following things :
note that note is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ Text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by att@@ entive ext .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the general name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader director Sub@@ project manager After the range and sub@@ project leaders should be cited as in the examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small cases , but no spaces around the brackets and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; Gl@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages that supports DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and woven form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are reachable via the menu . here only about &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called by means of quant@@ a ... called . Dies@@ er@@ dialog extends over a few pages which are succ@@ essi@@ vely treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / classi@@ fier of automatically added tags . normal scale / cas@@ c@@ ense , the tags will be inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ .@@ XML files .
large / classi@@ fications of attributes automatically added : large / classi@@ fier of automatically added attri@@ bute . normal scale / cas@@ ings means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ .@@ XML files .
optional tags : if open , it is optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : like top for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and end day automatically updating : if enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatically generating acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ claimed characters into the corresponding coding during the influence .
anim@@ e types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using button standard , the default address can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way can be accessed using file open files ( where the encoding of the file can be attacked ) . however , this setting is supported by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is supported by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program , this is not the same as the saving of the file . this is not the same as the saving of the file . it is also not used for backup , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial department or a view@@ point ( or documentation in a box @-@ set ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation and the source code simultaneously .
put the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through ob@@ taining the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on the views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves for controlling the possibility to dis@@ en@@ quire of war@@ nings by angi@@ ography of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in divided mode . see the different modes see .
the par@@ ser and the structure , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set in detail in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action by clicking on the structure with the mouse button@@ hole .
in the structure of structure settings , the visibility of no@@ des in tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree is to be opened automatically . empty node include the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where the current document was not found in the current document .
the range for fixed stops ( a sort of templates ) that can be un@@ folding in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are valid , divided . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ lex is something different means in a group is valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be administ@@ rated . plug@@ ins are supplied from third side , which can be used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following plug must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plug in the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of current file ) or the Project Fol@@ der .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses the charging . only @-@ l@@ ese @-@ cure refuse to load if this option is not chosen .
check the Plu@@ gin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the specified information is correct . then , the release of the application allows , then , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting was completely redesigned . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger was implemented , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead of which a de@@ bug@@ ger @-@ plug@@ in concept was implemented that enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the monitor for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that the contents of related variables is displayed . it appears normally in the left dock .
a view that all hold points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view in which the edition ( as shown in HTML ) will be shown in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the monitor , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the Plu@@ gin to listen to de@@ bug@@ gy claims . this promotion is used by default , which will be used by default , so that a de@@ bug@@ ger must not be counted as standard .
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the rub@@ bing according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equal to the use of a browser to view the current document . the edition of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start and information about the monitored variables and the current line will be running continuously . if this happens , while the script will be maintained , the execution has been started , the script will start with the request .
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information related variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution proceeds on . if it happens , the execution proceeds as soon as a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include error rates .
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to over@@ go the instruction and go to the next as if there wouldn &apos;t be the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or print@@ out can be entered , which is supposed to be monitored . the supervised value is displayed in the variation screen .
this dialog can be entered into a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you and quantitative ap@@ lus ; your needs can be adapted to your needs , and how you &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; can help to get better .
documentation type E@@ edit packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - und scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; your simplicity and flexibility makes a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages , and the tool@@ bars . day folders containing two file types , the Tag file and the tool@@ bars . day files are hand@@ some , symbol@@ ise oriented bodies of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document as one user may ever .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , A &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ og@@ u@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . you contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag file carry the name of the writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and clari@@ fies if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information on working with them .
the following chapter covers every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag@@ onal document . it can contain only once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a single element guy above itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it , att@@ r &gt; is the function of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the type class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only available for the type Method . there is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common At@@ tri@@ butes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag . that is an element of element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can specify only once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , there is another tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
the source codes used for the attributes in the tag editor and on the attri@@ bute tree to be used .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method@@ ology name . the arguments that are handed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ ern@@ ame % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ tag that is group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an At@@ tri@@ butes description . it is an element @-@ element type element .
specifies the position of the attri@@ bute text within a dialog box . this day can only occur once in a dialog only once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing table . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ box &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog up in the &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check only at the download of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; .
in the following example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML file . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic day .
in the following an example for a functional family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DT@@ D @-@ edit DT@@ D settings ; therefore , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = using 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as Nick@@ name .
a action can set up with settings ... to be created . click on New action on the same dialog :
this promotion has been assigned short@@ cut . with the button user button , a key abbrevi@@ ation can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the easiest actions . it can be entered into the determin@@ ated settings , and in execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see below below .
this is the most powerful promotional type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or as input ( or portions of the document ) . themselves are the Schnell@@ start @-@ Dialogue or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter can be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ dat file in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / German / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file it is removed from the document &apos;s documentation .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be determined ; input field input can be determined by default settings , which is to be sent to the default value . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the specified application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal edition , on the standard output edition ; error messages , which should be done in the default output edition by default the value is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you &apos;ll need to add promotions and configure settings . select Settings .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start processing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the date of attributes and you are planning your use , activate a dialogue &quot; tag &quot; when available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually f@@ aded , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ alized a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start @-@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol there must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press him .
select the folder where the stored icon is set , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and continue using other tags , so it &apos;s still that , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar or it should be adjusted to better view through several divi@@ ders in several groups . open the tool @-@ tool@@ bars dialog for settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( top left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the Elem@@ entary , that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
I want to access a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will choose it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the divi@@ ders support the group . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your tool bar ( s ) so that their tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the chosen enlargement of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like . this is why I describes a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to make an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ Language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to treat the second section here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c &#93; .@@ pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example , PHP 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for this documentation , e.g. PHP 2 , tag@@ 3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ .2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 1 = html 2 html day 2 = day 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = .@@ html ... Language Reference = basic syntax , ... basic syntax = long @-@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # to G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent with the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; sources of resources will be replaced .
the section of the content is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is to be indicated for the context of a text and pressing of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext List ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file extension lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / German / apps / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a /
if you are sure that these are well and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the resource ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else to whom are sent . at different places , there is an email address , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool @-@ tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; users will be reviewed and only available when our team need them as correct and used for the release . to ensure a useful contribution , it will ensure a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their own G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ don@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you have multiple keys , you may have a look out . in the dialog New resource you need to check out the input fields ( URL @-@ preview can remain empty ) and with click OK the up@@ loading can be started .
the upload can instantly upload the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool @-@ tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading of a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be interrupted . if the integrity is given and the resource is accurate with signature , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that is currently not yet made by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; but creation can be time consuming as hundreds of tag files in daily XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically to a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D shop and conver@@ sions of DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p file .
! doc@@ type defin@@ itions : the strings that are in ! doc@@ type day , such as HTML P@@ U@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / gu@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d appear
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; att@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter has to be able to accommodate these concepts with these fundamental concepts . this chapter provides them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; little use of use .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction applies to a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is possible to secure what is marked as globally , in the joint file structure of &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different work@@ pieces , actions and samples in the global tree , which are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements present a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user list , so that they can use only these users personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be done by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool @-@ fittings specifically for the files of a particular project . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ ulates the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edit@@ orial window , the construction man@@ ners , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please go in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ oning , un@@ loading , er@@ ase or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation , such as fundamental processing steps ( cut / copy / in@@ ating ) , editing the mouse under the mouse indicator , or open the file , if the string under the mouse po@@ inter indicates a file .
at the top end of the editors are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , the number of equipment is shown ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert it , then click the icon that represents the day , then click the icon to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you may fill in a dialog different fields .
the building managers ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information on &amp; quantitative view ; to navigate to open and walk through . in the display with cart@@ ons stand for files , project , pattern settings , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction man@@ ners are available .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative tool ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or delete the files from storage medium to be done with the following text menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on the &amp; quantitative measurement range . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . through the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script will start to edit or send with email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document to the element of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and collection of the tree is opened .
this tree appears under the other building views . with it you can change large attributes and nam@@ esp@@ . that enables the content @-@ oriented injection system allows changing of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for the quantitative view ; you can create your documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be specified , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes pione@@ ers at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the us@@ able information : the News window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about any in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this cardboard box shows all the mistakes in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such that there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; define .
another feature of &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed t@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; quantitative ; like any other back and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . it has auto@@ conf a number of options to get connected to the configure script . to configure a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at the starting of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H is in front of its bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features .
during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to address the development of &amp; quantitative ; what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages would like ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to clean &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized , if one can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; therefore , the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on anything else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ or is not only this possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; Gl@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web@@ developers to increase the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars can be realized by using any script language exchange rate . ( more about it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more about the detailed documentation is associated with help : / Quant@@ a ( either type this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help us@@ her help : / Quant@@ a ) .

a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and complete files as templates for the later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / Text outside the local / project template .
convert from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ prescri@@ ption , so that they are correct and not understood from your browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ confusion , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag used .
switches the block selection or look . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .

shows the symbol column left from the main window . this column allows you to set motion with a mouse click .
when wire Book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing together with the entries prior or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
Book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , after fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows to copy graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; projects you will find details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . the actions must be set by means of settings ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the visual field . do not use it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this enables you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team to open the tool@@ bar in the next release ) . the menu bar opens a new email with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables the upload of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .

this menu includes a list of tags that is available in the currently loaded factory tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menu .
activ@@ ates and de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent Ins@@ ert means that the inser@@ tion is denied by means of tool bar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .

check the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switching between the different kinds of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching sometimes need time need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default screen mode , which is also the default setting mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selection of a contract the corresponding bottom window will be activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window at or from .
the changes in this dialogue cap@@ tures any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brow@@ s .
judge the behaviour of the editorial board . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialogue will appear in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can change the sequences .
however , this should generate assistance according to the scope of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with each open source project developers can always use help . if they want the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial shape , you can find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed on top of the project , as for example , after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties can be set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to re@@ mot@@ ely access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you use this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote control system , it may be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . when used in ser@@ ver@@ ance scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) .
ski@@ ps when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted . if a project is started on new , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will be displayed all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ ken or , through removing the ha@@ iled , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be easily upload in the menu with project Properties in the menu window profiles or with the key abbrevi@@ ation Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eh@@ older are possible ) , which will be re @-@ read in project folders such as project folders .
additional option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about projection views .
this means that the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plu@@ gin can be configured with the options button . in case the trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting is described .
in the bottom window profiles and up@@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , po@@ inter an own building view for each profile .
in the bottom window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see for details .
in the event event event configuration , one can change event action and add these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed if a previously specified event will enter how about the sick@@ les of a file . see in the details .
by default , the movement is opened : the last project , which was opened , can &apos;t influence this behaviour .
to open another project , open Project .... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file behavior is as well , however , the entries are missing and open with ... in the right mouse pop @-@ up menu ( text menu ) :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files . see .
for removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is b@@ lown off to prevent removing .
the password will retain in the core memory and forget to program the program . this option is useful if you need to upload files and that is rather uns@@ afe password on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog when you change your opinion from loading .
the project ( or part of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers , so that the project ( or part of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . during editing or creation of a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server that will be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your an@@ xiety , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can not be read easily , but everyone can see it easily in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views on the project or the project tool@@ bar , can be stored or deleted via settings of the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ap@@ lus ; to its own working methods .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best over the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding to the best . adding tool@@ bars are treated down in the Section Add tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set up either by means of the Cont@@ ext menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be set up in the new action , a new tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries will be removed and action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up menu tool@@ bars and set settings to them in the menu .
templates are essentially inter@@ link , code cut@@ ters and files for the link . &amp; Tub@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates as a usual fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or every system existing in the pre@@ dispos@@ ing space . templates have put in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that not pure text is . it can insert any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally added in documents through cabling ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created from any text documentation . based on this templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to efficiently . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document must be inserted again on a template but the same text area always back into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates . you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quantitative methods .
create a documentation structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template save the local template ....
once this has happened , notice that ( even if there was a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily moved with pulling and off on the tree view .
the compilation of bin@@ aries templates is simple : the file is only going to copy into a folder file . you can use all file management functions for it , like pulling and add or insert through the File Tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files construction man@@ view to create a folder on a folder and secure a Site by default , but of course it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal oriented approach @-@ wise . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ er with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or connect to them . in addition , some things can connect to using templates in projects very deep green@@ ish .
the template structure in the bottom window template is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / German / apps / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
in order to define the behavior of a folder in the template list with the right mouse button to click the folder and in the context menu characteristics . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is un@@ sealed , once el@@ ter@@ ous attributes are inher@@ ited .
this is activated by default and adap@@ ts for everything except for the regular folders . if a regular file would be specified , it would always be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular file .
allows you to print or deleted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and enabled the head@@ lines with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines to equi@@ p the head@@ lines with head@@ lines .
in addition , use the Cont@@ ext menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; Gl@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editorial windows into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and when needed to source code editor , in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL file can be seen in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP . there is no plans to modify this behavi@@ our@@ al code .
the second mode is just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure stops the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a .... After selecting V@@ PL ; view can be adjusted between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation is automatically set to set the period . in general , the recommendation : a small range for quick computers and a large pot for slow use .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the documentation of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also possible , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this enables the reduction of the system code . this enables you to change :
met@@ a @-@ Tags allow storage of information about the document themselves e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the changing of the in@@ hal@@ e , such as keywords on column names and key@@ word key@@ word # 2 on the main page .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list , or delete a change via the list is exactly how in the met@@ a @-@ elements possible . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to integrate a external CSS @-@ style by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is as used in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is independent . the marking works as usual . lyrics can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by in@@ ti@@ lt and deleted by pressing button or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way about the tool@@ bars , such as in the source editor , . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags have already been removed already existing , e.g. an anchor day , which is inserted by text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars as the tables assistant or the lists are disabled . they will be used in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists are necessary .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ or had changed many changes and at the same time had changed the retro@@ spec@@ tion . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in combination .
the program showed me only the changed lines , I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there were no hin@@ ts to the places where perhaps only the retro@@ spec@@ tion had changed . the result of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display the differences in line and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of more useful features have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparative window .
a feature that made much work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ done file brow@@ sers .
also 3 @-@ way assembly is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of body and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to edit conflicts . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can view the result directly . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at summar@@ izing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps to comp@@ ose the same and merge folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder summar@@ ise :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and th@@ inks of the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain amount of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore , if any one changes the back@@ drop . )
when a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then shows the color that the file is different . red color indicates that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily get the typ@@ ing work by using only the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 , diff@@ 3 folder , file folder , diff@@ 3 folder , folder 3 , diff@@ 3 folder , folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog allows manual inputs of file names , the selection via the file brow@@ sers ( file ... ) or select a last modified file from the opening list . if you want to specify the file for the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you use the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
over the Button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge folders will be selected for B and C , but then use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
if interaction is crossed , the input field is active for the objective and process it . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file . you can also finish this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge guide .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . when opening , you must not select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the button button .
you can also use drag and place : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and leave it over a comparative window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to figure out how these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would just need to copy two corresponding files , and then compare and compare these relevant sections simply , insert and then compare .
note : currently , you can remove anything from &amp; ch@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case sheet text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and place of text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info lines of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C has a different color . ( if the path is to a file for a while . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is clearly visible in the next Section ( merge ) .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and commentary , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks enabled , the line will be checked at a broken rows .
the result window ( below comparative sequence star ) also has an Info line with the inscription issue : , the file name and &#91; encoder &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic merge text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , Save de@@ activ@@ ates ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ ints to rest / un@@ solved conflict in order to find any remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference is necessary to have a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows , where the group is not visible in the windows . this group will then be highlighted with the colour background color for the current area , and each on the left shows a black bar .
sometimes , by automatic inter@@ mitt@@ ance or by manual editing , no further line stops in the group ; this text is displayed in these lines ; no line in the case that you might change your opinion , and perhaps again choose another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , still in a mark which you might want to copy and take elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; checks , however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy to this text from the result window . go carefully with this feature .
note : if in case of selecting the sources do not ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will be mainly used with the image running and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard buttons on the left , right , right , down , side down , end , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ early and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ l@@ ent column next to the vertical frame bar can be inserted directly to Navig@@ ate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to the edit . use the Ins@@ ert button to switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ drive mode . ( default setting is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of the group ( as already mentioned in section Mer@@ ging and the edit window window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture back@@ wards / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture back@@ wards ) or to the next / previous day conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture back@@ wards / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture back@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all un@@ solved conflicts has to be considered a conflict . therefore , they must be distinguished between sol@@ dered and un@@ solved conflicts .
in order to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you need to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this is activated , it will always be copied into the clip@@ board . if this option is careful , because you could write the content of the clip@@ board automatically .
Z@@ eil@@ ing lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX @-@ based systems use a return feed sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the line @-@ re@@ plen@@ ishment \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ up of the source file , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored during the next start . ( menu entry level &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( in some systems the dialog can also use variable width options , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive scriptures are displayed . if the chosen book does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed individually . on these systems , the button settings will automatically be an od@@ d color .
if this option is activated , the tab character button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the import of the previous row will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , all selection will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copying to the clip@@ board will then be cancelled .
you can choose which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first step , all of all identical lines can be ignored in the source file . only during this first step , white characters can not be ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . also in combination , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car re@@ plen@@ ishment &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others , however , could only look identical with different sizes in side @-@ an @-@ side comparison , though they may vary differently , but if this option is activated , it will be de@@ activated , however , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is disabled . changes in comm@@ ent@@ aries are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively looking for smaller differences , the option is activated in default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the auto @-@ shift mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next rest@@ less conflict is stopped .
dis@@ solves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default setting is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are not important in many files . if you only use conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning and merge folders . take a look for details below documentation on the list and mer@@ ging of mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of user interface . this option does not include the current running program . you need to exit and rest@@ art the change . ( this option is activated in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally about the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries are used for all entries .
about the selection fields for coding is a brief reference to what the local encoding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters described and interpre@@ t . since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different coding can be compared and combined .
if you have edited a file , you can define what encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing order , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output processing command .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white characters in text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ r ; C is displayed next to normal nor a second over@@ l@@ abo@@ und column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply change the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
in order to list the comparison window each other or over@@ another . this option can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files . current file summar@@ ise together when you use only two files . a simple click starts to rest@@ art the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the recently used output file is retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . for example , you can use this function , or correct or correct use .
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of command is used only at the line level . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable more flexibility when adjusting the diff @-@ findings . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program this anymore . however , the good news is that in most cases sed and per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this prec@@ re@@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 ) . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may be able to understand it and perhaps like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ t . sed &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a relevant , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several actions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the translations of each other . example :
instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e -@@ s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . other operations just change the data that is equal to the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmer can process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate and identify the sim@@ ulated changes without it really ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you need to open a folder on the command line or dialog file .
if three folders are operated , then folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was given , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically launch , do not start the merger , select the corresponding item menu or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you informs about the current progress . if you break scanning the folder , only the files will be listed , which were compared to that .
when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan , click here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is represented normally . you can view a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sign@@ atories insert and fl@@ aps up all the folders with which you can open all the folders .
if you double click on a file , the file extension is started and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such case the merge operation can not be selected automatically . if the interaction is started , you will be informed about problems of this species .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries the color is identical but even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as the same as their whole content is identical . then , the same folder will have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ts . the colours reflect the colours of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy from C ( or if C does not exist , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if it does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e. g. a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects may exist , the merge may not be launched .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e. g. a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects may exist , the merge may not be launched .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no exp@@ on@@ iter target folder , and if the option is synchron@@ ize directories . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical to that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assemble and save the result into both folders ( user watches only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged and activate the new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the merge may not be launched .
during the merge , one file is based on the other . it &apos;s Status column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected . if the merger is completed , you should make a final review and check if the status is fine .
if set the file dialog for Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 contains further columns . these contain the number of un@@ for@@ ter , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can choose either the straight selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the all @-@ time promotions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ file combination mode C as the target , B is chosen as a target and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a target .
if you select a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , and there are some options to be ski@@ pped in folder . check these options for un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory assembly / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ word ) . in order to run only the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
in case of conflic@@ ting file types still inv@@ alid merge actions appear , a message appears on the def@@ ective elements . you can then choose a valid promotion .
if you comp@@ ose all entries , a dialog box with the options result , sim@@ ulations and break .
select Sim@@ ulations if you would like to see what would really happen without the really changes . you will then get an exhau@@ st@@ ive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are finished with a file , select directories re@@ boot / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue to work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in a mistake , a message appears and detailed Status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which can help you choose to solve the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were reported individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and exec@@ utes these entries in later . even if here the merge operation has been taken or not saved , these entries will be regarded as being done . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merger with these options :
only files that fit onto the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . there are multiple pattern to be entered . separate the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; . valid placement holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default settings are not to conform to this pattern .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid placement holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid placement holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ isch generated files will be ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
in some file systems have a conversion attri@@ bute . in other file systems marked a leading point . a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
in links to files : if the option is switched off , Sym@@ bo@@ lic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
for links to folder : if the option is switched off , the links are switched on . if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders and try recur@@ sively . ( note that the links may lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it turns off . ) This option is displayed in default .
runs a complete analysis of each file through and shows statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ for@@ ter , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slow when they are applied to files which does not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster , only the chan@@ ges@@ et and the file size . however , this speed gain cost you a certain degree of safety . please contact with caution . this option is activated in default .
similar to confi@@ d@@ ment date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical , if it is the same size . that can be useful if copying the change date lost . please use with caution . this option is activated in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was given . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . even the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the other file doesn &apos;t have changed . ) This option is switched off in any case . ) This option is displayed in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed . if an old backup file exist with the .@@ original file extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option is enabled in default . this option is switched on .
normally , the file combination will appear in the interaction of individual files ; you can change the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window files in the window menu and switch on the main window in the window menu and switch to switch between Directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double clicking . however , it is possible to execute a single file directly from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status is done and the file will not run once again when you run the folder .
this status is lost , however , when you read the directory again : directory menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax of local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path may be relatively . or .. .@@ This is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file is : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link is shown on a file or folder . then there is always a file defined as link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of the original . ( note the option of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the primary application is currently used as a difference in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts to start the built @-@ in differences . to initi@@ ate K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part I from the context menu .
usually needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes as a part of the patch file . then , it decreases &amp; ch@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch is patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files has changed since the generation of patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or equal folders will not support in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is comp@@ iling ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result in the range of diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time , and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or let him go there .
you can comp@@ ile the program from sources compiled and the configure will not find the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default , K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are classified as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not identical . if you are not equal to Each other , the next to Each other , this one is encoded as this is the case of the case .
the editor noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store these information .
the effort has to be too large . you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after the removal of text is suddenly washed ; No sr@@ c lin@@ qu@@ ed ; published and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished , what does this and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to say good@@ bye . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not published in folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to read the folder with the function Update button . )
there are only entries shown that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are likely to be changed after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior is likely to be displayed in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in default .
note the buttons on the selection of the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines from the respective window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if it is not already available ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed from clicking on the button .
the default option is de@@ activated . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the work surfaces , to change their size , or post@@ p@@ one . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; may display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and also on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; on the empty background only the icon and the name of the application as well as the name of the application as well as the entries could minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and ease . the following commands are :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of your desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on Desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual workplace surfaces will be displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual working area indicate . it has been listed along with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ates , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working areas are displayed in order to enable the selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows the window with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classic and k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid appear , like from stock applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical row , which is very good for the view at the side of the counter .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size as symbols or with their content and move . in addition , it runs out of the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent to choose from switch switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment it is not possible to change the dialog for the dialog . however , you can do it manually :

&amp; cool ; is a screen saver . you can use with &amp; cool ; a part of the display , as you would read a magni@@ fying lens for different users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to complete a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; likes ; is a very powerful application which constantly extends to new features . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; likes ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fication window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as selection window .
in the default value increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ x . alternatively , you can &amp; cool ; for this purpose , a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse click on screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse po@@ inter is shown . please note that the mouse is not able to detect the form of the mouse . this is always the standard k@@ ite ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ x .
in the template mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ x in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move it with the arrow keys .
if you like to use the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . notice that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; likes ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy into a file into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stop the updating of the ad . the stop of updating causes that the needed CPU time is set against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; likes ; automatically set your set @-@ off commands to store files , opening a new window , print , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document again download in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and ver@@ itable &amp; etc .
can also be known as &amp; k@@ ili@@ fier ; it is a screen @-@ lu@@ pe . you can use a micro@@ scope to use the screen pressure in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of benefits : from research or artist to web@@ designer or looking for handic@@ apped ....

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ ises a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffering from the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and each mouse click pain . furthermore , it also requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain , which is caused by clicking on the mouse . unfortunately , through the blo@@ om Be@@ es of the mouse can also be caused by the blo@@ om of your computer , you should search a doctor if this is not yet done .
in order to clear it even more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is used against pain , which applies due to the mouse , because of all the use of the mouse , the result may apply for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your m@@ ash mot@@ ions and performs a mouse click here once you break the movement short .
it is smart shi@@ fting , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . this way you can execute the to@@ es when pressing the mouse button . the smart shi@@ fting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this p@@ ushing time must be fine after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ pos@@ es is switched on , the rot@@ ational shift period ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here it is set time to shut@@ down the mouse button before converting the mouse button before setting up the mouse button after you stop the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . such movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt when the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time , go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer you want to adjust to a lower value to reduce the response .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the relevant documentation , to figure out how to automatically start a program .
set all settings on the values back to the dialog where you have set the button on the button . if you have already pressed the button button , settings are reset to the state after the last pressures of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the default settings . in particular , the intelligent slide should first be switched off . if you &apos;re using the automatic mouse , you can later push down the intelligent slide .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response pages of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds too .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on sites in the browser window , which does not represent a link . you can use the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s normally rather simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come with the mouse button in contact .
first you need to remove the mouse balls . as it happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the sphere , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system under@@ breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a shi@@ fting process . in this case the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation can &apos;t stop anymore due to the lot of the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use one window manager in another window manager .
the solution for this problem exists that you can execute a mouse click . this is due to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can go back as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run cli@@ cks and puts the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to make it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of Desktop , if you are looking for a mouse cli@@ cks . safe zones for mouse po@@ p are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shi@@ fting , but I do not create it to edit text .
the intelligent push is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can cope with it . it is very likely to move in the clip@@ board or move into the clip@@ board . but it will probably cause them to prepare problems . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent slide , when you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : perform a mouse click here and hold the switch @-@ down key while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and re@@ pressed the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you can use exactly when the intelligent push @-@ shi@@ fting stops . later , you can use the intelligent slide without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test Extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker and set it correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse is har@@ med for short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , where the actu@@ ators are prepared pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain period of time is waiting for a pulling @-@ in process before the mouse button is om@@ itted . in this way , the mouse button can also be carried out in this way .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that users can talk about your computer for itself .
with the Program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can talk the computer the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list of discus@@ sing phr@@ ases which are to be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left @-@ photo ) , enter the command which will be used later for the language output by text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the default text@@ books . from the text box you can often choose the password used without it . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right @-@ photo ) you define the dic@@ tionary of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each language . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dic@@ tionary so that only true words can be recorded in the Wor@@ ter@@ ine .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ presses of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a shift memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . each set sentence will be hung on the delay memory . you can select the propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; entry ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog box contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the side Wor@@ ter@@ ran@@ ce and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card output you give the command to enter the language of a language . in the selection box under the input field , place the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; know two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is unchanged at the default generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ ements :
of course , the command to get the speech output from your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are found in the app@@ endix .
with possibly more kt@@ able as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is going to pass as a first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . the kt@@ d @-@ language service is a standardized interface for language output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , which action is triggered by the key@@ word or through the option of a passage in the menu text tool@@ book , or in the strip of text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage is inserted directly and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection from In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field only .
with the second sel@@ ector switch box for text features , you can define if the textbook book is automatically stored in the closing of the machining window .
with the selection of text ratings , the book is stored . if you refuse to dis@@ card changes , the text@@ box is not stored . select Before Save , Will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook book is stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ran@@ ce contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the worst . in the main window next to the input field it shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . you can select the current used dic@@ tionary using this selection box .
with the buttons on the right you can delete sp@@ ell check or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation a . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the step . in addition , you can compare the word chec@@ kl@@ ist with a Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dic@@ tionary to include just correctly written words into the new dic@@ tionary .
this option allows you to comp@@ ose the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summar@@ ized , and how these can be done .
this option allows you to create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words are automatically entered into the dic@@ tionary , you will generate a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ abulary in the course of time .
the main window of the window for the processing of text@@ books is two divided . in the upper part , the text books are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a passage passage , you can modify the passage or the corresponding key@@ word . if you have selected a textbook book , you can change only its name .
actions such as new text@@ books or books add or select selected text messages and books you can either reach through the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a foldable menu .
you can change the order of text features or text messages by pulling the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt + button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the shift memory .
the chosen text is copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the shift memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , this will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default via the menu bar directly below the menu bar . by click on the shaded left side and pulling the tool bar to be moved to another site .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow vest in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is spread out .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text features displayed with entries . the vest is arranged by default via the tool@@ bar directly below the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the left left side and pulling the tool bar to be moved to another site .
probably you have the order for the language output not properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for the language output by the card output . ( see setup dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
the University is a speech output system at the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and added any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival program . the command to speak to the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it supports English language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to extend without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of the language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / iPhone folder . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default option . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ ists in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . this license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / net@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax willing to write the last sign of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ated than in other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / de@@ / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; sub@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be switched on as standard entry .
the language output d@@ us@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continue language service , which offers all &amp; k@@ de ; applications provide a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the adjustment of the language version is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will only need to be able to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on the individual from your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk about the text by the computer . it is stored a list already sung phr@@ ases which can always be re @-@ rev@@ amped using the user .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( type this URL into the address line of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module existing service that enables every application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it introduces a joint application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer is ready to use their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the users provides interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; and also when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ ite applications .

before you &amp; kt@@ ops , you &apos;ll need to install and correct software disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
during the first start of the kt@@ mu@@ g or as long as a speaker , the card spokes@@ man will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set , the screen ticket will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those who are able to distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you should also specify several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should consider at least one speaker set before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise use the speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the default loudspeaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several prints for the same printer .
when you click on the cardboard box spokesperson on the nar@@ rower speaker , the card spokes@@ man will be shown automatically when you start at ts@@ m@@ gr and there is not a speaker set up .
all the speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on top of the list . the top performer is used for speech output if an application does not exist .
with a mouse click will select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
choose a mouse click on a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change settings . see below .
in a mouse click will select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the actors in the list below . the order of the actors in the list determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops system ; -@@ system to apply .
here , choose a m@@ esh type , three male and three female voices , as well as a young and female girls to choose from .
if you click here , on the list of the new speaker on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . go back to the board map General and check if the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; please click on the card card orders to create and manage text entries . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tool@@ bars in General to open this map card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if you are successfully managing the card card , and you can create text applications and you can read text entries and check the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when the square is terminated , running &amp; kt@@ ops ; continue , if the field speech output activ@@ ates ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and the ts@@ m@@ gr is automatically displayed in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the advance is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text entries , stop , stop and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the actors for an order .
click on the button or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card card orders will be displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to activate the K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the boards of the General and check@@ box there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed Website . check first , whether &amp; top@@ us . check the text that should be read and select from the main menu Tools text . after a short time the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; preview lines and other invisible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text before . check first , whether &amp; top@@ us . check first , the text that should be read , and select the text menu . then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;
K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of the events specified by you . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notice various kinds of messages . you can notice that if in a IR@@ C channel you can notice a message , in which your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; top@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ note fy an menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for the Noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
filter for character suspension offer a good opportunity to correct or correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which ends for shipment of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . you remove the b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box because it can be accepted as provided in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is not necessary for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter doesn &apos;t require .
in filters , text will be processed , before it will be sent to the program in @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful to improve the language , or re @-@ replace a proper language and speakers or to get certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the work of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; pre@@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other exec@@ uting and stops these contracts . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resumed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders will be resumed after the release of the warning .
messages are the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that messages are used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text is available on a web page , you can enter with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone is also welcome to enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple texture orders . each order , which you need from the card card orders , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that are used text@@ books . text entries are intended for issu@@ ing long texts which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four sub@@ types will be processed in qu@@ eu@@ e , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send the output of a Screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a read@@ out , this output will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filter has never been applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and continue on the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filter are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
replacing a text box replace parts of a text by other text . the re@@ plac@@ eable parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which will be used by text or as regular expres@@ sions ( as : - ) by text or for form@@ form@@ ation messages from &amp; conversation ; or e @-@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with microphone inputs , you can send orders according to the text content , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read about it about it .
each of these different filters are adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter ensures that its rules do not exist , the text remains unchanged for the next filter .
when a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent to them by all activated filters , which are set up on the page below . the processing through the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of designed normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed in the series after down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be shown below the following setup dial@@ ogs .
for installation of character @-@ suspension filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as comparison chart . these samples are exchanged in the text , then the text is replaced against the associated spare text . large and small written reference will not be considered as comparison .
specify a name for your filter a name . you can choose to choose from the name of the other filter for your filter .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replace it in accordance with the strings from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from above .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that store up or delete a list of file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
here is a language written here , the filter is applied only if the actors for the text contract is one of the registered languages . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse button click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of the program is given by the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be we@@ ed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only copy it .
the transfer filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with a record in the box Di@@ ves filter when agreement . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character @-@ ir@@ re@@ jection filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must be limited to the separ@@ ator ( space characters ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; Express &amp; # 160 ; Express Check &amp; # 160 ; Express Check &amp; # 160 ; Express &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ts &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the spokesperson in@@ discrimin@@ ate filter you can send lyrics to a given nar@@ rator , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define the texts by k@@ mail from a female voice must be read . see .
before &amp; before , there is a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the nar@@ rator will send the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; and the properties of the speaker card spokes@@ man can be selected . with the spokesperson in@@ discrimin@@ ate filter you can write the chosen actors .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . it is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it with a click on the button to get help in the input .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to em@@ bedding the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
click here the characteristics of the talk displayed by you . if the text complies with the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements on the nearest . click on the button to indicate the dialog box selection .
use this buttons to store your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber output filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with a record in the box Di@@ ves filter when tigh@@ ten . you have to put down at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , which allows syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to use these syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications require voice services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program dict@@ at@@ d over the object K@@ j@@ ech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands .
open two &amp; console ; window . start the window in a window , then t@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ sensor filters , but when using the module for the festival pages are not read in .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able is not working at all . you will also need to use this voice to read from websites . make sure the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ score mark seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that all propositions are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , may be solved by a character set filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with every language syn@@ thesizer which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , check the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the web page of kt@@ ops , according to information which are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; E @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you can contact the development team in connection with the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for XML ; conversion filters , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or higher ) , including the pack@@ et boxes and the development files for the program &quot; E @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source codes from &amp; kt@@ ops ; you have downloaded from the source code for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility or to download any night currently created tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ops , please check first if your computer @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the installation of the following disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual propositions . the user can go through or drop @-@ down , repeat the output or cancel the output .
if an application text goes to &amp; kt@@ ops , you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have a speaker furnished , whose language English and its sex is female , this will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , just like &amp; top@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , you can see in .
if you click on the card spokes@@ man to add or edit a speaker on the list or click Edit , the card spokes@@ man speaker setup is displayed . as an example , in the following the device module for the Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under .
specify the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path comes to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed to Festival . at the vote , the &amp; kt@@ ops are announced , this setting will be performed automatically . in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 will use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust lou@@ dness , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a knob and you can &apos;t choose this gray , the voice chosen by you can &apos;t choose this settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices will already be loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set becomes faster syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or forgot to click on the user ) . see .
if this check box is indicated , the program window will be displayed next to the start of the programming window . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol can be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and the ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . this allows you to read or ste@@ wards any other way .
here are all orders placed on the qu@@ eu@@ e , along with the application that has commissioned the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select a passage in the list below , which can be selected or return in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and the ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol of the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; trunk ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also .
only text entries are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops are found here .
here you can select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either comp@@ uted or &amp; kt@@ ops , can &apos;t comp@@ ile the required libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for the audio output , choose the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , choose the PCM device here . see also
adjust the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal speaking speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ x must be installed .
click on the user to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card card you can establish special promotions , which will always be executed if the text contract from a message is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other applications and holds up these contracts . once the output of the screen reader has been read , orders received are resumed .
war@@ nings have the next key priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders will be resumed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that messages sent messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can feel it with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless I welcome someone who entered the room .
if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , insert &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the waiting line .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introductory sounds are active as well , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card map are only valid for normal text entries . for messages , warning and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; take the Noti@@ fy messages , start at ts@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the card noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to switch the read of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops are no noti@@ fications before .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts will be played , where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add events on the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog where you can select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends when someone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else , are of &amp; kt@@ ops are ignored .
use this box in order to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops are supposed to do if an event meets . you have the following selection options :
if you select user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ ements :
you can type the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker that is displayed on the list of the card spokes@@ man as top entry . see also here .
note that there are three planes for events . it is executed for a specific event of a particular application . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . the last possibility comes the action to carry out those under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the following messages as follows :
use the button Save to store the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Canc@@ ell@@ ent . all entries except All Noti@@ fication will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , speaking speed , the volume , the gender voice and sound level . furthermore , trademarks for the control of identification of the sample is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound installation in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually adjusted very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked pap@@ a bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limits filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can be done &amp; kt@@ ops ; faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . thus , you can also ski@@ p the whole text order , even if the syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ limits filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is set automatically set up as a pre@@ ference for a set @-@ limits filter . you can modify its settings or add additional set @-@ limits filter , beginners , however , is dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest option allows you to try out the speaker selection and select text for presentations . check out the speaker selection again and check out some features and check out how the selection of the speaker has changed . in addition , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading the first set , because only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long
you will be able to stop or cancel text entries on the card card , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limits filter is automatically set up when you start at ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything in this filter , unless you know what you do .
pro@@ positi@@ onal filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limit ( tab@@ ular code ) will be removed automatically from the text ( tab@@ ular code 8 ) . note that the standard set limit filters are supplied from the string .
S@@ BD filter are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ age ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders .
if you have a look at the normal set @-@ limits filter , you can merge this back by entering the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file ; included file &apos;s standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the card menu , you can write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words , no microphone properties are set .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all properties of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete the settings of the speaker . otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ops ; the actors from which most highlighted the originally introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired office properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
please select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play any role , enter nothing .
check this check box when the property will have priority in front of other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in comparison of the issue , this feature is rarely used as a priority feature . you may use this feature rare in which you may want to specify the attri@@ bute speech , if you might know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to delete all properties in the field of actors , just to delete the corresponding item , click on the selection button and then click on actors that complies with the Next to the Next .
in this case , 0 is for the final text contract in the waiting line . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr falls off immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .

I have an extra voice for Festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in Festival , but the ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice .
add the new voice in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ar@@ int / voc@@ als / voc@@ abulary / voc@@ als . as a guide , please send us a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the card audio there is a setting speed . that &apos;s how the program SO@@ x is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on selected voice is this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the subscri@@ ber speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ sensor , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; control center ; facilit@@ ates the administration of the network interfaces , rout@@ e@@ ings and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ system ; can be accessed by K Menu bar controller .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package has been developed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ control@@ system ; the network module network settings ( c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a control center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; ch@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured as well as the device at all and allows setting of network characteristics .
in most cases device drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in installing &amp; Linux ; network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network module network settings will be charged if the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; the user interface has tried to automatically detect the used platform at the start of the module network settings .
if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the ug@@ ly range is offered . it is best to select the distribution and release . by checking the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be met permanently . when the next start network settings will then be pre @-@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray if the settings can be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the button in the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire module &apos;s functionality is available . these are divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is on the management of the network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings shown network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button . set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to continue the dialog with further possibilities .
the choice of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for each system start , therefore no further adjustments are required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the selection manual can be performed without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must specify the desired TCP / IP address .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface of bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog can be displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . if the input of an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you may notice whether the desired address should be used in use . in doubt the network administrators should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs . power switching from a network device is selected by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs . switch off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface ....
specifies the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subjects .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the Gateway computer is set .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required , the DNS name is encoded in an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ esp@@ ace of the equ@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a paper and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons on or down in priority .
adding to the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ esp@@ ace , a DNS server can be added . the dialog for the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver will be added .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is then inserted into the list .
from the Group to the nam@@ esp@@ ace , select a entry , and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address method for TCP / IP system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS server .
normally , the list includes names to include some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses work . it is still present in the current version of IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog New alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple known as names , add button adding several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog of Comp@@ ens@@ ing Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , using OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable the changes , the command must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ ad@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of the binary distribution options ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console with rpm like this :
alternatively a tool with graphic interface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development package with libraries and others are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; ch@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information about IP networks . in this Annex , only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
currently , IP networks can be operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 has never seen great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IPv6 is expected that it is expected in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the main information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrators , which can be used by a valid IP address , or , if available , the IP address cannot be selected as desired !
when using a custom small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular network for this purpose to avoid IP address transfer with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by adjusting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is needed for the IP address .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this section there are configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it is not surprised when in case of active DSL connections and other content is specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is dis@@ connected by the scripts in search config . another stand can be found as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat , is a program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar for fast , sel@@ ective spin . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife said : how much longer it takes you to secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trained the band back and reads the prest@@ ressing of the band . know &amp; k@@ dat , the band on the band will not be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ell , search for the matching index on your record . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the band index is re @-@ created .
everything has been smooth , changing the symbol for the tape drive to display that the band was in@@ bound . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band .
before dis@@ card the tape , first the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat , there is a change in the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it is necessary to form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you need to store data . this process does not comply with the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not need to form@@ at@@ ted the tape before using the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require form@@ att@@ ing the tape drive , DA@@ T drives cannot be used .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to choose the backup files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file @-@ tree . it will only be secured or protected from the file .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file @-@ tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file @-@ tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ uan ...
once the backup is initiated , the dialog box settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archive file for the drive . it will only be selected to select the selected file or the folder .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears over@@ looked . this dialog shows the progress of test access as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can select the re@@ building , the files that are to be restored will be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for rest@@ oring . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for rest@@ oring .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears restore . this dialog shows progress in progress , as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a safety profile with the straight marked files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a viewing profile :
the current work folder where the backup is scheduled to take place . the list of files to be secured automatically according to the selected work folder .
for all the files listed under the backup file are that only those files are secured on the same file system , as the folder . folders based on other file systems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry will be viewed from tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be secured , which have changed since then .
the file &apos;s name , which is used to specify the changes since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new sn@@ ap file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files at the time of creating this documentation is not completely implemented .
you can make the settings about the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be set :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ generative model of the strap .
if this attitude is active , send &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is in@@ bound , the command is le@@ ft@@ ly to drive the drive . in some running plants this is necessary , before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat to lock out the throw at tape drive . this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the soldering integration of &amp; k@@ dat will automatically apply the tape automatically . use this option to float Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware prescri@@ ption block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to use &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size is possible for your band &apos;s work .
if the dat file format is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the start of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( s Byte ) The format ID . the format of this string is host : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds to form@@ at@@ ted in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file in the same name .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that directly manage with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as they are not involved in incre@@ mental safety .
test the contents of a backup unit . this symbol is only active when a band is in@@ bound .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; ks@@ s@@ log ; experienced users the quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ cutter blog ; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is appropriate for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is deposited with different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; experienced users have quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ Systems log ; therefore attempts to provide some extended functions , using the protocol files to be filtered and analysed .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ s@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and are explained in other chapters of this book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ cutter log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol file easily filter and s@@ orting . the individual possibilities for s@@ orting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching &amp; ks@@ s@@ log ; first attempts to open the system protocol - the system protocol will start to open . the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to fil@@ tering a list box in the filter bar . the list of the protocol will automatically display the list box next to the filters all . then a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search terms .
you can also select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term will then apply only with entries in the corresponding column . select a column process , and then carry out &amp; ks@@ s@@ log ; all the minutes lines , which were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default settings and helps you detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors will be displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color or protocol @-@ lines of level note . colour display of minutes lines can be switched to setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . so , for example , if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new coming minutes lines .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; has a dedicated website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ Systems log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ d@@ ort you will find further information about reference sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; .
&amp; ks@@ Systems log ; also in the following folders of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is why it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not continue in historical aspects here ( and because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why someone could try to install a machine on system V in@@ it without creating a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it differs from the BSD insp@@ ite that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder means r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to run when moving to the system or when changing to another lap level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services does not include such stuff like set@@ serial , which is only once launched . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie in its part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is actually not much used for this . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something on high , what has to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ compatible . in the initial area you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ pre @-@ produced Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can repair / etc / in@@ sol@@ es from hand , then you can repair it by rest@@ art the system by rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it then start all the right scripts ? if you have to enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this file are no right files . instead , every entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? easy : any of the scripts are written thus that it accepts a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script will be accessed using the argument . if it contains an S , the script will start with the argument boot .
some people desire a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could play &amp; eg ; a server lap record that can run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . Moreover , I also could have a user @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand unit is simple to say to say : go simply an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six Run@@ time levels to start on this level ( or stop stop ) .
you can also change scripts between lap times , or change the position within a level by changing it differently . this happens only if they move an entry in the area of available system services .
note : entries are delayed if you want to copy them into a new zone . in order to copy them only to a new track , you need to select copy from the menu edit or from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the s@@ orting number of a single entry cannot be calculated additionally . in such a case you need to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries in the paper basket . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move one entry into another track , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired lap level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the s@@ orting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the tab button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file , before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are produced in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available . otherwise , they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts again . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single mode mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ down and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not run .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ ix , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type of how system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , the configuration for propri@@ etary programming languages of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please verify that all configuration files are needed ( and also if they are in the right folder ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) is just without a message when their configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be anywhere from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send us more information about Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you &apos;ll need to save them . either use the relevant icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears in the dialog User - or group characteristics .
some map cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you can upgrade your settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will appear , if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the map map password management appears if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as BSD -@@ Unix .
this map card appears only if it is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) file ( det@@ ectable at the quoted file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , the space restrictions on each user can be changed in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field system file system .
the map groups informs about the group of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can mark users in other groups by clicking it in the large box .
the group features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the matching button button of the tool@@ bar . the edit or delete of the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO @-@ boot manager , adding the boat pass@@ words , remove and change the time up to boats of the standard operating system , add the standard operating system , change system operating systems , change , change and more .
