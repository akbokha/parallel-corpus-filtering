<seg id="150">The first what you need to do and know what to maintain your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must be arranged somehow on your computer, whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to change sometime on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location. if you're able to organize enough photos from your date. if you are enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. you will then publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store the metadata in the installation page of metadata. if you forgot this, then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by choosing the respective item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? and digipun came; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you need to select every photo keyword, labelling and an evaluation. of course you can choose all the pictures that will need the same attribute. you can start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's take you with keyword, keywords, as you can proceed with other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogised images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digiplug; automatically add the pictures to the right place. that surrounds the image within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by adding a subtree to another. the modified keywords are deleted by & digious; updated during the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows like different metadata. this is a very coarse representation as each block consists of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data features all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords: the next chapter refers to coating or comments using your metadata about your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to only see most of your photos just let you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographer and agencies. you're sure interested how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama at the distance. from the distance it is not even a nice panorama panorama. if you consider it, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, memories, the historical period is reactive, you may even listen to the silence. the label therefore has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider the title possibly more important than the image itself is more important than the image itself. remember, the key is to transfer a story to transfer Him to help Him over the motive which moves you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect, if it's the strength only has a label to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious, you can save as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time. if you are able to export your pictures in web galleries, then they will tell you the story so for the opening and / or the title of the web site.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train departs of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities can use Geolocalization. I'm sure that a day, in the near future, you can be able to open your journeys by images with geographical information. you can also export the pictures at the reception. you can also export the pictures at the reception. you can also export the pictures by Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all amended versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says the information contained in the setup page of & digipun; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonymous with author and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who used the photo. if it is not wished, the name of a company or organization can be used. after that value it was saved, it should not be changed to any more. this field does not support commas nor Semikolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonymous with author): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples for this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelancer photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the car box, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonymous with vendors): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who offers this photo. if the photographer has a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be shown here if the picture is a picture picture, then the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is no protection against abuse. any of this problem is a digital watermark. this problem is a digital watermark. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digious; in the near future there will be such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, plate failures, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterprevention, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're not talking about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are those who can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Roll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which have a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs, these cautious CDs must be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archivquality. of course, you can also get CDs and DVDs in archivquality. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 this piece set a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you think this is in your device space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it turns out to choose the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you are just written. we use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control environment. despite this massive protection they needed through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">There's a reasonable program called IsoBuster, which seems to appear on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to corrupt the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to save the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non-quality media. read the media with a description, date & author label and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using this media or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floats reserve your statistics for themselves. your manufacturing guarantee include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a big field study on the error mechanism of hard drives available: dismissing</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks will keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error cause, SMART can not determine these errors. some of SMART can terminate the error. these are particularly reading points and publishing count. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to any blackout. before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are not much better. these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high-speed requirements. these anomalies have locked these anomalies, full data loss, hardware failings, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against currents is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest. it is normally available in the form of a connector bar. remember that no connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you're looking for a overvoltage protection, you should make sure that he meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that he protects against blankets and protects the correct devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should also consider that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage controllers, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so, they are ideal for the travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system is used for smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of indispensable data. it can therefore be sensible in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overtensions, these devices can automatically shut up battery energy. this gives you the possibility to store your data and use them even further. if you use a USV, you should certainly be sure that they have the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security of power disorders with the cost to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about your computer always to tramp before you travel to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer you can store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the HDDs, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com is available for online storage services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not provide your images in full resolution online. for $25 a year you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies, it is a backup and a distribution memory. so they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are due to data transmission errors. the file system is at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is not even though a transmission error occurred, not if this occurred in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you have no protection for it. nobody seems to have thought on your computer. nobody seems to have thought in your computer. nobody seems to have thought on it. nobody seems to have the internet with its TCP protocol.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are a further source of transmission loss, as they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not yet affected by transmission problems you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be able to handle and highly scalable from two candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL uncompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not estimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. for Notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most meiosis. it is currently limited to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; there has been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to make the common file systems. a very good English item can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, a file is not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and final results are rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you will need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You can get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; therefore you do not use any data loss for data loss. thus, your data is frequent according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, make exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you do daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then a day, a flash takes you happiness when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot. forget aviation accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasterprevention always means a non-local store. bring your steps up the staircase, into the adjacent building, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have one backup, which is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files shall be backed up. it is a momentary lapse without histories and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential securing: one backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the final differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Inincremental backup: one backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. produces multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes with a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is only shared and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to setup easily on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer rates, rsync only the difference of files that really have changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure some important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a moment intake for each month. each additional notes should be done manually after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated with IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the time you are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is inforeseeable because of your nature, you must be given everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain quence. unfortunately, less variants are used in the past, the more light is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for each. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or your file format, you should check your library and when necessary to convert a newer standard. stay open to open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specifying pressure for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually does always increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have put the scalability with the plant and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and leave it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check dmesg if your new record is detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb; the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBoth; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS / / dev / sc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if a day no software is available, you can read this itself. this task is simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can be fun, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can have a relative number of administration information, but not as many as TIFF and we would recommend to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread than image format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (deflate). however, it is very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open promulcher format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is already available on the need for camera formats. a handful camera manufacturer is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced his XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic technology that allows users to enter your data into a file itself. the file information are stored with the expansion & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers come in front of an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, and it can view the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems with the link between the metadata and image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation which support a wide range of applications and business models, which is a wide range of applications and modelling work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarified efforts to reach an extended acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images on the camera system are you to use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and store them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you add the pictures again with & digi; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off using the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them to Webreel, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photo in & digious; in the Add to a album you will find a description as you can add photos on your hard drive. however, the camera interface gives you many advanced settings to import pictures to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To connect your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the machine, turn on the camera to display mode and switch them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is produced, a hefty indicator appears at the bottom and the preferential pictures of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not show any occurrence. if this is the case, filenames and a symbol for the file order is shown on the camera, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information on each entry. with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a single entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded on your computer. note that with some digital cameras not all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS etc. the picture is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that these metadata must not be available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then select all photos of your camera to a single album in & digi;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we will be sure to delete the pictures from your camera before you want to delete the photos of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; select the button for downloading and then select selected. the button chosen is chosen as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, option is new download. these pictures have not yet been downloaded from & digi; downloaded here. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons of all or selected folders, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, displayed in the pictures. the list of existent albums can be displayed in section my albums. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you chose the destination album, press OK, and & digious; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete this from the camera. you can erase all at once by using the button of delete all. if you only want to delete a few, you'll need to delete them first and delete delete chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to reproduce photos that have been deleted from the camera. you should be carefully checked, they will be completely deleted. if you want to erase your camera by your camera. if you want to erase your camera memory, you should make this about the camera menu because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the filenames are normally loaded especially after the photos of the camera. so it can be meaningfully, the date and time to integrate the date back into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirror image files. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three further options that are performed before the photos on the record are copied. if you select this, the respective entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different file format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. turn the option date & time. for further adjustments, use the command string.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option to use camera file names, you have the option to change file names in lowercase, or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digipun; for a picture is indicated below the name, the camera is stored in preview. your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all the cameras use this information. in the section side bar Metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera does not supply these information, you can plug & digious; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made about the date, at which the photo was made, I can use & digious; all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all the cameras with the same date will be downloaded in the same subalbum. in the section side bar Meta-data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case saves & digious; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced, and select the file-based subfolders at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. choose uploaded. the file selection dialog & kde; appear in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection has done, asks & digious; you want to upload the pictures up to the camera. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted by your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this means that the data can be indicated in length and latitude. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to link an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser to another & digious; if you want to send a postcard to another & digious; user wishing to locate the location of the photos, or simply could document this aspect, it is good to bring about the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, artic and map references. there are at least three ways to get this. directly with the right hardware, on a editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographic order (manual) and most recently through the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera, which has a GPS unit integrated. but there are some of them working with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, these data must be stored in the GPX format, as it is the only format supported by the module to the geographic order.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Exifconfig tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the characters matching coordinates using maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digious; tries to give you much control of his work processes as possible. there are many settings that access the behavior of & digious; change in the menu settings; select between these settings. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standstill didacy and the legal data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is written automatically from the camera interface. it is also written in a database synchronization that these data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for author: this field should be the professional name of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the authority, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publishers is a synonymous with provider: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author if this is shown here for a message agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is an image photo, then the group or agency must be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rock. this makes the metadata permanently contained in the picture and not only in the database of & digious; these metadata stand also available on other programs and can be imported into & digious; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image rivals as embedded in JPEG pictures (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments using the images embedded in pictures. this allows you to read your labels from other imagery. caution: when images that have already been confused, these can be used by the knitted by & digious; overwritten.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is at the main window over a file. depending on selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which data types & digipun; indicate, you can add the file extensions of this list; Albumfolder, which has no such extensions, are ignored by & digial; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lighthouse & digipun can be set on this page. each time you can open the settings. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can only receive fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can turn this here. you can use the toolbar, when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this aspect mode can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of light density than in the colour format. please read this article in Wikipedia here.</seg>
<seg id="297">By setting PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not affect the image quality since the deflate algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can't recover lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata were not yet fully supported, but was found in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digious, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, the image processing has been developed very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixel at odd lines, this option creates a slightly soft, eliminated this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option marks the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 gittering with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white comparison of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not set off. it is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the heaters. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top-to-use, so the parts of your camera are captivated, as far as enlightening white in the settings. the setting colors produces a few unusual results since they demonstrate the lace in various Rosatönen. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the heaters.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not so quick as green and red. & crawler therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three must be a compromise and can therefore be adjusted separately for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminate value according to your taste. you must also set him somewhat higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digious; but in order to keep the time for the demo-icing, you should go servatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A digital image process is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which is a matrix-coloured pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrewing.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and Dcraw set you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity-directed). after some tests, it was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. Bilinear is interesting, if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour loss of your lentils, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a colour of color correction, as it is performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and returns as they should be given back. there are also LCMS and & digious; information such as the color space of one color space in the other to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Questions, if a picture is opened in image processing / paint volume module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile file Sign here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you store all your profiles. & digious; this file examines during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles you have the opportunity & quot; default catch; for your profiles. everything can change when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colours view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your images are not listed on the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used for the camera manufacturer and model you can use. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain any color tonic mapping or gamut correction. this means that you do not need to perform dcrab mapping with 16 bit depth. this means that you do not need to carry out the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate as your image can be returned from a device as your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors. this could be manually correct, rather than to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles can fit together here. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion allows the style of the objective: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plug-in interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; imagery and image processing is supported; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the curtains.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set down in the menu under settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get information about the KIPI project in http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjust the time between image outputs, normally they are 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes shut down the metadata and which at the bottom end of the pictures are displayed in the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left hand a list of all the cameras supported. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which is tried to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. there are serial port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / pool, if you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you'll need to connect the camera with your computer to display them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digious; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set up camera switches and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirming dialog for shifting &gt; images in trashcan display you can adjust the conversation of & digious; when solder a photos in an album, you can find more details in the excerpts of a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used in silence by & digi; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without inquiries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button change.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also adjust the display of the welcome screen by & digious; in case of Commons, this accelerates the start-up by & digious in circumstances;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting for the new photos are forced & digious; the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos. if something from the base file was deleted, & digial came; you ask if it is going to delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour Schemes can be used in & digi; used to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can select under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be explained below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digious, you will find further information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digious; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to watch your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the text menu of the entry and selection of the entry readout.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digious; so they are not part of your distribution. more information on the KIPI modules can be set up in section editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">One menu bar at the top edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, no the functions will change the original photo before you can save file or save the button Save out of the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should hold a copy of your image before you change it. you can change it with Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't store the photo, you can restore the original envelope by using the menu file or restore the button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you lose every change you have at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be converted and restored or re-established. the last promotion will return you automatically refresh or reproduce, by selecting processing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you push the & LMB; on the back of the common or restore button in the toolbar you get a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are made between, and again.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can use the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the toolbar, image high, image, or entries in the menu file. if you made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save this.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in the photo, and zoom in the ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the cautious menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use this toolbar. if you don't want this, you can change this in the installation dialog by & digious; you can access this from the & digiplug; see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the menu file and receive the default & kde; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole sentences. all images can be printed from your selection. you need only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assistants. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiwall comes; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which is available for important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available, even in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders are clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same level, the side bar will appear, or disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling screen you can enter or paste the note down. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all special characters are allowed to be copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data is limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are removed after 2000 signs and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, you will either use the button to change or change to the next picture, the inscription will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also use the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have a metadata setting, which will always be written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The assessment will show an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can always be applied to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyview shows a search box for the filtering of the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with the previously specified in this & digipun; -session leased stitches.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered search phrases. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many examples.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marker of the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the above image and not on the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the sampling filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed on the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - filum-, sampling and search results are used. if additionally, one or more keyword filters out of the right side is used, only the cutting volume of these two are displayed. all keypasswords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and place tags. if the keyword is already exists, you can easily drag and put them out of the right side bar and place on the selection. as a result, a dialog where you're asking if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is selected on no sampling, and then there was a keyword from the right keyword on the selection and put it there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and notice that it would be a or his need, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a character set, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a comprehensive search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, only use the check box at the end of the rule and after the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've got it primarily on & digious; s specific implementation was adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colorless workflow is that, the colors come from your camera or scanner come with a colorable workflow. with a colorable workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor can print from your camera or scanner, or publish the colors that you want to print or publish from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is based on colour administration, everyone wants to press the buttons. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about colour administration. in addition, links with a deeper information allow you to make your own informational decisions to make you make the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image has been met all six listed below, then you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can be calibrated on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditure feature e-mail or web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well, and the life for everyone is so easy, why should one use another colour space so that thoughts would have to be able to imagine a color break?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting from sRGB in comparison to the colours which we really can see is presented at the bottom. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hugh-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger farms, then visit Bruce Lindbloom-ente side and click on Info and then click on Information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to install your monitor. so, your monitor closes down your monitor. if you are using the color space of your RGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections available which can improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, unequal, automatic and contrast expand from the menu-corrected automatic correction automatically from your colours. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaled through the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without his colorings. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adjusted the light factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity can be as flat as it is possible, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic cut: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright borders and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast expand: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of RGB values of a picture through the postpone of the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in selected images and may be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white off of & digious; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white comparison of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-off-correction is slightly limited because over a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which can perform in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will fall better to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white off algorithm by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. they start making it over the menu entry color white with the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original size, then it goes to the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the pixels of pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is indicated once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminant.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows adjustment lets you improve the shadow of your photos or down down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are used, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this knob and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use selected colour to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white off with the list of settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The transferring dictator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is overexposed. this will appear in a preview as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and charging exactly this. each setting of the white balance you can add to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be shown any other photo than your original. if you save this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time, and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be carried out through the bottom window for the use of color profilets you can drag the chapter management department.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color error correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always require the same error and you will always find the same error. in the manual for the audio correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool colour effects give you four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the image was produced, and after that the development of the image were completed. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase is finally possible to generate a negative image that is not shown on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and this (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it distinguishes itself from saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect from the colours brilliant and brilliant. try it simply, it's embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors for daylight and high contrast. Velvia offers very saturated colors for daylight photography. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photographs, especially those who are hardly able to finish, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on counteredges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the thickness of the neonlight. at large images, the filter can release the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and light intensity of the photos. you can review the various colour-bascks of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad light conditions, you can get a good choice: one too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will take a good choice for saturation instead. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools gradation and the simple leukintensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement of the coating. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of the slider. specifically the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slivers are clicked into the inside and the move can be changed to modify the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to postpone it is to postpone the control and change it as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the picture's settings. on the left-hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis is represented. for pictures of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram function is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweeters can be used in the preview of the original tape to automatically adjust the inputs of the shadow, medium and bright tones. Moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the output values as in the input rate. for example, the compression of output values can be used for example, to create a hidden image as a background, while something else in the foreground can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set upon depending on the intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: using these buttons, the set values in the file system are stored and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the inputs will automatically adjust for all shadows, medium and sun sounds. if you want to use the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original program for red, green, blueprint and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option indicators controls all the channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, so you'll get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image is indicated. the preview becomes dynamic in dependence on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this box box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese sticks there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode has a wide beam. in this case, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cesteil to the right, for example, the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are correspondent with dark outings and the corresponding image pixel are darker darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos you will see a red mark. if you change this marking on the area you want to change, the right line on the curve is displayed, and move a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: using these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve which you have created may be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format is Gimp Brief format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipettes buttons make automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the slate-, medium and sun sounds. disable the color pipette that you want to use and click the original image to set control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option codes are checked all the colour channels to display overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the Luminant channel. slate- and sun sounds was applied with the color pipette and applied on the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digipun; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shines of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the tones of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and impact. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you place these in the picture, a vertical line appears in histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to adjust these channels. if you are able to activate the appropriate colour. this is especially convenient when you use the option of monochrome, as the channel mixer then uses the tool for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from farbrauschen, which looks not in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion so you can reduce the farbrauschen first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then download. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option indicators controls all the channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, so you'll get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below, you can see a photo in which the blue channel was reactivated. the original image is activated (1) and the original image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white, a working step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. like the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orantes: simulates a black / white film coating with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orantes.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar shots to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotters.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the attack. this is quite similar to the process of exfoliation of a pressure and re-development in a sincereboner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the digiplug & digious; tool texture apply, you can apply decorative textures onto an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, irrespective whether it's a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a screen, the Stich of an old master, a pop-portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the length of the deep or three-dimensional texture of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text is applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified (2). the relief parameter is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Mounted with the digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the borders of a photo is not easy task. a possibility to keep its attention is to be a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under the frame the module can be started using image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. in detail the image with a colored line, niepce surrounded it with a wide and wide frame (ideal for black-and white images), it is ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the frame's width in percent. the value range is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This target is larger than the original, but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of pictures, especially when you have used the tool following the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a format text in any picture in any place. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the larger has to be the character set. at the end you simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the image is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK" after the image is stored once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the digiplug & digious; tool template, you can create a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture template uses in the image processing can be used to place templates across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should be adding to the file size of the template; if you want to add your stencil bank, you just send an e-mail in English to the digiplug; mailing list digiBOe-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the knob base for dialog. choose the folder where you have copied the template files. these settings are mentioned for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates has been released a project management which reflects the folder structure of stencil printer. the selection of a folder will update the template's templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">A preview of three buttons, which allows you to change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the displayed picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this knob shrinks the image below. if you want to turn the template on the whole image, you need to adjust the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to postpone the picture below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template on your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, grain pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Filtering mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. indeed, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it is a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Reproduction is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this means that sharp edges are combined with only minimal differences to a common color. the same phenomenon occurs when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequent sharpness than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures a camera has been applied to a camera. images in the shell format must always be tightened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners contact a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you deactivate this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpen a photograph with the sharpening value. this can be correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should get careful, since the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you will be focused on the menu entry. on the focus further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the image is slightly soft to draw. use the tool to adjust the switch with the menu entry and try something with settings. the default windows on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove sander from your photos. a demonstration can see you here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help view the image. the default window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values often generate good results and should be tried out at first. if you make the draw points to be strong, noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius sets up a number of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpened images at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the veritable image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the amount difference. it can therefore define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between tones of sharpenalties are avoided and therefore beautifull error in face, celulas and water surface are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the uncormasked filter. the original image is the (1) and the original image (2). unsharp masked was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; Tool Refocused focused on a picture due to improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected y-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to push a picture & quot; refocusing system. this is better approach as merely to try the photograph. it uses a technique called FIR Vibration. so, the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a visual acuity. reproduction, it can start from the menu by calling colors editing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauss's break. the Gauge's break has a very long tail, which makes the mathematical outcome away from the source pixel, which is far from the original quellpixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes undesirable findings in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unsharp, but you should pay attention to Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of the correlation can help artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. needed values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpened effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the robotic filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will continue to prevent image quality.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauge's sharpness. use this parameter if your fault-visual acuity. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you need a value of zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix size. however, an increase of the matrix size may produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the auss's sharpness. however, please note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary parameters will have set the set to be saved and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the trimming, color and intensity corrections to the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes are not visible immediately, but then left unpleasant artifact.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg, eg; when JPEG, you should compress the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unrivaled produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by a sharp masked bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it is necessary to generate unsharp bend. even under optimal conditions it is never able to remove the effect of the filtering. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filters are always at least as good as the FIR Viennese filters. the FIR Viennese filters are often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to an insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods to be used in digital albumen, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob provides the sharpness of the range of the bottoms in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows the adapted colour for the pupils. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The error correction tool is one of the undeveloped tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders Glättis and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail controls p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass above the picture. a value of 0.9 should then receive details so that no sharpening is needed. please note that the details should always be admissible.</seg>
<seg id="520">Dependency dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes even in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction only. if you will create a fine-cell similar patterns. JPEG Artefakte will be the best in a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value as the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter contains greater structures. the higher that value is set, the more is smoothed, since it is then hard to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular focal length [5, 90]: angle dependency of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, then it should also be small. be sure to create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and unacceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller than 2 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never higher than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the More on quality you will receive by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it therefore to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and charging exactly this. each setting of image error correcting to a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Visual error correction is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image error corrects with little artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was used in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug power supply; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter hedert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool can be selected image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moire.; effects of recorded photos from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">Screen photo above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained smoke that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the bottom window details and the bottom window advanced settings can stay with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel, and can be pinned by the radius indicated above the picture and the color in it is smoothed, and thus diminished smaller flaws.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sceptical seal. this value defines the pixel pitch of the filter to front. if it is increased, the adaptive filter image details can be reactivated. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot get more and noise or dirt occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire room can be removed or smoke peaks. set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminated tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothening process of the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothening process of the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the darker areas which typically are stronger, however, it is contaminated the slatted areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius appear on variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smooth, if it can be too high, can remove smoke and phasenjitter in the edges. it can remove smoke peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved in the file system and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how a noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected using (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution, the image is a bit soft, it is fortunately much easier than to sharpen it with the menu entry, and experimenting with the smooth menu on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digipcomes; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo acts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts about your images. it is very good adapted to remove juncture, film grains, kratom, compression bandage and local bugs which occurs in digital, original or later digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and therefore obtains the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. the text effect is carried out with another tool, the error correction method. the algorithm to restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannée and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct this problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and charging exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can be restored like a photo with equaling noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film fragments on the faces. the original image is under (1) and that corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, Texture was applied to an old colour photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifact that originates from the scanner lighting and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious; tool Hotpixel makes it a hotpixel of photos that have been used with a CCD camera, eight have been used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially a problem with high quality raw mode photos, since many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixquot; and "quot; light pixel quot; on a picture with a darkest subtractive method. there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darkening. the tool will recognise automatically the hot and bright pixels.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it's important to take the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD default.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described in the previous section, you should upload the matching dark image to the correct image. note here that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically reload this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture range and preview can help you corrected the result within the picture. the default window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted in all imaginable areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select a field to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. after that, select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel pitch. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: it is determined an average of neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective Pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from a pixel pitch are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel can be made to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug & digious correction is a tool to correct adjust the vignited corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, often allow the entire sensor sector not evenly light. instead & quot; vignetignenquot; (shady) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light onto the sensor. telephoto lenses also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be used with Center-Filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpening effects arise due to movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing areas of today's felt and colour camera, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is used without these filters, the transformation formula turns with a Centerfilter on an image. algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">In three shelves, you can control the correction of the vascular filter and add three other exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting from an optical filter with a aperture setting of 2, deplating the density to compensate a greater degree of vignant, to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukintensity, contrast and gamma settings: the edit of a picture with the vignant correction is reduced the luminance of pixels. they must readjust the exposure of the target image using these options, as you have to only increase positive values as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the coating of the target image, set the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma with zero and use the gradation of the & digipun; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignant correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the adjusted image in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a Leuchstronger and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colourings can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">Coefficient of the second degree is the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar check effect, but fleight on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">Coefficient below fourth grades corrects the remote corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion part. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of knee-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value is stronger than changing the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the "corners" has changed the parameter to the parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and therefore conducts a correction first graph. negative values increase while positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion parameter. the values can be used for your image, are stored and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or kissenic correction should be performed before all the trimming or size changes. the best result lead to cut this correction as all of them. if you have a picture of a picture and then it would carry out a tonnage of falsely.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you can find the best correction to you this tool is a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it into an important place, like e.g. the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a crust-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu. remove cut from the image processing or over the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some designs as pictures from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that, when you keep the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the Gimpguru.org webpage. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set up two parameters of film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the corresponding texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of the film grains and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red filmear based on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the original image has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of Aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer big silver-grains of the photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back in the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere out of everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photo, grained view, especially in your monochroms photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be required to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grains on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the original image (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious design; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a natural-protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious design; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and stills are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to affect this effect. the upper chooses the pin size between one and five. thick brush are better for large images. smoothing controls the smooth or, from the other side, the cretness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the image is marked with the (2) brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious power supply; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage collection. therefore, pictures whose gradients vary slowly, therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful when you imagine what scene you chose to sketch. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob choose the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter. the original image (1) and the modified picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3-D, as if it stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a simple structure, where color does not work the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monastic scenery.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allow the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the original image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion-effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the picture in cells and look it as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break this effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of visual acuity. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Rate: understand the image along star lines run out of a focus. this simulates the filming of a zooming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial infinity: caught the picture by rotating the pixel by a focus. this simulates the filming of a rotational camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: wipes the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera body. the object seems to be traced back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sequence: ignoring the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the filming of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographers, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnout filtering: wipes the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and brilliant soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütteleving acuity: imble the image by accidental shift of pixels and simulates the filtering of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent filthness: find the colour splash in the image and eared it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created by the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. they can therefore break this calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a nly look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the tropic size. since the sample size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image. number change the number and density of the drops. fish stock changes the optical effect of the drops onto the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing has a range free of rainy drops. use the choice of tools to select the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you then start the filter reropes the area will remain free from rainy drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropist Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo is the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transforming or transformate mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo noses is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to resizing is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture of the picture and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here, makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">When a photo is the wrong size you can modify it on the desired size with the tool size. select the transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to reduce the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. the underlying algorithm uses the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change size. these settings are available in the Rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Adjust aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained at the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter contains greater structures. the higher that value is set, the more is smoothed, since it is then hard to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Button Save as and charging are exactly used. each photo file can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what makes it, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after yourself. you can break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">Below you can see an example for photo bubbles by using a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the larger image (3) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only one frequently carried out operation, but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture. the mouse simply allows the rectangle with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and ascend the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you let loose the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut off. by doing so, you can change the size of the cut zone by removing the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle simply create it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button of the cutting edge button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save and File Recovery file to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the forestry area you can change the size of the rectangle by plugging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool fits into the aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use it or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and whose aspect ratio can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to address selected horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. relationship button in the area to cut the size possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">Depending on the aspect ratio, the tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, this settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data can reflect the cut-cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of the collectively helps help to induce your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party, harmonious triangles are an option to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is the pitch that is based on various natural growth models, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blasting leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we are as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, that use your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have the golden pitch in all times when you meet your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number leads from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two progressing. a composition of this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid auxiliary lines, when you assemble a picture. these furnaces are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-digit hedgehogs, the golden spiral line creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the rectangle of golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be used to give the golden spiral. it should be a line that the eye can be centered to the center of composition. that can be a line or different objects. it can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles have no equilateral triangles. diagonal to plazing these lines can be screened.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to open up your frame, you will try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that can't be achieved differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button colour you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adapt the colour of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things get around an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; image processing and tool-free rotation rotation. select the transformational Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button settings, you can reset the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module includes a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer to move the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a painting you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. an option to repair this is to utilize the function transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatically Cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option provides the picture a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out around a fixation point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. this preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: indicates the width of the new picture, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: indicates the height of the new picture, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: indicates the actual angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle at the top: indicates the actual angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: indicates the actual angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: indicates the actual angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be a bit dirty. for individual adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you fit the perspective, you get unbeatable triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to transfer this to some of the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transforming barriers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Adjust your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can specify horizontally and vertically. if you are using presets, the angle is displayed on zero. a preview of Effects will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the loop tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the calibration, this picture becomes somewhat negligible. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible but two chings produce twice as much disassembling and hence, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After closing the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. an option to eliminate this is the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write them. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries compile. in most distributions you will need a large number of image formats with & digipun; edit.</seg>

<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; open up the Graphene in & kgraphviewer; open in a & Kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading of large graphite (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than that nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & mgraphviewer; is a & kbit; -program that requires the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphs, each in a separate bottom window. at first, if you start & interviewer; without argument, the toolbar will open only the symbol file and the (empty) list last files opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot matrix files, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed, if the graph is greater than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mapped wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressing & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">When the straight in & interviewer; loaded file changes from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be re-loaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can your choice also notice, so you can change your decision later, you can make use of the menu settings kviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphic file outside a running & interviewer; -instance open, & eg; in file browsers or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kviewer; -instance, or want to open the graphics in a sub-window of the already current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice, but also change the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">With program start, you can re-open all graph of your last meeting. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph can be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose if the parts of the graphics that are placed on a page will enter this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages divided graphs without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The site again gives you the opportunity to specify the behaviour when a file has changed on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can define a default behavior (automatically reload or to ignore the changes) or the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page open is the possibility to define the behaviour of & kgraphviewer; specify if a graph outside of the current session is opened. you can open a standard behavior for this case (the graphs in a new window, or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that every time is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="747">The page seat management is the option to define the start behaviour of & kgraphviewer; you can set a standard behavior (the files of the last session or not) or determine if desired.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally comes with a click on the main window with the & RMBn; there are further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; -Layoutalgorithms. the entries as they are described on the web page of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -Algorithm, the standard for arising graphs. it produces hierarchical or stratified representations of straightened graphs. the algorithm uses the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce short edges and as far as few cantons.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unequivocals graphs. it produces representations according to the ski spring model. in this process, the Kamada-Kawai algorithm uses the same characteristic of statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a diving line layout for uneried graphite. it uses frustre-pure gold heels, and includes a multi-grid for the treatment of large and geosterling graphics.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm assigns the node a barrel in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. he is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout commands when using a shell command, and the calculated layout of the graphics to stdout in the xdot format. with such layout commands you can specify & eg; the graphics with a filter change, or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graphs (directed or undone) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for-oriented, & neato; for unpainted graphics).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is activated, the overview is displayed, if necessary, otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows what is -mouse pox. click on this mouse button to get a & GUI; element to get further help to this element (if available).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available under this address and in the file Changelog in the base file of the source archive.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphviewer; is a & kbit; -program that uses the & graphviz; tools for representation. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphviewer; in the menu settings you will find further options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the vest for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid screen, in which you mark the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Creates a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. afterwards, a dialog where you can choose whether the symbol of a template will be created, or if you want to restart from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Retracts the most backward step again. if you have no step back, this function is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="764">Add the contents of the clipboard as a new picture (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="765">Sets the current symbol in grey stages. this can produce colors that do not match with them the icon range of & kde; match.</seg>
<seg id="766">Does not change the symbol, but sets the current color to color of the point on which you click.</seg>
<seg id="767">The Status Bar shows you the current promotions. from left to right, you will show you the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixels, the size of the current drawing area, the magnification factor and the current number of colors of symbol.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module images can be used tools to redeem new pictures, and install them.</seg>
<seg id="773">For this module, this module can be used to redeem new pictures from external sources and can be used. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner which supports the sane project or another source like e.g. Video Streams. so that's how you have to install Kooka and sane.</seg>
<seg id="775">If you scanned the menu entry images, a dialogue that you can select between all available sources on your computer. choose here the source of which you want to pick up the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears that you can replace the default standard values to select your image before you start reading the area. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Note that the window will be completely displayed, because some settings can not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button scanning, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file. here, please remember that the type BMP is uncompressed and therefore very large files. you will also need to select the folder & # 160; or create a file by selecting the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen photos can be created after you choose from the menu of alizer &gt; screen photo... a window appears in which you can set the different screen photography:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop using a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows is selected, the access program will disappear, so that you can read other screens and windows. otherwise, you will read, after a short delay, the currently visible job. if you have chosen the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen photo is waiting until it starts. if you need to switch to other work areas, you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After screen photo, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the already described above.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows GPS coordinates into the metadata of a picture and edit the geographical data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the picture and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization, tools are available to locate images geographically in spherical coordination system which is used by GPS and Galileo to localize. height, longitudinal and latitudinal cells are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">In order to correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as a XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert from your GPS device to download and convert.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you'll need to upload a trace file containing GPX file, such as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, automatic correlation between the coordinates must be recorded in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera body must be converted with GMT. this can be carried out with the time zone. click here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera security. the deviation from below are the data collected and the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds is correlated to all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set this limits, and then press the button correlate to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog is to use the coordinates of a call to the next one, you only need to use the button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found on the shown map and after it can be found and enlarge. select the appropriate region and increase sie.Guide this until you have to be selected manually. the card may always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities the GPS data to hang onto the images. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module photo gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set will coding UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders to be adapted to the settings. the rider selection are allowed to select all albums that are exported to HTML. you'll need to select these albums in the area. in the area below, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenevolschau and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is created largely even explaining. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be displayed on the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kub Show, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your matching images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder containing the name KIPIHTMLexport, who contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you chose JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colors depth, you can change the standard color depth. this also influences the file size. all other settings are explained clearly.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider selection image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for watching pictures, which are shown small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press departure to break out the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module produces the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program reports to determine whether mistakes during generation. web browser is started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to connect the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and put on them basic operations such as shooting, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with dumbbell and labs. it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After launching, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without sacrificing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images listed below, images in JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size is increasing because there is no compression of the color information. for example, it can also be found at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-click is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-click is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these questions, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata editor currently features no documentation. if you wish to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a picture to another. select the image that you want to copy the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied immediately after you click the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy anywhere from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiers module can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packets of Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide-format. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD. for burning the medium you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the pictures which are packed in the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can start the module with extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of pictures or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to select the file on a TV, you have to default the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of image transfer is fixed among them. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt, it should be set in black. set the name and the path of the created file you can specify under the name of the MPEG output file. keep on the way as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. after you can enjoy all settings your wishes, you can easily drink with the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or in all rest a coffee and enjoy the slide once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">Printing assistent makes it possible to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photoformat. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g., to improve you or print using Gimp module to direct print.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert images stored in the RAW format to one from three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original score from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera vendors. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now optimize the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal to and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a dismiserable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your picture and uses the forceable LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you pre-edit your pictures or later you should not use the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before converting the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that are stored in the RAW file are stored in the file of the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode, therefore, if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the option to automatically overwrite the option. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview of progress is not available as far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to renaming all images of a album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or enlarge. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo set. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the selected pictures before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window with the selected images are displayed. you can add more images to you with a file selection dialog. for the recently selected image will be displayed a preview on your right page.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of the resulting images.</seg>
<seg id="875">Images of the selected pictures from the list of images are removed with the button images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you select all the pictures you can open the new message with the button OK to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you have to add here the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Please do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of posting e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and every time you use it until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you'll need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you need to install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a fixed file, the comments can be added to the images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted below the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore have PNG if you don't have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures in file format and then select the original files in JPEG format, then the original file data will be added to the affected pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can watch the status messages, on the search for errors, however. your e-mail program is started automatically at the end. with the knob you can read this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the start of the Moduls' slide show a window with questions as you want to have shown your diashau. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation are using very elegant image processes using OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file extensions option provides that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>

<seg id="917">& kfully album, gives you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the User's book, the integrated version described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described above the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the passage and a description that the HTML file should be included later. on a cool album; HTML-example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & cool album; -Export file will be created, which is to be seen on the visible page. ferry information about export files will be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. so, you can avoid that information are displayed on the HTML pages. for example, all pictures are from a party. for example, all pictures are exported. you can not use this setting to hide specific images before certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most importing options are clearly, why this is not specially developed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. this allows you to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images download that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer at your side can change the resolution at any time. it allows you to browse your pictures with a low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if a picture is bigger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area you place the various folders and the URL that your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be stored and automatically added for all future images to the location. here you can select either a folder or by KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this really select all the viewer. if you have created for the basic folder a web browser after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files created not yet in the final destination folder you need to set them manually. in order to specify the import function, see, right, you need to specify the final destination of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folders in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described setting possibilities have related all three on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder created, whose name is set in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking for a family party, a meeting or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbums; you can naturally create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. if you already have already spent a lot of time, the image information, people on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & cool albums; this work will not even make them once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & cool albums; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import them to your database. the image features are being imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file or whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether you have all the images stored in the file, that you may have all the images and put this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, it will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for pictures in two times. first, the images that are displayed in the folder of .kim file. if you don't find the corresponding pictures, the images of the URL that you have created when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible when you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export Pictures will be described, which you can call on the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. there are you the following three options:</seg>
<seg id="938">At the option manual, copy the .kim file, you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim-file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically to copy the .kim-file copying & cool album; the pictures will automatically be used for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG format, and the XML file itself is quite small, it usually doesn't want to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page contains maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, please don't want to limit the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would be quite large. here you can specify the size by saying that every image will be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">After you can select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file implict... select & cool album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select what pictures you want to import them, afterwards, in which file the import them to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can find the category people of imported file personer (if you are a Dis), while this category is called for your database. so you will be asked to be imported in the third dialog box which are to be imported into your database and which categories these categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can see the categories of imported file using the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and view: when you see images, you would like to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you might want to see all the pictures where this boyfriend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) of the information on your images, over (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">This photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures but frequently, this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& cool album; saves all his information in the file thx.xml in the upper folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& cool album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future start automatically. if you want to start a different database with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start playing & cool album; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings menu, set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; you can change the settings in the following section of the user book.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different icons with which you can call settings of preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call for the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can define for any image, such as people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On the dialog box, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned in detail. in the dialog options, all members of a group allows you to set up all members of a group once in a group instead of all groups of one member.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view you can select the setup options available to you to the fixed list box. with the above selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kfully album; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface. wet information please find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & cool albums; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with each other applications, it can be used to test new modules with the demo database before using the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or on the menu. do not say, I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules above KIPI, are very different, so it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbums; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbums; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other uses does not support their images in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order to records, so that you can use the functions with & cool albums.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here's simulated & cool album; the current record, which is simply the current view, so all images that shows you the picture gallery.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbums; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & cool album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then every record of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category which you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, so do you want to use the category persons, so do if you have selected persons to have selected and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are equipped with & kphotoalbums; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select the modules, which are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen, once you & my photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed by any other KDE application, see the top of a menu and a toolbar. under the toolbar, you will see the window below. in the section we will not find information on this window, but now click on the entry images, which shows you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbums; is the possibility to view any picture with comments on the picture where the picture was taken on. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images as shown on all pictures of Jesper and recorded all the pictures in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsers, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you can set three lists with a text box by providing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbums; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to transfer the images within the list: if you have a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be seen, so that the used names are moved back to top, the persons can find quickly and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetical list of the list, click on the icon for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image, you might need to edit all selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes. click in this case simply on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, you can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to one note with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the United States as an overgroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the attentive dialogs is possible to add a entry into an existing or new subcategory. additionally, you can also use a entry to a category and put this entry into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you just need your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of attentive dialogs by connecting the edge, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by drag him out of the window section.</seg>

<seg id="981">You can also finish a frame as well. if you want to show this window later again, use the button options... and then windows 1 / off. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser you will get a glance with showing images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you don't have filters. for example, you can configure the size of the spectacle, simply plugging in the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply time.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you make a picture in the background of your desktop, this image will be set for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is shown in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview photos. simply select the appropriate pictures you want, and press either the removal button or select in the menu edit menu. now you will display the window you can see in the picture.</seg>

<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. for the pictures 5-9, however, the pictures are present, so & cool album; you can see the preview of these images. however, you can't watch these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature you need to copy files from folders and copy it again. if you do not want to avoid problems of the appropriate CD. if you wish to avoid trouble shooting, please buy a larger hard disk to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you will filter the pictures so that you may see for other unaccessible in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister, check out and choose the menu entry everything except for current view.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be installed properly. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Renders Symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry scene scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add as many Render modes, from a quick preview up to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings click on the toolbar or in the menu version Render modes..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can set any name any name, but a name that can recognize the properties of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you like only a small area of the image, select the check box section and give the image section to renders in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that use & Povray; for renders. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser Reflexions Lighting. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in User's manual or Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered by pixel per pixel, various mistakes may be created. these pictures often have a Moirè-pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general pictures see images with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculates & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is increasingly split up and adaptive because each pixel is increasingly split up and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values is exceeded, then both pixels are calculated using a specified number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated additionally, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) extra beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the distinction is divided between the colour values, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be pursued individually and adjusted to further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, it changes and Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest attitude for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is a experimental feature of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>

<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the Editor Text Editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can add source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, if & kpovmodeler; a scene will be human. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better brushcutter for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high quality assurance for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, a floor will drop below the objects. the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross edge deposits, the non-recursive non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling levels can be adjusted. accurate information about parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window of window the window can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard Procedure: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window system in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of Extant windowns shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the button adding and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window of window is identified by the name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen windows order. new views can easily create and remove selected views on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with box card you will receive a cartcard view together with the previous view and pending the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without more specific knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should easily create the ultimate, but very popular among beginners: one ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain about it as a result of only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to renders, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you'll receive only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any fault-free, you see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll need to use these menus and symbols right now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry edit. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene, which you generate. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the object properties, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in user documentation on & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later different lines, but note that the camera will change in the view point, with which you can change the camera off the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input button, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately after these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might add a quader (insert endary body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a nonsense method of solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input button. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is now also the plain, even at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will notice that you click the entry options for each new object. in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. choose a shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only select the floor to stop its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something very Simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue where you can select how the object will be inserted. please choose first accommodation. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigments), with a click on the button preview, like the pigments looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a sheet black material, because you have settings for your pigments. do you always remember to check the look of materials anytime with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but now take you the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and ball, click on the button button and then call a preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the Farben. you are expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more often, but the Schachbrett-Farbenlist can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the property tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run, since you should have understood the basic working number of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: at 1 (do not forget to push the input button or the button to press), so that the ball might drop down with the ground. otherwise, you would have moved the ball over the floor, as you move the floor down a unit down below.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a rare result: as soon as before, the ball surface appears like a sheet black material. set the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to you. as in the bottom, enter the ball a pigment in color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first object and change the name for example in ball pigments. click on ball pigments, then select Insert and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve an interesting effect when you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection, already partially good visual effects, perfectly suited for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: still not selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what are possibilities to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have already learned how much you can create, but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When using a scene raytracing, the rendering of the hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects scenes) is reflected in the scene, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as the atmospheric effects, such as fog impact. so the scene will process pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can also see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some lighting sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you have created before using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to add or add new commands for & kpovmodeler; commands or new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to setup the toolbars. you can add using this option toolholder for & kpovmodeler; -commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a possibility to specify rough surfaces, without any diffraction in the surface and to change without the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms which can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programmes and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example of Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. this reason, scripts are going to monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to save the storage and loading of the setup data, each script must take care of each script itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now be & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumetChange High volume signals an amendment of the volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize MenuClicked: Submenu, Subject the path to the selected files of playlist, if a custom menu entry can be identified. in order to add an own entry, you can use dcop amarok script, eCustomp amarok script, eCustomMenuItem (submenitemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do for example, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are additionally compressed to bzip2 (.bz2), which can also recognize the archive with bzip2 (.bz2) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended amarokscript. this is why you should rename your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main crept must be executable (+ x), the rest of the modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assumes that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesec.org. for example, Fluxbox is ready for example. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because they provide excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1260">That's easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired file. then drag the files to the right part of playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the surface intuitive, the start-window is converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioTraditional; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the read of & CD; -data in WAV files on the hard drive) and from many codiers used to encode these WAV files (This code packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more Kodiers can be added to the program (if installed it have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and compress in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Are usually compressed to WAV files in a second step (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, is used by & kaudioeil; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package, if this is not yet installed, this must now be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, advertisement (for MP3), oggpre-to (for OGG) or other Kodiers have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile yourself. however, only the code packages are not needed to compile. if the FLAC does not use it, its installation is not required.</seg>

<seg id="1501">A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudioviews. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protection is not possible to avoid any copy protection. in any case, it is not possible to avoid protected audio CD; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While adjusting for one time only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found until a suitable configuration is found), after reading a daily handling of a & CD; this leads to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of user interface, which you will often arrive at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudioCreator; with different map cards (such as Encoder, for adjusting the Encoders). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coils and compression ratios and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercials that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats supported by data compression depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG mag now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame will be free with most distribution options, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrate), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at a deeper bitrate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - If only music will be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-players are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer to most people and most music pieces acceptable, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music from young people, portable devices and autostereogram. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the highest quality without return to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually entered or by the program automatically from the FreeDB via the Internet are available as a list of parameters. you can commit / needed / needed with & audiophthalating; and the code program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there are often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or assistance to the codiers explain the switches on these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title Parameters of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiophthalating; parameter which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB is: a free database, where people can download / enter audio CDs, so that all the other information can be downloaded from myself on your computer. it is to be aware that only texts by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm) isn't attorney. however, nobody can publish the information on the & CD; more or less value less, so can neither the artist nor the music company harm. all information can be preserved in a bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioviews, you can use a check box (sending an address) to the use of FreeDB. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used when calling the server (This can only know the programmer, who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & audiophonic use; for the use of FreeDB, the geographically is to be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and equates the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org provides a current list of mirservern for the online retrieving of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; or alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updating the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more precise, searching in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see. note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the WAV files, the code format can be selected for advertisement (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a forceable compression for audio data) on the tab. other code can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined code of code. more information on Kodierer are listed in the chapter space code.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a body, further information can be obtained via his switches using the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). advertisement 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read performance of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that may indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell & CD; and this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step for example. even if you use other settings, this will give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the whole manual, all understood, but somehow still lack anything to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to make those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything one setup and our first & CD; we'll be able to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps, on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as a compiled package for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for advertisement can be found as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source file, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy it with the counter).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudioviews, something which probably will be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what a phrase and CD must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the defined code for compression of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy to use the FreeDB program to download the & CD; data from the internet are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will probably do it at any reading & CD; change once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the selection program to read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, a view into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map displays General Settings. here you can't do much. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be sent / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information, select that you will be informed when information is missing in keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and release the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the read of the & CD; connected to the Internet that he can connect to the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are later unhappy with the database post or file names, it can be easily changed. the directory or file names can be changed with Convenient - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter all manually, the select fields and FreeDB is not used. however, it can be used with FreeDB locally in offline mode. however, these can be selected using FreeDB in offline mode, the two selection areas must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the data on request for calling the & CD; information from FreeDB server on the Internet. how do I know the system which data to get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. do all this as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we only want to use the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freed.org page and look at a mirror server near you. on this way, the load will be distributed between the host computers. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as equal to the server, because many firewalls date the protocol of 8880. maybe more happiness with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data on the FreeDB server. the first check box should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously read pieces: excuse, there is why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel, reading and codile? the author doesn't know it, therefore just try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you cross this file, then the path / folders must be stored in which the WAV files are installed. if the box cannot be crossed, the files are not installed in the private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to do anything with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything just enter as it is on screen photo. the command is a bit long, under conditions you need to be blotted to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is 6.3 - 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of generating tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside these sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a dualcore or square or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioPlay; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never have to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the & CD; it is described in the previous section. first, the folder structure is set up, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from FreeDB must be found in the previous section. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each additional & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we contain a & CD, which is not yet included in FreeDB, see the screen photos a little different than the data for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieve it from the Internet. comments may refer to differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD now; into the drive which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and length in the window should be listed as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up from FreeDB, all tracks are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can select the database-associated entry, which makes your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query of FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings dialog for the settings) you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, but the data from the Internet, you'll need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo one. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered anymore in the input field 'Current title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments iniatell each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments on all pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the FreeDB file, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to make the contents of the CD-editor, so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. all words with uppercase letters or not...), but also to verify if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what's tab. this option is set up on the KodiererSettings menu; take a look inside the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see Help for Kodiers to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which is obviously with the style of the chosen CD; this is not important since we do not transmit the & CD; -data just why go to the web site of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the election of 'OK' come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already covered with the entered data, which we have for the first piece. simply enter the entries in the fields of the current piece in any case and other information that you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB file. it is already available in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the unit list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-in front of each row of a piece. only the titles that are selected as selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select all the pieces select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection check out the window process started, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you are trying to work with a code of code that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the output of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to format MP3. therefore, read and encode in parallel. note the status review in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour. the only thing configured is unclear, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the calculator with a AMD64 appears to read and encode at the simultaneous interpreting (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the waiting line of the body. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message will be embedded in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioviews, you'll need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudioPlay; if you know with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. however, most distributions contain a pre-compiled package, da & kaudioeil; a part of an important & kde; package. if you read it, you probably have done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at individuals that compile of source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for searching for your needs, if it works once again, the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations on settings. best read the step by step for the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event; others use lyrics contexis and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be represented and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you need to set up a song, so that you do not need to adjust it manually. but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event type, select from the menu setting the entries of text or song events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these will be played in line after you. in this section, how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point.... Click there to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the winnings in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection you will get all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you must add a song in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. it appears again the file dialog where you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select the series after the sub-menu entries of the menus, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be set again.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collection manager or use the select list about the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the record next song from the menu or press the arrow arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song back to jump, select the button 1 piece, the entry preceding piece from the menu or press the button to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To erase a collection, open the collection manager, select there the deleting collection and click the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter if they are saved by & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus always separates trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the respective file (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which stores all the required modifications for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear so often as desired. it is, however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END and KEYMAP "A further keymap.... END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that it is needed to display that one section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer devices which are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use will look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the DC sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM cartridge are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you must not change the order so as well as no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-keysTo M is used to place all sounds that does this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your Keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you may take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a defective surplus. for this purpose, please bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (defenses), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum-patch of the patch, in which every tone represents a different percussioner instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not such that means the sound level of the always same drum (such as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their presence. they need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keychains for every channel and any instrument. you only need to use various keychains in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keychains are used mainly to form sounds on the pertinsions channel. take a look at the supplied keyword.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to control some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, you can simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap must be ignored by the name's name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkussions Patch on the Perkushima channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitchbenderratios are multiplied, in which ratio of pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only redirected. the value 4096 is used to make any decimal number in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM gives that a keyboard that will play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards up to one octave can be played. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these pires you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to show that no longer uses the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view of the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD shows the speed to be played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you like to find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it. it contains the music, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same score in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, i can't necessarily stay, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB. (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without any AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example of kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before sure, activate the option Automatically Add Collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow button on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the reproduction. in order to restore the standard tempo, click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & conqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a Karaoke file) or labeling (if I want to play a Karaoke file) or I want to play a file, only change to the & conqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once you want to add directly to a collection, click the automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">For example, suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. only once you want to play the first file. so you will set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then follow, also B.mid and C.mid play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animates me that, continue to program & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; Laga (Spain). at the moment, I'm interested in my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies. as Hobbies, I'm thinking program of collecting MIDI files, music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge anticipation when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. you would like to send a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to receive a MIDI file, but you should contact me as I maybe already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; fully written in my leisure and didn't get some money for it. I want to do so, because when I get back messages of users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you'll need to compile & kmid; with the parameters MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it works as if you would have any sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu Bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, that should be played according to each other, you should use the Category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchchair. if you meet a entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and play begins with the indicated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and infinite playlist can also be changed, but also through the application itself. however, the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer, can also be changed through an editor, but also through the application itself. through the click of a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu with playlist and selected either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at the starting and ease can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / ml .xml and / / .kde / reit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at Starts does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate the opening of another source. however, this would be the end of animation, however, the user can stop the application for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation may be the display of a favorite photos: "Meet" / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" Meet "/ lt; / bodysuit; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a Rider on configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as the one 'flash' with the module swfdec-Mozilla will be played here:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; even the special field can be inserted for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; 'flash' can be used in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The counter or & kmplayer; is in a console application to search and after error messages related to charging the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a given backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phono should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play anywhere from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the scanner should be used to use and the TV channels can be set manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box is to be found in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be selected ports which will be selected. for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name is probably a DVB to it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from kmplayer can also use only XVideo (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also necessary to work on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux extension must be functioning for the X server in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, by KMPlayer for the sources different names are used. at the time of the emergence of these documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvd source, pipesman, tvsource, source, vcdsource and vintsource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are you aware of how I can make my CDROM drive, if I play from it (not by the VCD file: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root after adjusting the device. it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why must every time my CPU have to be checked for their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1800">Independent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be saved, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new model, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a template using file New will be replaced by other data (such as name or character encoding). these variables can be adjusted in Settings... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables will be replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ customer class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that therefore linked articles in the editor. as soon as the document was created in this way, the following steps can be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, use the own template instead of the standard area.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files can be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and can be executed under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be carried out in the menu tooling directly from & cile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its kind of vision should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; you can walk there directly with the reading of the chapter from & Kate editor.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command set, which can be called for the menu of the LaTeX Reference. you can also find an evaluation description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use can also be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with hidden Ctrl button to eliminate the & tex; meaning that this way is balanced by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Many assistants have to agree on. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu image will allow the jump to the native or last jump brand. in this case, this trampoline stamp is emphasized automatically, so that they will automatically check in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processing is probably one of the main aspects in using a program like & kile; although great importance has already been made, in & cile; important functions for the writing of a & latex; source code may be added; special commands for their selection. under editing, the following commands are contained in text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">A complete section of (group of lines consisting on both sides contain an empty line). this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines (as in other textbox). this extended importance include in & kile; it is therefore that the stock is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection has also extended the word under the current curing position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also & latex; -commands with a surface finish (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For reading a part of the document, of course, the keyword Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers its own commands for a faster result. under editing, the following commands are contained:</seg>
<seg id="1820">This is a complete paragraph. the definition for a subsection in & kile; is contained in the description on processing exhaust gases.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been revealed that environments are a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for further orders under editing environment for easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of current surroundings (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the order to open the area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of current surroundings (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the order to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located in front of or within the command\\ begin {Surroundings}, the end of the environment is injected (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many, ambient commands, the view can be lost rapidly. this command shut down the last environment, so that the variable ambient structure is not broken up.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by clasps...}. under editing TeX group are some important commands that meet from processing surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the weakest clammer.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closing plate.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the weakest clammer einer & tex; -group # is, becomes the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many disappeared groups parentheses can be lost quickly. during this command, the last group completed the last group, so that the missing structure of the & tex; groups can not break down.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple beginnings as genes are used in & cile; the sign is used for two simple beginnings. also for the end of the beginner, the sign is used. & kile; however, you know this case and for two close beginner signs to & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double beginners can be set up under Settings... LaTeX - and off-off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific adjustments (e.g. wet or French) and that German or French courses are used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When fitting the Shift; Enter requires & kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), the current position within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), but not only one line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although and Kate; already a good source code completion, this was added in & cile; for special commands (usually for and latex;), three are used for automatic processing. all these modes can be adjusted for automatic processing. all these modes can be adjusted for different workplaces under settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment through the command\\ begin {Surroundings} is & kile; automatically add the command\\\ 'area} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the check box is removed, the last letter of the input is removed, and therefore, the list can be scaled down. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from a command. alternatively, you can also jump jump to these positions by means of editing disk brand Neighborough jump brand, and the required parameters will be available.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; setup... kile; digestive settings are made for these lists. there are possible variety of words for example & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as additions of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not suitable for the completion of environments. it is always used to have a large list with\\ begin and the call for the fulfilling mode is used to provide a large list with environmental conditions. on the other hand, the environments are often used so often that & kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the fulfills conditions or the touch-mode Alt + Shift button, the order will be automatically frozen and it appears\\\ {. after that, the ambient temperature can be continued and the environment will continue to be completed and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & cile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is used.</seg>

<seg id="1979">A view in which the edition (as shown in HTML) will be shown in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the monitor, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it divides the Plugin to listen to debuggy claims. this promotion is used by default, which will be used by default, so that a debugger must not be counted as standard.</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, A & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the Featuoguoges, the & quantptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing as a folder. you contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag file carry the name of the writing language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and clarifies if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information on working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter covers every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tagonal document. it can contain only once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a single element guy above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it, attr &gt; is the function of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check only at the download of the TagXML files in & quantitative aplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML file. the file name for this TagXML file should be schematic day.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can set up with settings... to be created. click on New action on the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion has been assigned shortcut. with the button user button, a key abbreviation can be assigned; with Kone the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be entered into the determinated settings, and in execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see below below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful promotional type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or as input (or portions of the document). themselves are the Schnellstart-Dialogue or the various See in... promotions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter can be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% script.dat file in the command line: global scripting folder: $KDEDIR / German / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file it is removed from the document's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative aplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script of & quantaplus can be determined; input field input can be determined by default settings, which is to be sent to the default value. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the specified application can also be redirected. there are two types output: normal edition, on the standard output edition; error messages, which should be done in the default output edition by default the value is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you'll need to add promotions and configure settings. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start processing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the date of attributes and you are planning your use, activate a dialogue "tag" when available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. due to the use of green (green is usually faded, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signalized a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start-day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol there must be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is set, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and continue using other tags, so it's still that, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantaplus; functions for the toolbar or it should be adjusted to better view through several dividers in several groups. open the tool-toolbars dialog for settings toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (top left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the Elementary, that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to access a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will choose it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the dividers support the group. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right file. after NeueXML does not exist, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your tool bar (s) so that their tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen enlargement of the & quantaplus; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like. this is why I describes a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to make an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -Language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to treat the second section here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc] .pfad, relative to this file, for example, PHP 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for this documentation, e.g. PHP 2, tag3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec.2, tag2, tag1 = html 2 html day 2 = day 2.html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, # Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = .html... Language Reference = basic syntax,... basic syntax = long-age.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistent with the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & and lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative aplus; sources of resources will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of the content is the range of the docrc file that is to be indicated for the context of a text and pressing of Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context List (ContextList) and the file extension lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and according to $HOME / .kde / German / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta /</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the resource (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or else to whom are sent. at different places, there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool-toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantitative aplus; users will be reviewed and only available when our team need them as correct and used for the release. to ensure a useful contribution, it will ensure a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources are guaranteed, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their own GPG key (the Pasdonhrase is not stored), or in the case you have multiple keys, you may have a look out. in the dialog New resource you need to check out the input fields (URL-preview can remain empty) and with click OK the uploading can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can instantly upload the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool-toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, still before installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems it warns and it can be interrupted. if the integrity is given and the resource is accurate with signature, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that is currently not yet made by & quantaplus; but creation can be time consuming as hundreds of tag files in daily XML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and conversions of DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep file.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & attaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative aplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter has to be able to accommodate these concepts with these fundamental concepts. this chapter provides them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative aplus; little use of use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction applies to a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; it is possible to secure what is marked as globally, in the joint file structure of & quantitative aplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different workpieces, actions and samples in the global tree, which are then available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements present a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user list, so that they can use only these users personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this can be done by & CSS; -patterns up to tool-fittings specifically for the files of a particular project. all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project, which emulates the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editorial window, the construction manners, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please go in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as close the current, other or all cartoning, unloading, erase or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation, such as fundamental processing steps (cut / copy / inating), editing the mouse under the mouse indicator, or open the file, if the string under the mouse pointer indicates a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors are the toolbars of the editor. currently, the number of equipment is shown; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars are shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert it, then click the icon that represents the day, then click the icon to insert several attributes (such as anchor), if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you may fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building managers (QIT;) allow it to navigate to the information on & quantitative view; to navigate to open and walk through. in the display with cartons stand for files, project, pattern settings, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction manners are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantitative tool; this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or delete the files from storage medium to be done with the following text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative aplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web page & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on the & quantitative measurement range. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script. through the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script will start to edit or send with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on the element, the cursor is placed in the document to the element of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and collection of the tree is opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with it you can change large attributes and namesp. that enables the content-oriented injection system allows changing of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for the quantitative view; you can create your documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be specified, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes pioneers at the lower end of the window, can be reached via the usable information: the News window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about any in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the mistakes in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such that there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantitative aplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with an email; sends the toolbar as a compressed tar archive over & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure them in & quantitative; like any other back and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. it has autoconf a number of options to get connected to the configure script. to configure a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the starting of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is in front of its bin folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML; editor began to address the development of & quantitative; what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible Markup languages would like? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to clean & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized, if one can define it in & XML; then it should be the appropriate & IDE; therefore, the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based on anything else? thanks to the & kde; -rumor is not only this possible, but allows users and developers, & quantaplus; how to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Glaplus; allows Webdevelopers to increase the use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand productivity almost every task. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars can be realized by using any script language exchange rate.

<seg id="2125">When wire Bookmarks in the current file, they will be appearing together with the entries prior or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, after filenames of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Search the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows to copy graphic files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantitative aplus; projects you will find details.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantitative aplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but as with each open source project developers can always use help. if they want the & quantaplus; development in financial shape, you can find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed on top of the project, as for example, after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift; F7 project project Properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to remotely access local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you use this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote control system, it may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this file should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and standard toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this file should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. when used in serverance scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="2164">Skips when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted. if a project is started on new, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will be displayed all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by anhaken or, through removing the hailed, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be easily upload in the menu with project Properties in the menu window profiles or with the key abbreviation Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder are possible), which will be re-read in project folders such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, even files listed in .cvsignors are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about projection views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger-Plugin can be configured with the options button. in case the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom window profiles and uploading profiles can be set (see in), as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, pointer an own building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the bottom window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see for details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event event event configuration, one can change event action and add these actions, change or delete. event actions will be executed if a previously specified event will enter how about the sickles of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, the movement is opened: the last project, which was opened, can't influence this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, open Project.... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative aplus; changed files will find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behavior is as well, however, the entries are missing and open with... in the right mouse pop-up menu (text menu):</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">For removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blown off to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and forget to program the program. this option is useful if you need to upload files and that is rather unsafe password on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog when you change your opinion from loading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">The project (or part of the project) can be uploaded to different servers, so that the project (or part of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. during editing or creation of a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that will be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally this must not be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can not be read easily, but everyone can see it easily in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simply changing the view, several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views on the project or the project toolbar, can be stored or deleted via settings of the toolbar toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative aplus; to its own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best over the menu toolbars. use and adding to the best. adding toolbars are treated down in the Section Add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set up either by means of the Context menu (right click on the toolbar), which can be set up in the new action, a new toolbar, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries will be removed and action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up menu toolbars and set settings to them in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially interlink, code cutters and files for the link. & Tubaplus; used templates as a usual filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or every system existing in the predisposing space. templates have put in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that not pure text is. it can insert any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are normally added in documents through cabling (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documentation. based on this templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to efficiently. some examples may be found under global templates. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful, if not a new document must be inserted again on a template but the same text area always back into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the storage room under global templates. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates. you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantitative methods.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a documentation structure according to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template save the local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, notice that (even if there was a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily moved with pulling and off on the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The compilation of binaries templates is simple: the file is only going to copy into a folder file. you can use all file management functions for it, like pulling and add or insert through the File Tree by Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files construction manview to create a folder on a folder and secure a Site by default, but of course it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal oriented approach-wise. you can create headlines and footer with & PHP; create, insert files or connect to them. in addition, some things can connect to using templates in projects very deep greenish.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the bottom window template is based on the files in $KDEDIR / German / apps / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behavior of a folder in the template list with the right mouse button to click the folder and in the context menu characteristics. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is unsealed, once elterous attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and adapts for everything except for the regular folders. if a regular file would be specified, it would always be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, it is probably in a regular file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to print or deleted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and enabled the headlines with special headlines / footlines to equip the headlines with headlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, use the Context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Glaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source editor that are accessible via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor through the VPL; editor and the second divides the editorial windows into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites a document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and when needed to source code editor, in which the implemented changes in the VPL file can be seen in source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP. there is no plans to modify this behavioural code.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchron is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure stops the active cursor from a window to others, where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; view can be adjusted between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation is automatically set to set the period. in general, the recommendation: a small range for quick computers and a large pot for slow use.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the documentation of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is also possible, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this enables the reduction of the system code. this enables you to change:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-Tags allow storage of information about the document themselves e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows the changing of the inhale, such as keywords on column names and keyword keyword # 2 on the main page.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list, or delete a change via the list is exactly how in the meta-elements possible. the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to integrate a external CSS-style by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is as used in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is independent. the marking works as usual. lyrics can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by intilt and deleted by pressing button or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way about the toolbars, such as in the source editor,. it is to be noted that the insertion of tags have already been removed already existing, e.g. an anchor day, which is inserted by text, must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars as the tables assistant or the lists are disabled. they will be used in & VPL; they will be used in the & VPL; in this release the tables or lists are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of stylistic installations. in contrast to other programs for stylisteners, the search for certain elements can be pursued and the execution of the silent environment can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributor had changed many changes and at the same time had changed the retrospection. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in combination.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program showed me only the changed lines, I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there were no hints to the places where perhaps only the retrospection had changed. the result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display the differences in line and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of more useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, just copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A feature that made much work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-done file browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way assembly is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of body and changes. the original file (the base) helps to edit conflicts. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can view the result directly. the screen photo shows three Quell files at summarizing:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps to compose the same and merge folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder summarise:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and thinks of the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain amount of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble anymore, if any one changes the backdrop.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then shows the color that the file is different. red color indicates that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily get the typing work by using only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder, folder 2, diff3 folder, file folder, diff3 folder, folder 3, diff3 folder, folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual inputs of file names, the selection via the file browsers (file...) or select a last modified file from the opening list. if you want to specify the file for the next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you use the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the Button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge folders will be selected for B and C, but then use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If interaction is crossed, the input field is active for the objective and process it. however, it is not necessary to specify a output file. you can also finish this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge guide.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. when opening, you must not select files, you can simply connect the dialog with the button button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and place: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and leave it over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions. if you want to figure out how these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would just need to copy two corresponding files, and then compare and compare these relevant sections simply, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove anything from & chdiff3; only the case sheet text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and place of text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such cases your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info lines of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C has a different color. (if the path is to a file for a while. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color that distinguishes itself. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is clearly visible in the next Section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and commentary, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks enabled, the line will be checked at a broken rows.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below comparative sequence star) also has an Info line with the inscription issue:, the file name and [encoder] if you have edited the result. usually it contains the automatic merge text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, Save deactivates!!! (use the buttons sprints to rest / unsolved conflict in order to find any remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference is necessary to have a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows, where the group is not visible in the windows. this group will then be highlighted with the colour background color for the current area, and each on the left shows a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic intermittance or by manual editing, no further line stops in the group; this text is displayed in these lines; no line in the case that you might change your opinion, and perhaps again choose another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, still in a mark which you might want to copy and take elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; checks, however, appears in the clipboard if you copy to this text from the result window. go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if in case of selecting the sources do not ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will be mainly used with the image running and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard buttons on the left, right, right, down, side down, end, end, Ctrl-early and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the overlent column next to the vertical frame bar can be inserted directly to Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to the edit. use the Insert button to switch between insertion and overdrive mode. (default setting is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the intermittent columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of the group (as already mentioned in section Merging and the edit window window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture backwards / Ctrl-picture backwards) or to the next / previous day conflict (Ctrl-picture backwards / Ctrl-picture backwards) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all unsolved conflicts has to be considered a conflict. therefore, they must be distinguished between soldered and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this is activated, it will always be copied into the clipboard. if this option is careful, because you could write the content of the clipboard automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling lines are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX-based systems use a return feed sign\, and Win32-based systems do not use the line-replenishment\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line-up of the source file, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored during the next start. (menu entry level &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (in some systems the dialog can also use variable width options, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in recursive scriptures are displayed. if the chosen book does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed individually. on these systems, the button settings will automatically be an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the tab character button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the import of the previous row will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, all selection will automatically be copied into the clipboard. the manual copying to the clipboard will then be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first step, all of all identical lines can be ignored in the source file. only during this first step, white characters can not be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. also in combination, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car replenishment '\' at the end of a line, others, however, could only look identical with different sizes in side-an-side comparison, though they may vary differently, but if this option is activated, it will be deactivated, however, this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled. changes in commentaries are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively looking for smaller differences, the option is activated in default. it is effective in complex and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-shift mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next restless conflict is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source. (default setting is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are not important in many files. if you only use conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or ignore C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning and merge folders. take a look for details below documentation on the list and merging of merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version of the Suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of user interface. this option does not include the current running program. you need to exit and restart the change. (this option is activated in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally about the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, all entries are used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding is a brief reference to what the local encoding is. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences such as special characters described and interpret. since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files with different coding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing order, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can handle 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the changes of changes in white characters in text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or ignore C / C + + -comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -r; C is displayed next to normal nor a second overlabound column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply change the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">In order to list the comparison window each other or overanother. this option can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files. current file summarise together when you use only two files. a simple click starts to restart the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as a pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the recently used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your needs. for example, you can use this function, or correct or correct use.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command (see above), then the output of command is used only at the line level. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable more flexibility when adjusting the diff-findings. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program this anymore. however, the good news is that in most cases sed and perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this precreprocessing command to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\\\\ 1 /\\\\\ 1 /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1). the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioncontrol systems use some key words to insert automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you may be able to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example of another pre-processing command for Zeilenabt. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'every character between' ['and'] 'is a relevant, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several actions at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the translations of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different such as perl -e -e -s / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings at perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merge. other operations just change the data that is equal to the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-off-preprocessor will see the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with every function, the text changes or hidden, you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer can process many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate and identify the simulated changes without it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you need to open a folder on the command line or dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are operated, then folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target folder was given, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically launch, do not start the merger, select the corresponding item menu or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you informs about the current progress. if you break scanning the folder, only the files will be listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan, click here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is represented normally. you can view a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all signatories insert and flaps up all the folders with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file extension is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such case the merge operation can not be selected automatically. if the interaction is started, you will be informed about problems of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is identical but even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as the same as their whole content is identical. then, the same folder will have the same color. in folders the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirts. the colours reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy from C (or if C does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if it does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e. g. a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects may exist, the merge may not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e. g. a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects may exist, the merge may not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no exponiter target folder, and if the option is synchronize directories. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action is identical to that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result into both folders (user watches only B; directly after merging copies & codiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and activate the new file instead of merge (uncertain), the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merge may not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, one file is based on the other. it's Status column shows Fertig when the merge has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected. if the merger is completed, you should make a final review and check if the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set the file dialog for Full Analysis, KDiff3 contains further columns. these contain the number of unforter, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or assembled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can choose either the straight selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the all-time promotions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in the three-file combination mode C as the target, B is chosen as a target and used for synchronizing A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, and there are some options to be skipped in folder. check these options for unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory assembly / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyword). in order to run only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">In case of conflicting file types still invalid merge actions appear, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then choose a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you compose all entries, a dialog box with the options result, simulations and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you would like to see what would really happen without the really changes. you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select directories reboot / continue, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue to work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; in a mistake, a message appears and detailed Status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages which can help you choose to solve the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were reported individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and executes these entries in later. even if here the merge operation has been taken or not saved, these entries will be regarded as being done. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merger with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree. there are multiple pattern to be entered. separate the pattern with a Semikolon;. valid placement holder: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default settings are not to conform to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placement holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placement holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatisch generated files will be ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignal file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignors.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems have a conversion attribute. in other file systems marked a leading point. a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In links to files: if the option is switched off, Symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to the links. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folder: if the option is switched off, the links are switched on. if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal folders and try recursively. (note that the links may lead to a final loop and & kdiff3; it turns off.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Runs a complete analysis of each file through and shows statistics-columns. (the number of dissolved, unforter, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and substantially slow when they are applied to files which does not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster, only the changeset and the file size. however, this speed gain cost you a certain degree of safety. please contact with caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidment date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical, if it is the same size. that can be useful if copying the change date lost. please use with caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was given. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are identical. even the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered insecure, because the other file doesn't have changed.) This option is switched off in any case.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed. if an old backup file exist with the .original file extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this option is enabled in default. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the file combination will appear in the interaction of individual files; you can change the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window files in the window menu and switch on the main window in the window menu and switch to switch between Directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double clicking. however, it is possible to execute a single file directly from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status is done and the file will not run once again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, when you read the directory again: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders based on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax of local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively. or.. .This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file is: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differentiated if a link is shown on a file or folder. then there is always a file defined as link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of the original. (note the option of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The primary application is currently used as a difference in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts to start the built-in differences. to initiate Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part I from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually needs & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, it takes as a part of the patch file. then, it decreases & chdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch is patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files has changed since the generation of patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or equal folders will not support in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compiling) there is already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can result in the range of diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time, and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or let him go there.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You can compile the program from sources compiled and the configure will not find the right prefix to KDE. in the default, KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are classified as identical; however, if only a non-white characters is different, the line is not identical. if you are not equal to Each other, the next to Each other, this one is encoded as this is the case of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply saved as text file and it's too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store these information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has to be too large. you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After the removal of text is suddenly washed; No src linqued; published and the text can't be extinguished, what does this and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to say goodbye. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install & cove 3; to compile and install, use the following command in basic folders of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-You gives the folder to your system, installed in the KDE. if you're unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automatic make use, you should not have any problems in compiling. if you have difficulties, please report on the & kde; mail list.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-removing) copied into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or repressing) add the text from the clipboard to the current curator position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not published in folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to read the folder with the function Update button.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown that identical files will not be copied into the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are likely to be changed after merging. (the behavior is likely to be displayed in a later program version.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on the selection of the source with the inscription A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines from the respective window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if it is not already available), if the lines are already present, they will be removed from clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">The default option is deactivated. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the work surfaces, to change their size, or postpone. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; may display all virtual desktops and the current applications. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; movement is possible both within a desktop and also on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; on the empty background of & kpager; on the empty background only the icon and the name of the application as well as the name of the application as well as the entries could minimize, maximize, on Desktop and ease. the following commands are:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of your desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows within the & kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on Desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager, the names of virtual workplace surfaces will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of the virtual working area indicate. it has been listed along with name, the names are provided with ordinates, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background in & kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs will be displayed as small window in & kpager; otherwise only the empty working areas are displayed in order to enable the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows the window with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; the main window can be determined: classic and kpager; in a 2xn grid appear, like from stock applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual desktops in a vertical row, which is very good for the view at the side of the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in size as symbols or with their content and move. in addition, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent to choose from switch switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment it is not possible to change the dialog for the dialog. however, you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must register as a user root or register to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowmode mode and assign it to a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is only available under & kde; this function is only available under & kde; please refer to the relevant documentation, to figure out how to automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values back to the dialog where you have set the button on the button. if you have already pressed the button button, settings are reset to the state after the last pressures of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first use the default settings. in particular, the intelligent slide should first be switched off. if you're using the automatic mouse, you can later push down the intelligent slide.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response pages of & kde; in sounds too.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on sites in the browser window, which does not represent a link. you can use the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. it's normally rather simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come with the mouse button in contact.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse balls. as it happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the sphere, you need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily be scratched with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system underbreaks the execution of & kmousetool; if you just use a shifting process. in this case the intelligent relocating means that & kmousetool means that the operation can't stop anymore due to the lot of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use one window manager in another window manager.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can execute a mouse click. this is due to the status of & kmousetool; you can go back as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run clicks and puts the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to make it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of Desktop, if you are looking for a mouse clicks. safe zones for mouse pop are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifting, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent push is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can cope with it. it is very likely to move in the clipboard or move into the clipboard. but it will probably cause them to prepare problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent slide, when you just start to use & kmousetool; select text instead: perform a mouse click here and hold the switch-down key while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and repressed the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button is pressed a sound like a mouse click. so you can use exactly when the intelligent push-shifting stops. later, you can use the intelligent slide without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest Extension for & X Window; that should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker and set it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse is harmed for short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, where the actuators are prepared pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that a certain period of time is waiting for a pulling-in process before the mouse button is omitted. in this way, the mouse button can also be carried out in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the work of filtering, it is important to know how the program "predispatcher" works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readers has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other executing and stops these contracts. if the output of the screen reader is read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normalized text. these orders will be resumed after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages are the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that messages are used. while you & eg; a long text is available on a web page, you can enter with & kmouth; someone is also welcome to enter the room. & kde; messages are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple texture orders. each order, which you need from the card card orders, is a text contract. KSayit is an example of a applications that are used textbooks. text entries are intended for issuing long texts which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four subtypes will be processed in queue, with the exception of the edition of Screen Readers. if an application will send the output of a Screen-reader, while & ktops; just such a readout, this output will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filter has never been applied to the output of Screen Readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text entries as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and continue on the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacing a text box replace parts of a text by other text. the replaceable parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions, which will be used by text or as regular expressions (as: -) by text or for formformation messages from & conversation; or e-mail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transducers use a XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from a format into another format. included in delivery of & ktops; are some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With microphone inputs, you can send orders according to the text content, or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktops; if you have set a female voice on the card card, you can read text from KDE news about it. read about it about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters are adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter ensures that its rules do not exist, the text remains unchanged for the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text contract, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification of & ktops; sent to them by all activated filters, which are set up on the page below. the processing through the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be shown below the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For installation of character-suspension filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison chart. these samples are exchanged in the text, then the text is replaced against the associated spare text. large and small written reference will not be considered as comparison.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "E-dispatcher" uses a customizable module architecture for synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktops; for using another synthesizers, you can contact the development team in connection with the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for XML; conversion filters, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or higher), including the packet boxes and the development files for the program "E-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source codes from & ktops; you have downloaded from the source code for kdeaccessibility or to download any night currently created tarball, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & ktops, please check first if your computer-dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; the program kttmsgr is to be developed so that the installation of the following dispatcher is not possible and the SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual propositions. the user can go through or drop-down, repeat the output or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application text goes to & ktops, you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have a speaker furnished, whose language English and its sex is female, this will be automatically the best matching speaker. if you want to learn more about it, just like & topts; a speaker is chosen, you can see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card spokesman to add or edit a speaker on the list or click Edit, the card spokesman speaker setup is displayed. as an example, in the following the device module for the Festival Interactive. details on the modules can be found under.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust loudness, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you are not able to select a knob and you can't choose this gray, the voice chosen by you can't choose this settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn votes will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices will already be loaded with the start of KTTSD, so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set becomes faster synthesized.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet created a speaker (or forgot to click on the user). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is indicated, the program window will be displayed next to the start of the programming window. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol can be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If Gstreamer or aKode can be used for the audio output, choose the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you need to install at least one module. if you have ALSA, choose the PCM device here. see also</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the subscriber speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200nbsp;% of the double normal speaking speed. thus these settings can be implemented, the program SOx must be installed.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you'll need to figure out what device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card card you can establish special promotions, which will always be executed if the text contract from a message is interrupted by a higher priority. & ktops; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen-Readers has the highest priority. it will be drawn up to all other applications and holds up these contracts. once the output of the screen reader has been read, orders received are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next key priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning holds the output of messages and normalized text. these orders will be resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that messages sent messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can feel it with & kmouth; nevertheless I welcome someone who entered the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text contract is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, insert & ktts; the audio output in the waiting line.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted. if both introductory sounds are active as well, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card map are only valid for normal text entries. for messages, warning and the issues of Screen-Readers, there are no special promotions, if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; take the Notify messages, start at tsmgr and click on alerts. the card notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to switch the read of & kde; -Notification. if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktops are no notifications before.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, alerts will be played, where a sound is played, from & ktops; not read.</seg>

<seg id="2715">All events, for which in the list is nothing else, are of & ktops are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this box in order to determine what & ktops are supposed to do if an event meets. you have the following selection options:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you select user defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placements:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can type the properties of the desired speaker. standard select the speaker that is displayed on the list of the card spokesman as top entry. see also here.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three planes for events. it is executed for a specific event of a particular application. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. the last possibility comes the action to carry out those under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All alerts for the application standard (all other events may not be deleted from the list. for this, you can define the following messages as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the button Save to store the settings for the alerts in a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Cancellent. all entries except All Notification will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice output. this standard contains brands for the control of voices, speaking speed, the volume, the gender voice and sound level. furthermore, trademarks for the control of identification of the sample is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently it supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound installation in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;% is usually adjusted very monoton.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked papa bear. who has slept in my bed? asked Mama bear. who has slept in my bed? asked the bear.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limits filters (SDB filters). this can be done & ktops; faster with the pre-read, since only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text contract. thus, you can also skip the whole text order, even if the synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-limits filter. during the first start of & ktops; it is set automatically set up as a preference for a set-limits filter. you can modify its settings or add additional set-limits filter, beginners, however, is discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest option allows you to try out the speaker selection and select text for presentations. check out the speaker selection again and check out some features and check out how the selection of the speaker has changed. in addition, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading the first set, because only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will be able to stop or cancel text entries on the card card, even if the synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limits filter is automatically set up when you start at tsmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything in this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabular sign (Decimal code 8) to the set limit (tabular code) will be removed automatically from the text (tabular code 8). note that the standard set limit filters are supplied from the string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter are never applied to & kde; -News (kage), warnings, messages or the output of Screen-Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have a look at the normal set-limits filter, you can merge this back by entering the standard _ sbdrc file; included file's standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card menu, you can write the subscriber settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words, no microphone properties are set.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all properties of a furnished speaker. if you don't delete the settings of the speaker. otherwise, chooses & ktops; otherwise choose & ktops; the actors from which most highlighted the originally introduced properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired office properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Please select the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this property does not play any role, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box when the property will have priority in front of other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in comparison of the issue, this feature is rarely used as a priority feature. you may use this feature rare in which you may want to specify the attribute speech, if you might know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all properties in the field of actors, just to delete the corresponding item, click on the selection button and then click on actors that complies with the Next to the Next.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the final text contract in the waiting line. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr falls off immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is crashed and & ktops. probably, you need to register Gstreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, possibly a not compatible version of gamer is installed. you may try to upgrade or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output by ALSA does not work when I play music playing at the same time with another application. if I stop a text contract, freezes & ktops; a message appears on the & console; there is a message that says: "to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem that conflicts has been appearing with ALSA, which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-projection ect.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have an extra voice for Festival from the internet. I installed it and can use them in Festival, but the tsmgr shows this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktarint / vocals / vocabulary / vocals. as a guide, please send us a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card audio there is a setting speed. that's how the program SOx is installed and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizeros such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on selected voice is this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the subscriber speed are ignored, if & ktops; & HTML; read either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very courageous, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -to-SSML-sensor, and set up the subscriber speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that web pages will be read with a female voice. I have set up a female Festival speaker, but & ktops. read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta appears that the day Sable GENDER does not work. so the festival does not produce errors, throws the XSL file to converting SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a private drawing filter filter and now I can proceed in & ktops; not more satin or go back. on the box, orders will appear only from one movement. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Interscores (point, question mark, exclamation mark, Komma and Semikolon) may not filter out. use a filter for the set-limits for these signs instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed (www.alsa-projection ect.org)</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time, and then start a text when you start a text contract and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The choice of Automatically the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information is required for each system start, therefore no further adjustments are required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The selection manual can be performed without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must specify the desired TCP / IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initiates the network interface of booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The website of & knetworkconf is http: / / knetworkad.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of the binary distribution options (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console with rpm like this:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphic interface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but also the development package with libraries and others are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & chnetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf file will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information about IP networks. in this Annex, only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks can be operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never seen great dissemination. IPv6 is expected that it is expected in the near future. this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the main information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, the & eg; workplace is the network administrators, which can be used by a valid IP address, or, if available, the IP address cannot be selected as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a custom small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular network for this purpose to avoid IP address transfer with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by adjusting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is needed for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section there are configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so it is not surprised when in case of active DSL connections and other content is specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, is known that this file is disconnected by the scripts in search config. another stand can be found as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat, is a program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a surface for tar for fast, selective spin. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife said: how much longer it takes you to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trained the band back and reads the prestressing of the band. know & kdat, the band on the band will not be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the spell, search for the matching index on your record. can't be found, you will be asked if the band index is re-created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has been smooth, changing the symbol for the tape drive to display that the band was inbound. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before discard the tape, first the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat, there is a change in the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat, it is necessary to formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you need to store data. this process does not comply with the formatting at & kdat; it does not need to formatted the tape before using the tape. floppy tape drives usually do not require formatting the tape drive, DAT drives cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat, with the formatting of the tape. all data on the band is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to choose the backup files. this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file-tree. it will only be secured or protected from the file.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file-tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file-tree and select in the menu of Sichuan...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is initiated, the dialog box settings for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archive file for the drive. it will only be selected to select the selected file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives for the band with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears overlooked. this dialog shows the progress of test access as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can select the rebuilding, the files that are to be restored will be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog for restoring. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for restoring.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialog appears restore. this dialog shows progress in progress, as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the band indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the straight marked files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a viewing profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup is scheduled to take place. the list of files to be secured automatically according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under the backup file are that only those files are secured on the same file system, as the folder. folders based on other file systems, you can register separately under backup files. each entry will be viewed from tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last inincremental backup, a snapshot file will be secured, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The file's name, which is used to specify the changes since the last inincremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files at the time of creating this documentation is not completely implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can make the settings about the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-regenerative model of the strap.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, send & kdat; before the band is inbound, the command is leftly to drive the drive. in some running plants this is necessary, before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tried & kdat to lock out the throw at tape drive. this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the soldering integration of & kdat will automatically apply the tape automatically. use this option to float Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, tried & kdat; the hardware prescription block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to use & kdat; in any case the block size is possible for your band's work.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If the dat file format is formatted, it writes a file to the start of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(s Byte) The format ID. the format of this string is host: seconds, whereby the name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds to formatted in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named $HOME / .kdat file in the same name.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that directly manage with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as they are not involved in incremental safety.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Test the contents of a backup unit. this symbol is only active when a band is inbound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystem log; is a & kde; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksslog; experienced users the quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kscutter blog; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is appropriate for inexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is deposited with different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log; experienced users have quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server. & ksSystems log; therefore attempts to provide some extended functions, using the protocol files to be filtered and analysed.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksslog; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and are explained in other chapters of this book.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & kscutter log; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol file easily filter and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching & ksslog; first attempts to open the system protocol - the system protocol will start to open. the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filtering a list box in the filter bar. the list of the protocol will automatically display the list box next to the filters all. then a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search terms.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term will then apply only with entries in the corresponding column. select a column process, and then carry out & ksslog; all the minutes lines, which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default settings and helps you detect the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of level errors will be displayed with a conspicuous color or protocol-lines of level note. colour display of minutes lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process. so, for example, if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new coming minutes lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksysteme log; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksysteme log; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksSystems log.forum-software.or.or.or.or.dort you will find further information about reference sources of & ksystem log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksSystems log; also in the following folders of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystem log; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the system in the & Linux; world. this is why it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue in historical aspects here (and because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why someone could try to install a machine on system V init without creating a new installation and reformat. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD inspite that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder means rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to run when moving to the system or when changing to another lap level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services does not include such stuff like setserial, which is only once launched. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie in its part under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not much used for this. you can also use a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to run something on high, what has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / incompatible. in the initial area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-pre-produced Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can repair / etc / insoles from hand, then you can repair it by restart the system by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it then start all the right scripts? if you have to enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this file are no right files. instead, every entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? easy: any of the scripts are written thus that it accepts a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script will be accessed using the argument. if it contains an S, the script will start with the argument boot.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could play & eg; a server lap record that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. Moreover, I also could have a user-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand unit is simple to say to say: go simply an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six Runtime levels to start on this level (or stop stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between lap times, or change the position within a level by changing it differently. this happens only if they move an entry in the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are delayed if you want to copy them into a new zone. in order to copy them only to a new track, you need to select copy from the menu edit or from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated additionally. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries in the paper basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another track, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired lap level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the tab button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file, before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are produced in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if they are available. otherwise, they are saved by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts again. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single mode mode. then edit the file / etc / inittdown and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not run.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & Suix, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type of how system services can be started in these distributions, the configuration for proprietary programming languages of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please verify that all configuration files are needed (and also if they are in the right folder). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) is just without a message when their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be anywhere from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send us more information about Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you'll need to save them. either use the relevant icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears in the dialog User - or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you can upgrade your settings (Quota) for users, a card card will appear, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map map password management appears if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card appears only if it is enabled and initialized for at least one integrated filesystem (Quota) file (detectable at the quoted file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, the space restrictions on each user can be changed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the field system file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the group of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the primary group. furthermore, the user can mark users in other groups by clicking it in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the menu user or group or click on the matching button button of the toolbar. the edit or delete of the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
