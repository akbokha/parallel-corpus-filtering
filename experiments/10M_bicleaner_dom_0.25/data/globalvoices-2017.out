although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinary .
how many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors , and run his sports .
in fact , this country had a poor pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ter who had taken place with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student , the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to continue his interest .
I was caught .
free according to Method Man , &quot; I was it , &quot; it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA only strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , its diversity is so inv@@ iting , that you can always be the one who you are and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of equally healthy people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had written a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with its narrow face .
he never stops his mind behind the mountain , as you say so nice .
he says exactly what he th@@ inks like a former colleague , and explains publicly its cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , people have voted for his statements and tuned to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes he won by the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever recorded by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ma person , I asked me ?
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with people who met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , tr@@ um@@ ps world@@ view did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced for the environment for her life long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who actually treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues , to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er was helped me much with my career .
these people and those through them em@@ bo@@ red my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump transferred his way to the nominated republi@@ can Presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the equivalent of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the meditation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either giving his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tors as a p@@ assi@@ sts .
the people , said one of my friends , is that which led us to this situation .
this is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates a ability to understand those who deal with a different way and thinking .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account .
could it be that this elec@@ torate , of whom most of the white have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re @-@ win control of a country that has disappointed ?
in other words , they may say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe maybe .
but one can &apos;t forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with respect to those who look like it differently .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other Eth@@ ics ; &quot; voc@@ abulary from white in recognition to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is so much like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as did the big Van Jones , exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always have always like America is always welcome .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history is as he himself says , nowhere else in the world were possible .
but with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise to and say : to hell with mani@@ fold , religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , say .
in all these things I have to think to K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a voc@@ abulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ph@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ar the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices were loud .
&quot; if any man , who is not like you , has a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ked , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your American . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
now this is Tr@@ um@@ ps country , the message said .
and all the people , like Mr. Khan , could not find no more space in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that music that is played at both sites , not only the life of the children , but also has a close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large land@@ fill , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colom@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments , has an opportunity to overcome them in the surrounding of poverty .
a music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the commune of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and bonds .
but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn the day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically above the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are produced from recovered waste material :
music with repeated instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycled card started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez in order to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were produced from waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is rec@@ alled by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local bi@@ ologist and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura at the start time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same spot the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as a F@@ avi@@ sta something which he had never seen before : a violin had produced violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of re@@ prepared material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ical refuse gar@@ bage ) records the musical performance on :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something nice .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played even before Pope Francis in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work will succeed Il@@ legal F@@ isheries
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focused on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship was already held in Liberia waters of illegal fishing , before it sought to wait for other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were disp@@ ers@@ ed behind this and slightly slo@@ ped , a decree of those kind to be welcomed to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles will quickly move against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a f@@ isheries permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries which you simply refused to re@@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authorities . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t successful to catch the fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , for pill@@ aging the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and conservation , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries next to Somalia and Madagascar , which then had driven out the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed and working together . they share information and stand against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding . this project gives F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , so because it is extremely difficult to make it extremely difficult . therefore illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , which are to be protected by means of certain habit@@ ats and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate balance .
however , during the actions of illegal fishing , the actions were replaced by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dle , and through the sn@@ ail @-@ cont@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions nowadays occur in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there can be exchanged to the individual countries , such as lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ icious activities or details that could be noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tion .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very att@@ entive to move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas . also , so susp@@ icious drivers will discover - such that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved in a f@@ isheries , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have been a criminal off@@ ender .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information that the ships can not sell its cargo . and that they could even be forced to be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that deals with the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $ 20 million in lost sales , representing eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year , because of the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish species , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial catch from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among other practices include actions , like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license documents , speci@@ fying fantasy species , the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation , and make the weak@@ nesses of a failed @-@ organized control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not pass a ship illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You are not able to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has revealed criminal networks , distributed to the f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and has found dead ships and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to make susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed continuously , helps to send the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fisher@@ man use very sophisticated techniques to conce@@ al their activities and to hide their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Music analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO who also offers fishing information and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch to an example of their automated identification systems , where they can &apos;t be hired by satellites .
so Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find a criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually take effect on the undou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of it , who does what is doing - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and collect their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at the global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to meet the global system tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ective crime , but also ref@@ resh them .
ships that previously explo@@ ited without any license and had hardly to have consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i include a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries sales , since then fishing boats are selling more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 led the inspec@@ tors , found the inspec@@ tors there on board gri@@ ds , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have been subject to study project several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
there will be six countries joined in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to leave even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member of Somalia could report his first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not prohibited .
the ship was still in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the take of action against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collab@@ orative work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
her article appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is continuing to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conquer the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela will seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had rejected the request of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians acted in its eyes on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rep@@ ay@@ ment of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuous , which makes the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians to be in@@ adequate due to an acute lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of fundamental change ; but ultimately resulted in a re @-@ election of the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at the Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the context of the inter@@ governmental report as follows :
within the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate in the world are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient deficiency , the referendum for many as the only way to withdraw their institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly Mu@@ d ( about : round Table of the Democratic Unity ) , which led to the opposition to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , the trial against the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro took place in the way . in addition , the trial against the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was planned to continue with the Venezuel@@ an government , the Venezuel@@ an government residence , on November 3rd , should continue to continue until the completion of the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter amongst others as follows :

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time are witnesses to include an overwhelming participation of people in numerous regions of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ate of the government .
one of the most frequently divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the prot@@ ector : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vene@@ tians cried . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures collected from disp@@ utes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
in particular , great waves beat the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement , before the police and armed insur@@ rection of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state @-@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no tubes , because otherwise it could not see what many national gar@@ bage workers did not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic on the round forms the magn@@ itude of suppression each day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had taken the validity of the demand for a de@@ bur@@ ial procedure - this was now shown in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are f@@ ake .
here is your counter@@ part !
on the street !
other values like further step in the fight against a government made out of their point of view little against the devastating economic crisis and rather than expected to be able to hide critical voices :
they have taken so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are continually increasing by frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported to the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was comp@@ elled by his father , the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has now said within the context of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were committed as crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the guarant@@ or to carry the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he retained the family secrets for 34 years .
in the situation then I thought that it was ok .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years you do not notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not know that my father was a thief , Fol@@ der and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of State terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 became Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who is charged with compensation in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities , who had experienced as a boy in the course of years , and who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parents about his child , and like this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you pre s@@ cour@@ ged you with one of the ERP .
pass only that they lead you not one day , and I must save you .
the short@@ cut ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ck@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university graduates , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ Where do the prisoners become tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he waited me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the car , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket par@@ ked par@@ cel and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ um@@ ps of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a post .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
there , the prisoners become tor@@ tured .
I go in and saw a Lie@@ ge to be tor@@ tured on the people .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was fixed to the body of the person who lay it up there .
they f@@ ess@@ ed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw it with water and pursued a charge of 220 Volt in the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the stri@@ fe there was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible , that a man can harm a man so much ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed .
when my father took me for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the cap@@ tives were em@@ itted with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound up .
he talked with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was accused in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were sitting down with the face - all were at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people still remain silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you think so , ass ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told you at home .
apart from La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck there a man there and killed him .
( according to the survivors from the survivors of the civilian population Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina was accused of death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path where you came in , is also the way where they come here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and tor@@ tured for the first time .
here were changed their names and were assigned to them as part of the process of de@@ formation .
when they had survived the torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be transferred .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ phr@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my father brought all sorts of stolen things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war tro@@ se was a bay@@ on@@ ett or maybe military commis@@ sions that you combat an enemy who fights against the enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I do not understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you that you walk on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded rage , and struck me , and cried , saying ,
when you go so far , then I will find you and re@@ inv@@ ent you .
we need no one another !
that &apos;s my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph from that time on which I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater of wool . both my dad had taken from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a fellow in this crime . I said , no problem , they can put my burden to me what they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or &apos;
now , where I am older , I do re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and know that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you do so during the dictatorship of human beings . but why are the dead to disappear ?
why do children escape ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it was just how easy to put into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why to kill their bodies ?
did these people not have families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act , which you can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoner .
they were torn down and somewhere . no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; my father said .
but anything remains always there .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the idea to show my father arose during a talk when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the abomin@@ ations which I had to do for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt mad and asked me to what the whole Patri@@ otic Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually well .
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you comp@@ elled me as a kid in doing so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just that did I do .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad@@ vert .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal crimin@@ als .
no one can submit to me that I &apos;m going to pre @-@ use . I have told my own Father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto , where you can leng@@ then his driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license , last month of a very special translation .
the Japanese word ( co@@ ag@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means that &quot; older drivers &quot; means worse - maybe even with mal@@ icious back@@ ground@@ breaking &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; translated .
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads at the entrance and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided in the social media .
the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also aware of the local time for the local time .
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to that an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is a ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes &apos; said .
the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . ( German : &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although the gramm@@ atical does not have the correct name &quot; El@@ der &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture debt rep@@ lic@@ ated for the translation errors . furthermore , she stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had not been reviewed by translator and that the translation was not tested on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told us about the exc@@ use :
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that older people felt through in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News continued in detail with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was ref@@ using as an appropriate description of elderly drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents in the country .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by the elderly in 2005 , representing a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens stood 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this makes her share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of deaths caused by seniors has risen in the same period .
the name @-@ mentioned rep@@ ortage in the published version of article Comments on the Light which show that preliminary parts are some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) isn &apos;t the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it wrong , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that it is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is to be used throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a real mine of this bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language , something that is in the case of native speakers . generally , the convic@@ tion that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language .
such a French native language should be translated from English to French in English - not from the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language that could justi@@ fy translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the transfer , reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers that could learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have any foreign employees , have translations made company internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad their language skills .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with fun results .
the promised and tra@@ verse propositions which can arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique is not yet able to replace any human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English for@@ mu@@ gs in Japan , including those who decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or not understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by great companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , the Venezuel@@ an Internet users reported that they have no access to online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV can not be easily accessible .
other online transmitters also contributed to the recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ positi@@ vely groups who contra@@ dict the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tractor . he pointed out that the connection is coupled , and receive the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers can be locked once again .
that is from the side of @ vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ tians with Internet access , especially in times of rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been concerned with the coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission threatened with fin@@ es and closure , if the Commission could continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission looked on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative National TV channels I registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that the cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade can be purchased .
the local NGO association association association later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was un@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
earlier replica of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers can use DNA . it is a technique that answer the DNS server questions of certain domains .
if a website is blocking through the DNS server , the server answers faulty or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm having a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ it@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday , April 6 , when V@@ PI@@ TV Camera was El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who captured the protests in Caracas live in detention .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was a police custody .
eight hours later , he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this means that the Vene@@ tians are always worth access to multi@@ media coverage about current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls to be s@@ cler@@ ics in order to obtain training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where they worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ tz , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the home again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who have become something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money over its under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned above , that the children must pay for countless days of house work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not raise up in the context of a contract .
this was called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected a witness , resear@@ ched and refused .
they attempted to name the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees a stand@@ still in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illu@@ sion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one part of the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their training , improve their position in society and can make something out of itself . &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who particip@@ ates the girl with faith and justi@@ fy their exploitation by faith , that someone would give someone a chance that would not be an apprenticeship , otherwise it might even be hungry .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never learn it .
so far , in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ ak@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of fierce battles . shortly afterwards , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former army of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer during the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they felt that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply involved in the par@@ ak@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay are Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , amongst which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want the Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to trial , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as labour force , they are also ins@@ ulated by other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ah lived in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work and began to work on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time so that you still remained for learning too .
it stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , puri@@ fied the refrigerator , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground down the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more it was finished with learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hunger , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the househ@@ older than food from the fridge , &quot; reminis@@ cent of it . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party responsible during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings the bud@@ get@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and find out leader of opposition time such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give evidence of the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retained them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house had found someone who heard it while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would say there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; that they mean that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak at home again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had allowed to lose , declares them .
it was however completely clear that she had paid for everything that she had paid for them with her hard work .
also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was dis@@ crimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken , are mob@@ bing and the har@@ nesses of which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children of parents have , they immediately recogn@@ ise that someone who has no parents , is cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not load home after my home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends originate , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

draft bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary committee recently approved a draft bill to &quot; the regul@@ ators of usage and use of social networks . &quot;
when he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt in a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up for use in order to use citizens , citizens and citizens .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users need to register within the site of the site with their proper name and number of personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; any application that will run on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is being en@@ forced , since the draft cannot be imposed on how the Egyptian authorities are able to impos@@ e users who do not register with regard to the fact that the Egyptian government currently is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament and member of the Legislative Decree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a user name and a password to come through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook .
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the incident .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Department &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly advise the technical capacities and the understanding of any neither agency in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion it is possible to imagine that as they are violent in physical and private spaces that could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a powerful monitoring system to apply citizens to monitor a permit or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to take it a court process .
this is technically no way realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the Legislative Assembly and the constitutional committees before being deb@@ ated in the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military reas@@ oning in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ rative is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , the Council of Parliament , T@@ amer El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill of law against Cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was found guilty of thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten the public order and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protection H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq began to protect the spiritual op@@ ard Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which mat@@ ures through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) , as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they always find fewer prey , at risk .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining prey in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to watch a Persian Leop@@ ards in the open space is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is that they have a recording of a great cat in the camera that leaves R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately shows a different side of its country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in wild animals for six years and involved wild animals and educational programmes of nature .
she has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is preparing to ensure that protective zones can be set up in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the North @-@ East Japan have been affected by the life of those who were affected by the &quot; Tri@@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a certain pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ns were forced evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had experienced a nuclear accident , but already about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shown at the local point of view which adv@@ ances in progress for six years in order to re @-@ build the life of local @-@ resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building process and pol@@ l results of the affected themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes ( pool , child , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . 80 percent of the planned spare homes were finished here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened 70 percent of its final light .
while still , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by the command , evacu@@ ated by the command of residence ( which was evacu@@ ated by us ) in final replacement houses .
according to the three @-@ way disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been more successful in emer@@ gen@@ cies . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated sub@@ mer@@ cies were moved into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stand of works and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung could find out , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by evil , will open its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now come into operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 per cent of fishing ports have recovered their operations .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , bred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land large @-@ area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destro@@ ys farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear fire zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has continuously recovered again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains unbe@@ aten yet .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , there can be only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their lives .
is the indigenous population prepared on the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated population . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , as their emp@@ ath@@ ering has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction by the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung declares :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey resulted in 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of those surveyed expect that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es have been done .
as it stands for those who need to evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima was a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phy , atomic accident , who had to experience Japan in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside of the pre@@ fecture .
in early 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 state , more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas are more than 50 years old . they must be rec@@ alled in proper destination , because the efforts made for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one met people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences were initially larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while you often know that one more connects more than it at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our processes , and recall our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal topics that often get less attention when you earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country bound@@ aries .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world . Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . in nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against au@@ sterity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions .
doctors operated this Saturday in this Saturday and have translated him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers is also recogni@@ zable with a head@@ stock attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident recorded by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , such as Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators and landing at the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , is distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , which is attacked as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several San@@ itary shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , have donated $ 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while staying in the hospital .

this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media prot@@ ector missed the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window of windows .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a crushed glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo of their titles .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ driven bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window , than the protests of thousands , who serve the defense of a special thing to report .
this is necessary to recogn@@ ise if one is stri@@ cken against any form of damage .

the For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages to Cuba from Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ ates in Cuba
the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Municip@@ ality Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - Spanish Zu@@ ck@@ erm@@ ühle - well , regardless of that there are no significant sugar harv@@ ested on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were driven into the sugar cane mills .
after the nar@@ ration , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute every day to the factories , which still should be grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo flower , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the su@@ gar@@ cane industry can not sleep his sleep .
he heard that it is in the eastern region of the sugar cane mill , which are back into operation after a long time , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the su@@ gar@@ cane industry resistance already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for some decades ago , but the poor harvest is no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar tube industry switched off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff from the congregation saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the train crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price went back around a decade ago .
between 2017 and 2025 , the prize has to remain un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Land@@ scapes &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar @-@ export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; today &apos;s day the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro became the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same thing happened in the su@@ gar@@ cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word which he is repeated most repeatedly , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respondents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to preserve the place , it formed a full time working group .
before the first quarter of the year , the first letters began to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially stated that documents only concerning the parts that would be removed , addressing the address and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all were signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could sing every withdrawal .
from there passed the responsibility and the letters were increasingly more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the l@@ apping factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation for the production of sugar cane factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , where construction it helped , involved .
each part , which he removed , dismant@@ led him one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important bur@@ ners were wi@@ ped out .
in many cases no alternatives were found for employment and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw that it was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mill
sugar cane has been extracted only high by M@@ ed since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the parish of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory ended , or better , when they began to listen to them , they also heard on paved road , this dis@@ advant@@ ageous way for other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search out other factories .
they were too spare parts .
without any future prospects , many young people left the region once again .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring to the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ cked person , nevertheless he rep@@ ented of lies that they told him not .
they serve him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is missing in force , but because he is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

first Nations yo@@ ungst@@ ers use hip @-@ hop to express itself and maintain their own culture

young people from the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 , workshop mobile sound studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were directed by ped@@ agogue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop - group The North@@ stars .
the workshop reveals that the young participants in discussions topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they are in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells example the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway from tears , &quot; on the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t have to worry about the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation are recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a St@@ anza in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ anza is available in the tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me
but I try to walk back my days on earth
this is the day that you will get to our cry
because we lost our way in life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that we will rise for a day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and advance to our youth
thus they can do so what they are the Creator
in the commentary part , the reader and supp@@ orter of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the St@@ anza in Sil@@ van@@ os ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see sculp@@ tural dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance of the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin of san@@ pur@@ u ( one @-@ end , &quot; Plast@@ ische Models of the courts &quot; ) served by any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers can see this plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a multitude of these small companies that produce plastic dishes which was documented in the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes usually so that they do not find them any more . however , a new trend is transformed into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ it@@ u .
now on sale : new with plastic @-@ filled mobile phone tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food products have been changed to kit@@ es items such as in this case , cooling cabinet mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ck refriger@@ ator@@ - mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of Ess@@ ay@@ ments will increasingly be more complex .
in this case a Imperial @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
also this part we have been produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keep@@ eth your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the company .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to restore your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon che@@ ers are used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can cause my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less app@@ et@@ ite form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the not@@ ori@@ ous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico , the losses and those killed regularly are in statistics . however , these are not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the submission on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of Sin@@ al@@ oa @-@ Kart@@ ells , compl@@ ained the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident is hardly someone looking for the sad@@ ness or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each cor@@ ks , behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never cure cancer .
that is why the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) and stories of people are telling the victims of human persecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project this way :
organized crime doesn &apos;t only allow us to fear our lives .
the impact is a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug hands and all congregations therefore need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear of Life &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who sear@@ ches for every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father and two brothers and two of their n@@ eph@@ ew on one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have made to go and go to the graves after the people who we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she will not pay them out because that a death certificate ask .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state of state .
the project is based on stories from les@@ bians and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero , in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , in which form it occurs :
I have been acquain@@ ted with illness and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for some years .
I get over every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the tit@@ els@@ sides with pictures , which can actually come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who was wi@@ de@@ pri@@ ved or sad . it works , like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal or considered normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old C@@ ousin think that he is great . and it is also not normal that people songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders when going through the streets .
for me this is , as they would have lost to those who lost someone and those who have fear them something happened .
I see our weakness , if stories are to blo@@ om numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village might be justified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to talk to the fact that they spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they don &apos;t touch themselves and still are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of pressing in the city district . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminal month was pl@@ under@@ ed for month money from their business until they had destroyed only the business , but also her family had torn apart .
you think all that you lost , and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never going away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they lead you or kill .
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days , if there would be my deepest feelings feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the designated Generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he th@@ rows questions on how : who cares for the child of a mixed wife and man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other young boys of his old age , whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he himself had to bite itself how to make an egg cooking , potatoes , tortillas warm , and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for one boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he had only a few blocks from his home , the bloody surro@@ unds of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a so@@ jour@@ ne@@ ying car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a violence through the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder by public security and government of government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor numbered 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 murder per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; in 2015 , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico established the data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages which he links to which he is represented , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in one moment , in which it comes to withdraw a rum@@ or or f@@ ake a f@@ ake .
but how is the years since something is di@@ pped in the first time ? content in social media , whether it or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to stand further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to illustr@@ ate , trage@@ dies , which was actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about our desire to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ led and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa was neg@@ l@@ ected in the second largest country for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path with impact holes which were difficult to drive .
carrying out the tank car to the victim .
by government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozen houses , including a cinemas near , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championship .
fold the houses dist@@ ressed and stolen tents in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ compreh@@ ension .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the occurr@@ ences form the gray scenes of that day .
above is an example of it .
it displays rows of stolen body which rolls on the ground while they are looking forward to seeing it .
but here the story does not find their end .
over the years , the same photo was removed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but probably not related to the related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 milit@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the indigenous towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of hor@@ rors before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and served in roads and bus@@ hes .
there were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one resident to Human Rights Watch .
many were dismant@@ led , shot or burned .
only from satellite imag@@ ery , the follow @-@ up time could be presented .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the image of the DR Congo appeared again , as it appears as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ erable use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mal@@ icious descriptions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was brought to mass kill@@ ings .
another step further bring personal comments like this example will fold the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the p@@ liers came also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who flee hits , rape and some deaths , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posters like the following on which these descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news , which said in 2012 , the president of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said that mon@@ k and polit@@ ician participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other News organizations that referred to AF@@ P as their source , had also believed Th@@ ein his testimony , but did not have the image taken from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false declar@@ ations
traces of these false declar@@ ations date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; re@@ trac@@ ed picture search &quot; you can see how far beyond borders cannot exceed limits .
an over@@ turned image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has shown 344 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and Community publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ ayed out false reports to un@@ mask the counter@@ feit .
we have used examples of the dis@@ mis@@ erable use and associated with the respective countries in connection , based on which site they had been published . by this we want more clearly more clearly than through the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ used chemicals can also be linked from the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other in some cases ) .
here some cases , which can now be felt completely split ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
country @-@ examples of false cop@@ es of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the limited countries , on pages or server , are still available via the examples of counter@@ feit banknotes or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in Grau are examples that are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DRC was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

in this post a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not only the wrong message , but also inv@@ aded the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions according to the int@@ enti@@ ons of persons and the re@@ trac@@ ting ar@@ ships ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria they burned the Christians ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica is quoted as its source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( which is not known if the original report contains the image ) .
France , 2015 .
at the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this , which used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who contra@@ dict these things .

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of the students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in islam@@ ic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency Nas@@ im and illustr@@ ative the image of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria this photograph taken from the DR Congo as a proof for the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o , in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for an evil use of the image of the DR Congo , with one part of a twe@@ eter against the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos of these were ab@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Government of Myanmar published a correc@@ ting position as &quot; deliber@@ ately fing@@ ered news and photographs that came to international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this composition , which appeared exclusively in English , includes references to f@@ ake images of rum@@ or that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech can operate and carried out by extrem@@ ist groups to destroy that Muslims kill Budd@@ hist@@ s and elsewhere ( which is often widespread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly demonstrates that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslim to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wr@@ ong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein in 2012 proved that mon@@ k and polit@@ ician were involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the p@@ liers .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 over students who have been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture was not written by the killing , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ wind@@ ling attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ dict it would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertil@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and carried out a discussion under Muslims after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the Tu@@ esdays at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of Islam , a bigger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture has been edited as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were linked to them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; male singer Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre was put into circulation , it put discussion like this here in Vietnamese and declared it for the wrong message .
from the embassy where the image from the DRC was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of in@@ correct use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , The Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp will exist on the web@@ cra@@ wler and have to be united in relation to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately could possibly have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( turbul@@ ence ) that crosses this post . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to bigger discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - for defence of Muslims - murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second ro@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important and therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers will not give this pictures no longer faith .
with social media , there are 40 people who un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal the proportion to tr@@ ash water around one tragedy .
sug@@ ary these mood of mal@@ ice and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and do it seem to th@@ aw the real grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images was already deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures reader and spect@@ ator will take the ability to emp@@ t emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who should teach , as violent media have to help others ) .
while there is a lot concerning violent represent@@ ations in the media media , fact that they are indispens@@ able for the present news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms , in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thoroughly re@@ thinking about the situation in which a picture actually sug@@ ged , which can actually be used from the context or entirely ab@@ used type .
each inquiry has to be taken into account , however , should be considered internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ oured to offer voice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these in@@ disp@@ utable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi Saudi ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ vi@@ esa ) .
but all resist hard @-@ nec@@ cess@@ es every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , so a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words were already gathered for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u sales book , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - for your parents in recognition of how to make you stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ el language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun .
in his own words in his blog about :
they de@@ cent other cultures , un@@ veil other thoughts and wake up our curios@@ ity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the gu@@ ill@@ ists on this site or show more of this &quot; ir@@ re@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka has seen the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ sun , who usually puts in end of May , by heavy rainfall , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement by the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are injured because of the floods and s@@ lu@@ dge .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26th May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence .
the rainfall followed on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water flows in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions in the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood cat@@ astrophe :
high tide at Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water walls up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates for flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kan &apos;s fatal accidents caused the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , save the Children , after other rainfall are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stand in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ yl@@ ates of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made for transportation of emergency supplies for those in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages , such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ IMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .

Women &apos;s March 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .

using approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust in her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , they trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we will call the rights of women for women &apos;s rights .
in the next step we use rights for transactions .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other Scandinavi@@ an par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend watches me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things concern you not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their performance .
they de@@ comp@@ ose me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see any of them .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify to be a Muslim , on different types but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective presentation , that as soon as Muslims , as I do not adjust there , is to be rep@@ lic@@ ated .
to be era@@ dic@@ ated
I won &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures arrive in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ xer pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Quran , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western introduction , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the induc@@ tive pictures of Muslims , the Western books as early as centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that should fear , and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ band@@ ed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise up today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to continue .
I &apos;ve been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , in@@ correct nar@@ rative domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this scar sur@@ passes the reality that in the last three decades of nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are in@@ hib@@ ited , their head@@ scarf in public buildings to wear and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same coin .
a mighty group exercises its &quot; control &quot; of the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong scar weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements to change .
it sees the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been killed with slave ais@@ les .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has seized our collective power force deep and un@@ broken , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are often used to treat an@@ tim@@ acy attacks and clo@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell us and due to the species where we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia are not only fear of Islam , religion but it &apos;s fear of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry is failed to prevent the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are failed to make up seven million Muslims who make the highest degree of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim populations are African @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that originate from 77 countries .
parents of the author was in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewell@@ ery design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ables from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan announced the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ sufficient Muslims and Americans .
but now I &apos;m und@@ um@@ ated Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes and take out my hand@@ bag , which all Muslims take with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we don &apos;t carry all the peb@@ bles with us .
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight widespread lies far beyond Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ produced Islam@@ op@@ t@@ ness of money , th@@ ink tanks and experts for fal@@ tering information which is our already def@@ ective picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and due to the species where we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in more than just a fore@@ igner who breaks the head@@ scarf with a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on Mos@@ ques in the USA , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms att@@ acking our affili@@ ation .
it takes up our identity , which is much more widespread , so versatile and versatile that it can fit into a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a photo of their kinder@@ garten .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would like to see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that can separate our houses .
she would see the om@@ ab@@ end@@ ary rit@@ ual with my daughter if I was silent in my arms , and ye gave the Arabic sentences to protect the cor@@ an and the Q@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I pray therefore , that it is protected from evil , the evil which you can see and evil that can not see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim status is always a part of my att@@ acking .

use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother , with her sisters , as she gained a competition from the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it is the picture of you that I close in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and incomplete paintings with a lot of bookmark , a book with an hundred and fourteen chapters that it can be almost man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ra@@ ble .
Muslim to be Muslim means to speak the prayers which she had said to me , when I have a bad day .
for the Muslim to be Muslim , how they brought me to refer to God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation whose name was colon@@ ised by a &quot; Empire &quot; through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name hon@@ our@@ able British East ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to God to name my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men should not weep , but at the same time to see that my suffering father wept .
Inter@@ im rin , while he writes books on the modern Islam and of the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in the Indian killing family , which he was not close to his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , from col@@ oni@@ alists , which have dealt the Muslim world as at the game risk .
for the Muslim Brotherhood , Muslim claims that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was cast by a Muslim land in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ Swedish , fas@@ cist sub@@ jection of British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before it had air@@ planes , he travelled into more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , deep in our unforgettable family trees go back ; our un@@ connected history .
it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , had gone over every continent to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
an American Muslim means to be knowing that the suicide rate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy bears the United States and bears a Muslim name , which accounts for four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that over ten hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ av@@ eng@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Brotherhood .
it is hope that I feel when we rise for our dreams , and if we say black life .
an American woman , a p@@ ah@@ an , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our ident@@ ities of multiple bin@@ ders , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing bi@@ dity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
a mother to be a mother means to care of my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged individuals to establish on this bic@@ ar@@ iness of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists of the Muslim regi@@ sters which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officers who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that extends its borders across people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a wrong and neb@@ ul@@ sive &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes up largely Arabs and Muslims .
they are the wars which we lead and the bombs that we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , the North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ parall@@ eled image and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 of the evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to dev@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the def@@ ective and dangerous image prints which we commit to our news actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , which attempts to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ al ; Sh@@ ust@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , pro@@ lifer@@ ative Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ anian , Muslim , American super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global time , where we are located .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ists have existed in the dark corners of the internet , now running the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because Muslims have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by providing the &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they have large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of what I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me to have been a Muslim Muslim .
things I have left here like a baking stone track in my speech .
things , who may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ tions that makes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley find conversation within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms , with which we usually cast us in our schools or read it in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I count this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where is Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the pro@@ cure of &quot; others &quot; in public vision , four decades even science of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable issues after the role of being aware and un@@ conscious of &quot; other &quot; to fix it , as it is my gir@@ l@@ friend and I have not bom@@ bed a new future , while it is already broken up to us , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
history of history , of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be an option to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices told a short story of Steven Bird , the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able blog .
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and ob@@ sol@@ ete the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS had already been held since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world may be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure rooms where residents do not forget to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Listen to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to these events instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , hist@@ ories form their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ counter , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the audi@@ ences can be attached to it .
they call laughter and E@@ mot@@ ions , than be the language no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes also the opportunity to clari@@ fy their land and customs of nar@@ ration .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the b@@ abel of the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ asha in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he asked the meaning of his b@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his in@@ corporate identity :
you have heard it !
they were aware ...
they were very with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities took place , and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can be trac@@ ed into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize your own history .
Puerto Rico calls for state debt of state debt by the United States
with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars on the last April 3 , 2017 , several religious and civil organisations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ cian Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old city of San Ju@@ ans .
proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizens front for the ne@@ ural testing of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the new debt of debt has also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os demands that the politicians , officials and government agencies , responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial audit and an management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , the compensation of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay an debt that is not its own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found in pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the national alliance integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a regulated non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law relating to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside will be exp@@ elled without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

photo of the fac@@ ebook page from N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi Saf@@ adi .
the sy@@ symmet@@ ric Palestinian developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi has been missing since one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom , and recall the contributions that he has done for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : P@@ U@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , is dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France , based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ inc@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the Book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective re@@ tention ) .
the book , which was published last year and is free here , contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book wants to be structured as moves for free knowledge and what the true cost are to , with which this is connected to .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , have worked on side to view over the neb@@ ula who gives our news@@ fe@@ eds to create something sense out of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunte@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of A@@ dra in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no more information about current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice dedicated to his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , action and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we opted for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temp@@ tations of extreme poverty ?
the web developer of open source and digital activ@@ ist has been held in prison by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons as the Insider of the Assad government and presented it by an alleged death sentence against her husband on 12 November 2015 .
but his position and condition remain still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in making access to the Internet and to expand public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist , and currently over@@ ly of the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of bass @-@ cultural prototypes were predic@@ tive as the work which he started building with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civilians and there are gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not yet known that ten years after he began to work with this work , the IS would have it all of it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodies .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology , and maintenance has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
Port@@ el could not shut down this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and b@@ assist me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English good .
he always has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other in@@ ward taught English to write and to speak .
Bass@@ el has opened the gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought other in@@ doors , as they still use computers , at least in theory , without the fact that they actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have a year working together in the book .
she mu@@ te the lyrics , when she visited him and translated them out of the Syrian Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain names .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens with every visit ,
that I sing in the world of yours eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment when we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison sentence
and I , in every detail of your voice and words ,
which I carry passion with my passion ,
when your eyes may say
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all the moments ,
and over your absence to cry and to smile .
I myself surprised myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the protest of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community calls for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , the director of corruption returned to the post office after the release of corruption
mos@@ quit@@ ans re@@ acted to a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace , after half of his sentence in the workplace , where the corruption was committed .
this is the development of Di@@ geo@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 with four other def@@ endants due to failure of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza , between 2005 and 2008 .
in 2016 , Cam@@ b@@ aza was released for a good lead and immediately requested his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with the opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , re@@ loc@@ ating his old post , since the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution which sets itself for public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to set up the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and even a re@@ step in relation to the efforts of our legal systems , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware of it is that the company should have developed a discipl@@ ining of discipl@@ ines against the tra@@ des@@ people .
however , the company was silent , however , not adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ ance of social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would have been an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them did eat .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has joined the company to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm the damage .
thus it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is happy to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he rep@@ lied it , I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already revi@@ ved so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to the state and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only operated himself in the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was using the state as hand@@ ele had to become an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of this man , the pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el that a thief was in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting , and - Inci@@ dentally , Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was ener@@ ge@@ tically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is to be able to sell his own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ah said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious human being changed , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious human being de@@ crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also dis@@ appo@@ inting :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he sat for 10 years and came free .
and today the company reli@@ es on him by which he rep@@ lic@@ ated funds to come back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - has been around ( @ az@@ i _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook has been blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ill .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their Post@@ s from the net because they abst@@ ained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discus@@ sing about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ in@@ arian background or generally used as an adj@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or around the world . ( in bur@@ mes@@ an writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given an extremely valuable bank@@ note .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat human language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may today usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word at itself does not call the speech of hate .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Post@@ s , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed in doubt because of his use , cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ian words with fundamental different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter of letters such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they could eat , as he could p@@ ains his back pain by making a word game .
the set of ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the Questi@@ oning ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - res@@ embles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that she is going to reduce the language of Hass@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it del@@ etes all the post@@ ings suspected to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it will automatically filters the word .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what should be done instead , the post is carefully to analyze and control it by check them in the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sp@@ ill age ) .
the good is that these three @-@ day nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ i is spreading , preser@@ ving a pretty good lesson .
it is now time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the promotion , a strong signal may be sent to them that hate speech , may not keep the efficiency of this strategy long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often have a cat@@ - and mouse game where users can simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the scen@@ ic word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his postal as he just wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and me became the li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of Post@@ s from people who have no negative views or who are simply trying to show their opinion against Hass@@ als of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ ing :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the Post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believed that Facebook could have more to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community ask advice :
Facebook likes a well @-@ wanted intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words to cen@@ sored will bring only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it also appears as if they started without any local context or technical support and banned as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; .
even when they found that they did not have bugs , they didn &apos;t tried to read the for@@ gery .
if they have only something more respect for the 15 million benefits that had a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care for much fun under the users .
rather than to take it seriously , users have fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their Post@@ s will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , which did not abst@@ ain from hate language , but nevertheless they were removed :
with permission to be used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watching a Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the Post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal humans ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , social networks have used to have increased their voices and their influence .
among other things , the violence in social networks should heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where they disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s thousands of escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure in Hass@@ elt of Hass@@ ans on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites , crit@@ ici@@ zed .
but rather than just using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better , in context rather than on Code of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s escape is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s Parliament unanim@@ ously decided unanim@@ ously to provide this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage there were some members of Hin@@ du@@ istic and mus@@ cular religious communities on practice , and in May 2016 there came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group of members of the various religious groups of the country , did not bring to the state that the state should not be con@@ ven@@ ed , as it was , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this was imp@@ aired by the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner to the UN &apos;s Convention on Climate Change , and is defined by min@@ ors under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 showed that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Statist@@ ical Central Office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements which con@@ stri@@ ve to abol@@ ish legislation to the children , followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support . undou@@ bt@@ edly , they are waiting for this result .
nevertheless , all were not smooth .
a Hin@@ du @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children , they should have dar@@ n to worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was sor@@ cer@@ ated for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some some doub@@ ts came to agree whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contributed to the House of Represent@@ atives , so where a simple majority would be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must vote and pro@@ claim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators on Facebook has announced a Status update which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children &apos;s to@@ e was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one .
after previously decided in the Senate , the draft must now be made to the law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been finally changed to children &apos;s birthday .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was appointed Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it used too much time and unnecessary t@@ ing@@ le that spar@@ ed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s escape is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price .
while Abel &apos;s Jackson was , there was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was delighted that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of the sp@@ ouse was decided today , 9 June 2017 .
at the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 dep@@ uties and 35 were present at the vote .
all members who were against , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s to@@ e is not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ ild@@ a .
many thanks to all activists who have taken him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thank you to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
before months Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to be prosec@@ uted , the law should be adopted , and it seems to be dis@@ sol@@ ving his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , it was quite legitim@@ ately if Mahar@@ aj would like to proceed against the law , most social media users would like to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell ten@@ ds to :
Dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so general that we would have to use the state in our bedrooms , simply target that the state , our daughters before it protects , that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ mo@@ cked hus@@ bands , who may be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , if it is now too an accus@@ ation against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s children are legally legal or even the norm , although there are laws that they must say .

by mir@@ r@@ oring of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content

for over a month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for Day is clari@@ fied as important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ter and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking .
although many techniques have been acc@@ ust@@ omed to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , the most unusual Wikipedia users are not in this category .
although Turkey closed articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has held regular block@@ ades of the Internet since 2007 , after the internet act has been adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
in China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive cy@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship by Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages which reflect the content from Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( thus calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is based on the system of domain name and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is ir@@ re@@ voc@@ able despite the general prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) we put everything to place Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ op@@ org website itself .
IP@@ FS also showed that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only for screen@@ shots and not live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ urs@@ ed similar Mir@@ ror to ho@@ sten when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed .

there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy server , a Mir@@ ror .
one is att@@ acking to another URL that is not the original . that &apos;s what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents from Wikipedia itself , when they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer uses his camera to give attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ al rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were sick with po@@ or@@ able moti@@ fs and dre@@ aded colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to wear a camera with yourself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar reli@@ ed on the international stage at the age of 28 .
and its native town directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that turn attention to n@@ ep@@ ic wildlife .
he described Facebook on Facebook , as it helps in his work :
I live on the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game of wild ! !
I just stayed at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to k@@ nee pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar is stri@@ ving of cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese Nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not as vene@@ er as they look .
and he should know it , because he stood far from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be anno@@ yed from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately puts up immediately , we look forward to and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the support of Nep@@ als Nature and Wild@@ life is not always easy .
he was waiting for 22 days , and still lived in a tent in order to take up at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took up until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .

years after the wedding , Indian women invited for the first time to discuss the names of their hus@@ bands .
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing Convention .
in many parts of India there are women &apos;s greatest care to discuss the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a t@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ ab@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they should respect her husband &apos;s husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should consider the standard , this practice is alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ j@@ a by a real court and re@@ directed by her family and the village community after she had spoken a secret relations with names .
the tradition of her wives also did not act as a name , is also common among men . however , they are far better to worry if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them healthcare professionals and hou@@ se@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main event theme of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , in which they discuss the fine arts of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
when one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian countries , is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is located in the exploitation of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of intern@@ ships , such as the pedi@@ gre@@ ate to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads this club .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they also made them to the amb@@ ass@@ adors of mur@@ ders at the same time .
the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini show in their discussion group , did women who do not call her hus@@ bands .
she decided on this subject , because it wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
the name of her hus@@ bands do not talk loud , is a brilli@@ ance to keep it guilty and never put into question .
raw material mean :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t think this will be regarded as a female , as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deep roots that we have never made this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning of the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have previously named Roh@@ ini , who has never called his husband to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
raw ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me and said I should name him from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion lu@@ b with this self confidence in luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ ying , sad , loving , and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , is that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought the name of her husband on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a century @-@ old tradition , in which women married women &apos;s names never to speak .
raw ini tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise only occurred before itself ; another decided to leave the whole fru@@ str@@ ations against him and his family by taking it off .
the expression on her face was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ce about it , with an ancient bread , the women decided that they actually would actually try to call her hus@@ bands during the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they had in the head : his wife did not stop to tell his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was afraid , she was afraid , saying that there was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a group of participants was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation was carried out in force .
raw ini reports how women tries to stop other practices , such as the car@@ ving of interest of interest on the fore@@ head , which shows the sp@@ ic@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the nu@@ cle@@ us red point if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I stopped to carry him .
the other women have not stopped doing so , but mine , they are now in a better position , but to be able to bear him in some days .
for many women , the discussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip at every discussion lu@@ b .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure that what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake and che@@ eks and che@@ eks and talking about things about whom they had never done before .
raw ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have also been talking about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities have been linked to our hus@@ bands , never as honest .
it feels great , certain things to say loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have driven us about the concept of honor and connected to clothing .
some women in the group have applied only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is the okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ta @-@ cur@@ ta , a large shirt about a p@@ ants ; they have not grown .
after a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of the own wardrobe , the Mor@@ al connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ding Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could wear it .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
to the question whether in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things get slowly into roles :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tested it a few times , but they left again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are .
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - as the f@@ eil@@ ing for more motion freedom or the own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , it is deliber@@ ately to sit in the same boat .
how raw ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club is each of us to change that something is changing .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when any woman enters the club home and other people concerning it , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was founded ( Beatles Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , with many fans remin@@ ders and their appreci@@ ation for the Beatles .
the Beatles visit to the Beatles in 1966 was regarded as the revers@@ al of the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , which was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , noted for the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese way through .
human beings here is quite clear that they had no choice to receive any other than the Beatles with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the sole propriet@@ or Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! &quot; today the Beatles of commem@@ oration is in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs were sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English @-@ lessons at Japanese secondary schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today Beatles Memorial Day is .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should do or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japan also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places that related to the band .
- When you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit !
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ ril enough :
good morning together .
today Beatles Memorial Day is .
exactly this day in 1966 The Beatles arrived in Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same in the past year .
and of course some companies use the fan base as well as market interest rates , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ! today Beatles have a memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; today and I will eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

com@@ it@@ ational men are deported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that believing men could be in Mozambique destination .

a new system of the kidn@@ apping of glorious group persons for the organisation trading , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called for a range of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and in the consequence they had stood that the organs of Sch@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a glorious man had gold , or might bring riches , explained the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
a further group , the aim of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to examine these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who pre @-@ travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le males , who are travelling to Mozambique travel health attacks , the mos@@ quit@@ ous police warned against the latest murder of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where these victims were arrested .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the South of Mozambique , said that the local police have already proved the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of believing men .
the persecution and killing of glorious individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ vil@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ als , this will take advantage of the police in the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also might have been a faith according to the victims of the head , the wealth of riches .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair transplan@@ t problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ c poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa who noted that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is opposite to Mozambique :
I like to wish E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT I would like to challenge sex against good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which the teachers would take care of good notes , and other achievements , a nation in which the people would like to make their bread , a country in which the al@@ bin@@ os should be ch@@ ased for super@@ st@@ itious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; which aim to get to high @-@ speed wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomena , some have not left the opportunity for ma@@ yed humor .

we are deeply affected by experienced death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mour@@ ned for him and speak our deeply con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , actively in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took the Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) a key role in it to extend access to the public and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community and participated in our Arabian blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bass@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by people who spend themselves as the Insider of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been condemned to death , but did not give any further information .
Bass@@ el &apos;s stay and Constitution have been unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , as N@@ our@@ a from Syrian officials announced that he was executed in 2015 .
today and future , we show the honor of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been used for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , over 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , like the organisation of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime were arrested or viol@@ ently suspended , torture and even exec@@ utions are suspended .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians came to death , as the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made until recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has taken attention to the international community that had announced his lawyer at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( Staats@@ end@@ omet@@ ry ) , after having responded to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that requested the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal issue , &quot; and a speaker told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China still ob@@ tains calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to allow treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , other countries are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
one speaker rejected it , however , to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable the treatment of li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister of Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ inging have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us liberation .
the relationship between China and Norway was moving into Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u although the Norwegian government announced that this would eventually do nothing with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to return to China , as the exports have been completely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the message that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , it was not able to increase its price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she took in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we are expecting to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
you should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans said to him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , as long as it was possible to help him in its gen@@ esis . &quot;
an spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message to the Chinese authorities to allow the Chinese authorities to allow not only Li@@ u to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the petition of the US Embassy drew a w@@ ailing response from China to itself , with the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to be united and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom like travel talks and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have received according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Senate Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally free .
I challenge China to allow Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally free to proceed to a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support is that he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the News Agency ( Reuters ) that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex around Li@@ u could be sur@@ passed the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked to provide an appropriate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
Li@@ us attor@@ ney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u Ms , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital , and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada calls for China to protect his international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and allow to release their rights to the exercise of this rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China to allow for humanitarian reasons on June 29 to open for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures have to be seized to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , independent where , whether they want to contact his wife and his family .
although the news broad@@ caster France Info reported that the French government would be welcomed Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was known that France will not find further information if France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of Fest@@ spiele in Taiwan called for China on 27 June , allowing Li@@ u to allow a greater tolerance compared to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called for China to allow the intellectual Li@@ u to treat himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very careful in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was strictly punished , would have led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable , and we@@ al@@ thy China , what would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and law @-@ nation@@ alities in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question is stup@@ id that Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark was triggered in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the International Women &apos;s Association of the State of New York , the Minister knew that many people crit@@ ici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to rotate the logic , to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , we can say that we were finally no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight prior to the responsibilities , a compulsory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is then ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ amal@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he appeared to be unt@@ rue .
by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the subject point of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ itarian mach@@ est@@ ants appears to be the previous Democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in the final result , in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ amal@@ gam , answers to his American guests regarding our press , our j@@ udi@@ ative , our political system is really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions conf@@ essed it with non @-@ answers r@@ ational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam to clear his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a land , but it is a city , so that the country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful when our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ ageous would take it to clear this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comments concerning the critics that you should start to read the full address of the conference , so that you could even understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ gam , according to that Singapore was a city and no country .
read the heading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ important , even if we are looking for free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he distributed Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party of decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not exist in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ amal@@ gam working as leader of a firm @-@ growing generation , such as such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that expects me - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have no doubt and I &apos;m not sure that he really believes that he is really associated with what he def@@ ends .
the T@@ EM@@ AS@@ EK Review dis@@ assembled the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ gu@@ amal@@ gam committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cable , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ g@@ gam are serious importance .
why do people do more than their military service , do not defend their own city , but not their land ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the reference , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have been off@@ ended with many people ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not really correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his Ed@@ itors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question , which is placed in Japan on the most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation , the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partners by providing personal questions .
in my clar@@ et it usually follows the standard reply : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans may cook from W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans , but does not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was , when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons in us !
gay marri@@ ages are legal in Canada already since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red a lot .
it would account for me , if one would replace me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
fir@@ stly , as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to as &quot; nice &quot; to be to be sp@@ aw@@ less , but trag@@ ically important figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a private Canadian double gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really was a nation of people such as N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward in fact , but the actual problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this may be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that around one around .
I would even go to say that the desire is free and to be one of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what can be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool polit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we are missing the warm @-@ heart@@ y , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice . &apos; our prime minister has left Canada just right .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ac Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous Pop band has published a music video published by the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in 2014 , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him who makes himself his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continuing military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the j@@ unta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook was divided into 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists informed the public .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it is able to keep by the country under the Jun@@ ta domin@@ ation .
look at once these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that have been committed to Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which was given to the Commander in Chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous programme of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politics and other people who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by authorities to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content monitors and persons accused of having accused of having denied the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict marriage against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , a war was declared in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , their decision is buying U @-@ boats , although security experts compl@@ ained that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax .
in the video it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans before being thrown into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they have caused the confusion of &quot; confusion &quot; in society and have long adher@@ ence to the monarchy , they should keep the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band , showing the Sal@@ ut of &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war company re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Pacific , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian War ended , but its sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians living and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there lived even more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these vul@@ tures .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the overall population of the district took 16,000 people after it had hardly risen above a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , which are called Chr@@ onic ch@@ kov@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically situated for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; it all is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do you talk ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
the village was full of life before the war .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there are only paved road with heavy spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and maintained its contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union in the meantime .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .
the Chr@@ onic ch@@ ak@@ kas , which is still one or two families , one recogni@@ zes in the balconies where they are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they come back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed something to her friend and suddenly leaving the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( farming products for property requirements ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district authority provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago he moved to the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ant G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Bar@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells you .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither any kind of vegetables , it is hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ alya &apos;s tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holiday are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
during her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call T@@ ant G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Conference parties in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and her five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they re@@ members the village right before the war .
despite the relatives that live in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke out ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; it explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children each child for every child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ al &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens .
she tells that it was initially a very afraid situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people .
it can be used to all .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived just as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball is flying out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased after him .
he plays with the ball , then sc@@ roll down the hill .
a group of children persecuted the ball now .
while they run , some of them cast stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which ensure un@@ certainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 at the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ est@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is guided by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a little woman with a cor@@ k @-@ pink brilli@@ antly and gold colored ear@@ ring in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown up there . yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , br@@ ushed walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance hall there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez also tells you people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you M@@ om Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes .
they don &apos;t want to re@@ ject our own .
they also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it is too her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston , to find her husband and her three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States to make a normal stop in South America and then go to the north .
the family had heard from other way@@ far@@ ers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often traveling the track and that Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his departure , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest for M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the required money to buy the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never let it go , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests will send their often text messages when they went to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that your Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know far beyond Africa , but their guests have brought to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps here very well known , but she is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l de sa@@ w@@ asse to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family visited migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the ro@@ bes will be sold to many African migrants too expensive .
he began to help them to get an appropriate price , and he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on ceilings on the ground but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experienced .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after three years since he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through tap@@ est@@ ula comes from central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to kill him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a sole , has its roof offered to him .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the course , travelers enjoy quietly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of them that have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she loves her album with numerous photos .
there are one of their daughter with African hair@@ dres@@ sers that you have made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and elderly .
she laughs sad , while she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya &apos;s fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on its cell@@ phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , built @-@ in @-@ end .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on its mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Tian@@ shan district of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it refers to the district government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the release of communication , the app &quot; Connect &quot; to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ills the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app with a private We@@ chat group .
in the notification made by the police , the app can determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , by online fr@@ aud , tro@@ j@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online and to control your own home network .
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; remote players or even h@@ ack@@ ers could be manipul@@ ating or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announc@@ ements concerning digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly concentrated on the experience of users in major cities in the East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ate Internet downstream operations .
the news based on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( pool @-@ hem@@ at@@ ched ) , which was cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen then checked the residents , if they had installed the surveillance app .
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are interested in a check@@ point with one device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of captivity due to the rest of the awak@@ ening technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( built @-@ in @-@ course ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift a Windows operating system to receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the city council coun@@ sel@@ ing to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government offices , authorities and the party associations , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instruction of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , portable hard drives , lap@@ tops and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and they viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million people , and gives them pen@@ alties for a full range of other verses , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political noti@@ fications .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es to Death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you will see yourself and you know that you &apos;re all alone in one place where everything is missing .
everything has been dissolved after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth reveals that clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to her name .
one that has found in a list of feelings and press down , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality brings you back and you looked behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - the characters in beings from meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt dis@@ solves in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the storm . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls , who have built your parents here , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have not arrested me and arrested my father three times , but that was not enough for me to form &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Council it formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us in proof , that even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn out during a peaceful protests like the dar@@ n@@ el in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to play the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ cry .
all the city district is cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , rain @-@ free , at the wrong time , even if I did not meet any high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things were a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends feel good enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends gathered to me , we found ourselves with a splendid picture that had filled my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you delivered the Spirit out of the lamp but it is simply not interested in Ger@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to your voice after you have taken your way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me hear how you &apos;re &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only bra@@ ve enough to cry out , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes were filled with me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t mourn what to look to me in my eyes , and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my foolishness , vanity . perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my thing as I answered : &quot; I had not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never heard to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regre@@ t the word that I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same is a single and his father like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with that . &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cursed lies in the nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a sec@@ ular torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ ams the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
afterwards again by the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I remind me of all details , before I looked around the room .
otherwise , they were probably assigned a larger cell for me this time .
I have to share it with only one another cap@@ tives and may immediately put me immediately , without any permission to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I re@@ trac@@ ed back to an old established communication method : to beat the wall with its f@@ ist .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; awak@@ ening &quot; .
he did not tell me after long c@@ ops .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells there was an unknown man middle age who looks like me and is called the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no markings fac@@ ial features can be seen in me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may someone , whose voice like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers can be connected to its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would fre@@ t him if I tar@@ ry .
liar .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s that lab@@ s in the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
out of the distance , I still hear it &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always in order to kill this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the hor@@ ror into person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; att@@ aching to 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
this was the mystery to be ventil@@ ated : to protect the government security before us and prevent the tra@@ itor and the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ch dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fessional card and conf@@ used the narrow eye view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I looked for the audi@@ ences and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and ador@@ ned man ; at least he comes before me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions that you are still young , you can join so much important thing with your life than to join this diary and to protest demonstrations , which will soon be found at the end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly discussion has become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me , that , or bad I had to acc@@ ust@@ omed to be punished , though I had done nothing to earn these sentence .
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker enjoys a pleasure in your cry .
give him the pleasure of pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you can &apos;t return your cri@@ es .
my cry fell not enough , so they ex@@ chang@@ ers the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked for earlier times as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether it was one of the normal work equipment .
they had four wires in one another to present us from their sight , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all my soul in my body - and my voice is why I stopped to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and did not take a pleasure in mind , so it was the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through all the body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ nu@@ de body , that was out@@ stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back there .
after two horri@@ fying hours he decided that he had to fulfill his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed away , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhau@@ st@@ ible young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you shall be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !

with his music , which often continues with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poems , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these subjects are not only found in his home town in Amman , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria until all to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits , and he can feel according to their own statement with people who have among the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not open it frank@@ ly , he turns against the U.S. foreign policy a special dis@@ solution .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war@@ fare , anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ bran@@ ce of the second generation &quot; - so he himself describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I do not think of my own life , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think I am a man , while he flo@@ ats in water dissolved N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , she has a cup of coffee in a sen@@ su@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically the stro@@ kes speak warm coffee and the scarf of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it &apos;s easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan it was to drink in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ i had canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committees that support the Islamic State &apos;s Front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual Fron@@ ti@@ fier Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country contradic@@ ts and the main reason for the concert .
the MPs and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN says that the concert was cancelled &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim also , the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , who pos@@ es the un@@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to be decided &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply s@@ essed Rh@@ et@@ ori@@ k , but actually a clearly @-@ cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the fact that in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly stated .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional line@@ age in her body , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ des@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of an evi@@ d@@ led un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust .
over the past few years in Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ mor@@ de &apos;s &quot; - the un@@ official outside .
according to human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ mor@@ de in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan became institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support adequate nature .
according to a law on the Crime of Crime in 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of in@@ humane violence are kept , &quot; and for their release , often a years of bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , not to rever@@ t topics that are in its country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b suggests that his work is political , however , that he is his music , the full exp@@ on@@ ite accumulation on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , is not able to split politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I came into politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed &apos; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus again on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically active in the core .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind market in which one can get in his words , &quot; that can be what you want &quot; - whether faith or un@@ belief , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ cies or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan via the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T + -@@ individuals still heavily ass@@ aul@@ ted in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments from the context was torn , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but he only became a working version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b calls open to the Arab LGB@@ T + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als is not speaking to Islam .
he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ er , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still remained in memory today because of its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ de , who later began to work on behalf of the cali@@ pers , in the eighth century , is open to homosexu@@ ality , why is Jord@@ anian not this ?
the real problem , such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government postpon@@ ed attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive votes will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government members and members of the Teacher Association , with the reas@@ oning , they would have been critical in favour of social media to be related to the problems that were deeply @-@ related to corruption .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is that only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian .
for him , progress is a ste@@ ady and take advantage of Jordan . M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is now ready for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - it is sure that these changes from day to day take place at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , were of abroad , an Arab world without interventions .
he is not only dreamed of bringing his work to Baghdad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region may act with the aid of music , art and literature of real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , spreading un@@ itions and on artificial kind . at least , he hopes that .
so far as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ emble himself and therefore also aff@@ ord resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually taken up in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory is that the car , the drums , and dancing for more than a thousand years have been delivered and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ ishi in the k@@ nee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a couple of great places , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l ) .
I &apos;m looking forward to the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival offers the only true - and another stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was here and gave me the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the views of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and encourage a legitim@@ ate profession like the H@@ air@@ flow .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru was experienced - as many other middle and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ dres@@ sers of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ dres@@ sers .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts in each other to show everyone who can see the ec@@ centric li@@ lies , as you can see in the following video ( other videos for current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to preserve their weapons in hair@@ dressing arts , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the benefits of dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in front of the school year in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the congregation and the district which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ er &quot; Liebes@@ message to Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who know ?
is it not yet more important , people who feel out @-@ out , aff@@ ecting to accommodate li@@ king ?
just this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ciliation ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to do with gu@@ err@@ illa @-@ fought letters .
only recently , her country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( deutsch : revolutionary forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the president of Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its in 2005 .
before the Colom@@ bian , however , a long way is still a long way , until they can speak of a real reconciliation and of peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa @-@ soldier , who lived for many years in illegal wareh@@ ouses , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out around the clock , and have to integrate them into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now support them in their ranks and support it in a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian we were convinced that the young column were to join the integration process and to help the integration process .
and exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to be welcomed them again in society .
the campaign &apos;s aim is to provide 6@@ 900 letters - one of the former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who are to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love to write in the Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who want to do much needed .
he bought , he told , in this year he was able to share his love with people who needed in the most urgent consideration .
so , the plan , letters full of hope and support for the former fighter of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course from a story of war to a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ ica traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the F@@ ARC members did so , as they did before , to make the prec@@ epts of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters fully supported by people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between &quot; said the student student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ Code &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the gu@@ err@@ illas live in ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate was a deadly weapon for the sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful roll .
never before my life has been written in my life , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly I cried out the tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , so tired of all the years of faithful companions to be this cal@@ mer , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was one of the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of famine . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now , I know that there is a company outside , that wait for us with open arms .
now I have learned to cope with weapons until now .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together to a discussion round .
students were all grown up as the war , and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the Leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their belie@@ fs about the peace process : &quot; many years long have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to develop our society in this country .
for a goal of this magn@@ itude it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never found hearing , and to recogn@@ ise that people who I have seen often as monsters and even hate , just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their lives and the environment was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , would hurt me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - even those who have killed and have done so much harm to us , and can give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote an example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was prophesied that after the dis@@ armament of peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest their rights and to protest their rights ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the De@@ fen@@ ders of Peace - regardless of race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - themselves of all those who live from a country in war dream .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord to our post and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ic@@ sum@@ owa and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual men and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical , sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with terror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months about persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ist on the local LGB@@ T community , is not only made about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a tran@@ ss@@ exual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what happened in the republic .
the LGB@@ T legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya before several months ago conqu@@ ers the international head@@ lines , after reports that the towing , torture and slaughter of que@@ er men in the Republic of thematic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities that susp@@ ects susp@@ icious men and arrested them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
as early as her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which was why they moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from gender equality , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the USA last time .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunte@@ er hel@@ pers at a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who encoun@@ tered in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her to help me , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ sh@@ echn@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can fix this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos taken from my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App took the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a couple of shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man@@ ure : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned back I felt anything in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on the sh@@ atter@@ y : &quot; how long will you honor the family , you sn@@ ug@@ get ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened last grand@@ age in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get together and began to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses you have been laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there stands still my male name ; but the doctor arose and put me to the women .
I am grat@@ eful to him for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his brush , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he found himself as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has been respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they call me , wrote to me - relatives , foreign , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ life .
my family has been visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that this was a lie .
they found absur@@ d claims : some said to me that I must prove it up by the roads ; others wanted me that I had not changed my sex at Gro@@ z@@ ny &apos;s official television that I had not changed my sex , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic .
we can &apos;t touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid a cord around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and already a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it happened for the third time it was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my people of human rights tested the number@@ ing pictures - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how do you have fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ believ@@ able .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it , without record , without registration , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ igner .
I raised the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , only because you have left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you are on . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you standing in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , but this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
but some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements can still be found in me .
so much I wish I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier .
I say always , that , as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with the camera , I give I really effort to see how the person commemor@@ ate it out of their past - so remember my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who took one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan it was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ gets .
OC Media : are now even pregnant men captured in these secret products ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me , there wouldn &apos;t be much too many .
if , then , especially those who have no significant relatives or dropped from their relatives to set up the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be held there to present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should you be converted , they will show her body in television and claim to attack them any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people don &apos;t have disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped , to ra@@ dically alize them .
OC Media : is this only a mistake or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have gone in this prison after her be@@ ard was grown .
there have been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken into account when these people were taken .
however , they were not introduced as band members until now , so far there were no reports yet . however , we guess that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave with these people ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation which took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still alive - and I had never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more saf@@ er than now .
Russia wanted to don@@ ate us to the &quot; civi@@ liz@@ ations &quot; but finally rejected us into the quar@@ ry .
OC Media : what is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had coloured lashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Department of Security of the Sch@@ aria never worked with me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we never were ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ ase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often say to children if they have fun with sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed you will be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never before h@@ unted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period mean ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak in television over Mor@@ al .
he spoke not on us per se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people began to change in the city .
those who had previously tre@@ bled and laugh@@ ed at once , he looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic steadily s@@ lim@@ itated .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the U.S. not much .
apart from that I am still active as a activists .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , coll@@ ars , I buried her to the hospital and help them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t forget any Cent .
I have discovered these people themselves , when I cut off the refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ lover .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is just the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to do with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the Russians also have which Russians also have them ; on all planets , there are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , therefore it is very pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here as many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and live during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ y of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sting .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact , different life settings .
it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
do not know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I personally become so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I myself am .
local groups war@@ n for an increase of suicide in the ver@@ po@@ ver@@ aged Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i retired on August 27 , the desp@@ air situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under an@@ xiety , depression , and he sh@@ ed@@ ding himself for his own help to come up the in@@ ability for his family , like Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
a video on YouTube made the moments after he had kindled himself .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only self @-@ committed suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists say that even more men could take this life .
the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ay@@ am Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ ad@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have started .
their stories have a matter : there were all family fathers , who felt in due to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to pursue their families to feed and secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is located in most of Iran &apos;s living Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population to contest their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and continued in 1925 his efforts to termin@@ ate ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
there are some of the largest oil and gas areas in Iran in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resource , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the indigenous population will get only little from that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and kidn@@ app@@ ings .
the Iranian regime refused to condemn the Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a wide range of dem@@ ics built by the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are .
these dem@@ me have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused devast@@ ation and local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k yo@@ ungst@@ ers now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Irish director of Ko@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a work , completed an elementary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... to destroy the Spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial eth@@ ical discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of years in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the processing phase :
as officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arabian workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be able to access to all sectors in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood from their home to Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their way and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , because even the Arabic name may not be toler@@ ated on the workplace , because the speaking of Arabic language or the horse @-@ Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances which have to endure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ates alarm , before the situation become explosive .
it remains to wait if the world w@@ akes up and assumes that .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ici@@ de@@ able is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do not I identify with the femin@@ ism , also with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was an object of several discussions where many different positions came to express .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , so many women - especially white women who design@@ ate themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even consider well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be Fem@@ inist * in general .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men .
that women still remain under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later encounter a gl@@ aze blan@@ ket earlier or later in various areas of life an gl@@ aze blan@@ ket , and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware of and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I have to talk to skin colour , on black c@@ is women , on black C@@ is women , on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I remember what kind we have physically , sec@@ ular and verb@@ al ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
however , however , all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing &quot; their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexual violence an institutional form of ramp@@ ant violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ as and women earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are often rejected by the school as white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ ears and women are exposed to a higher risk of developing domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all women , all men and all men each neither skin colour the same rights . on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect me as a black woman to take into account the white woman who ref@@ uses to take care of both gender as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer be strug@@ gling with my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere which strug@@ gled to me and countless other black women and again rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner mour@@ ned in her speech in 1851 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refused to receive a ide@@ ology in which the black women in historical ways is an in@@ human and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join the group@@ ings that additionally , through cultural events , our customs and customs , to drive up their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ centric program .
I will not try to consider white women the importance of the over@@ throwing of skin colour and sex . for some of them continue to keep the significance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism Femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded to conce@@ al women from different houses and conce@@ al from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to release myself full of femin@@ ism and to join the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism movement , which was founded for my dark skin and my status as a woman &apos;s life instead of a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent , that inter@@ section is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women looking to our own ideas and join us to the sphere which we created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we define ourselves ) , we can defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be ad@@ mi@@ red , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I &apos;m recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m as part of my dark skin and due to my being as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life did not survive , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ eting against pollution : the mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here again .
he traveled to Mai@@ a in the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern due to the Kurdistan region of Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who tells us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its congregation .
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war , the construction of dust ship@@ pers , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate aqu@@ atic crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which seeks to protect the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist , produced in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq .
the centre of its work lies on ver@@ ing , little major sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operating vide@@ ography and new multi@@ media techniques , with whose help oppressed churches to tell their stories in their way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and worked version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ toral . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ de @-@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) that reports about the green@@ ish tw@@ elle against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people concerned .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , who had become violent partner who could have been violent .
since the end of its relationship has passed some time and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was reported due to mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , also the academic advertisement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second woman withdrew its ad .
difficult to break the Devil &apos;s threat against women is difficult .
if women are not at all time , they generally do not receive support by the State .
in many cases women are also dependent on the men that they har@@ assed . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence to participate in the prosecution of criminal authorities .
contents and Statistics 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that nothing under@@ imm@@ ing 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ ments laws : good approach , faulty implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mist@@ re@@ ated , says My@@ cel@@ Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the researcher for Gen@@ der@@ in@@ quire at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports which show not even the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; says it .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney 9@@ 600 went for domestic violence . over 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of ads came by women .
there were over 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads were found here .
in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women , women and physical abuse were said , 55 % of women said of mental mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
however , statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ ak@@ ay@@ ischen Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i are actually shown only a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; on every woman who will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who are subject to physical abuse , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is no exception that the prosecution authorities cannot document appropri@@ ately , how many women become murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 counts of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence through men .

in@@ visi@@ bly mist@@ re@@ acts and a legal system that does not under@@ take
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became a strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all their former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then , after that , she should always regre@@ t it .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but two years , she carried the mental force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable the most difficult :
I have never thought that I would be a victim of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it in earlier , I always thought that the only women have happened to sub@@ ordin@@ ate , because they can be dis@@ astro@@ us by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two years relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to show that his behaviour was a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they did so long by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ acts had at least a certain contribut@@ or to bl@@ ame .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was mist@@ re@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women all in some way victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
in the group , they can speak with others on their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women serious .
in Victori@@ an case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to convince her to convince her that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Victori@@ an advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against their former partners , who developed into an un@@ fair legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and the influence of their former Partners .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ments laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the mist@@ re@@ acts of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , provides great problems with the laws of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ ff ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ inist to become a independent pen@@ dic@@ ate and har@@ der how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature has changed in some point to win even the MPs for the law , they were afraid that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions are generally prohibited in Paraguay with up to five years in jail .
the original bill had intended to charge the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process , which have to bear the victims of violence even if it just want to restore and secure accommodation to the State .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature is not liable to sufficient financial funds for this purpose :
in Paraguay mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is seen as part in human relationships .
here , a re@@ think is to take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a little ones .
in view of these facts , he pleaded not guilty , and helps the perpet@@ rators come out .
we need to make this long viewing until failure is no more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was passed to the par@@ ak@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage has been cancelled , which called for domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes going apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered great set@@ backs .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to ass@@ ert attacks
&quot; this website has been closed due to a resolution of the information Secretary &quot; on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ an@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arabian newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage about corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he served a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed before the court and returned to court later .
in 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had depos@@ ed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Chief of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the s@@ ult@@ ans &apos; domin@@ ation is characterized by the be@@ ating efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dated and imprisoned .
the authorities restric@@ ting peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights system@@ atically a and hin@@ dered citizens , also activists , their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was prohibited by authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , concluded that in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to the Justice &quot; was published . in this , there went corruption in judicial decisions and the mixing of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a verdict in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : fac@@ ebook page from Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested in Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Legal Committee , and ISS 1000 prior to the special department and was arrested by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the representative of Chief Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j that led to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ ine as Chief Editor .
the newspaper was concluded in@@ definitely after the information ministers had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spreading of the newspaper on every way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ grave took place the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both amongst others , were sentenced to mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mine of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found in addition to the violation of an audience of publication and s@@ lander was found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of adher@@ es and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , a one @-@ year vocational prohibition against both journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he could represent the use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set on 22 August 2016 and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court said Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the remainder of his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his 18 @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appeals Court also abolished the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself to be suspended until attacks by the om@@ an@@ ic government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister received a statement that was extended by three months with the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , confir@@ ming the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was injured .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operations .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to an extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ an@@ ic authorities to :
1. You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j re@@ mot@@ ely dischar@@ ged and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure with his permission .
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need on @-@ run medical research , there are two reasons : a lack of medic@@ ations and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
ill@@ nesses such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have a serious impact in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa widely as elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases is a big problem .
sec@@ on@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , is the development of its own research capacity in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS Epi@@ de@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
when Post@@ doc researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he worked on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of media relating to these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks to be private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed differently .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it enough ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who go back or move here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special scientific education , starting at every age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research on space , healthcare ( non transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the access to scientific expertise that reflect this challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers worldwide change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports about solution for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been producing sal@@ ads in the USA since the 1980s .
its company has 114 sorts , such as the example , the first plant that has been grown and cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ aut in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only affected by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question as many sal@@ ads have been able to get bound@@ aries .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual types but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ or or Thor@@ ton or curved leaves .
in recent years more , more of such patents have been registered in more plants such as cere@@ al or cart@@ els . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and atomic facts ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , M@@ orton requires more sal@@ ads , but now it takes longer , because his work is increasingly difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better than that , in a river , there would be a b@@ oul@@ ders , in order to get the g@@ ond@@ olas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a breach of the growing tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents will go to sal@@ ads too far .
and if they stand before the Court , no one can breed no new salad @-@ sor@@ b because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to figure out those features that he would like .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is protected as a intellectual property .
it also has been connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; re@@ bre@@ eders ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman sal@@ at in the &quot; glas@@ shou@@ ses &quot; the station far@@ med and eaten . there will be tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name rather sounds as it would come from the IT range and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspir@@ ing from the motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and animals are not protected as a intellectual property and are therefore durable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , O@@ ss@@ i is called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could also commit that others can use the seed @-@ free seed for them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to make shops and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; Bre@@ eders allow only to cross their seeds to cross it as their own varieties , and not immediately stop them - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant materials .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ iss@@ ful prospects
Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little to use with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not to buy food products in the global farm industry , whose most recent examples are offered to farmers in the global agriculture industry , as it is said for example in farmers markets , it should also know that the way is bred to themselves , like that vegetables are bred , is threatened .
nutrition su@@ peri@@ ority without seed sovereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide other seeds still free to provide their seed in contrast to seed , seed and plant features .

O@@ ss@@ i Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous mental intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted , un@@ parall@@ eled shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in its doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ ograph@@ s have been protected as a intellectual property , making it either not even more usable for plant bre@@ eders .
there are such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by bra@@ ve that mass@@ aging large plants as wheat in even larger style are coated as a salad or carrots .
a question of sight
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted attributes - from such a way through which their taste or their color improves up to such , because of them flour@@ ish in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patients on plant properties indicates that the available plant material for bre@@ eders with more patents decreases . genetic diversity is currently more than ever before , because the changing conditions are much worse than ever before .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to know that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four inter@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture , the company has held the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property include other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant varied innovations promote &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method on the same result .
such protection is in@@ hib@@ ited as innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton considers the different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , surely no innovations will be .
and if you have to wait so long for plants to be adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the fight would have been lost .
the main argument for M@@ orton requires that genetic resources always have been a general public and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ocular inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers doing their work .
that is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to use it if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , M@@ orton considers the concept to be patented , plant features : &quot; we are creating the characteristics not really self .
they form themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who cultiv@@ ate a variety , also breeding his own values in it .
those who believes on industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for which cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides are needed , breeding in his varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , the majority of smaller seed companies , also without having patents - either rests they or keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ mun@@ ching or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton looks for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders by the A@@ void of plant patients innov@@ atively : &quot; it looks as if I was able to produce new , more pot@@ ent as a company that is patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you will be protected for 20 years before competition , so it is easy to make it very nice . &quot;
although the US seems to be leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , supporting a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed shops . the farmers work together with farmers , helping them to breeding new varieties to fulfill the specific requirements .
it also supports it to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and to sell their own .
the German organization Em@@ col works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for bre@@ aches differ from land to land , no one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . this means that they are allowed against the current practice of the European Patent Office , based on conventional crops .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards re@@ orientation of seed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the organization is currently providing a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to seed seed and biodiversity worldwide , to publish the Se@@ ed map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ential - a combination of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represents a report that farmers must have the opportunity to improve seeds and improve seed policy , making it a stable supply with food products .
in the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods is mainly stu@@ ff@@ ed where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try now to clear the people even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government closed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that .
in August , the Network released a statement on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the World Network for Human Rights Information Contin@@ uous despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution , which is never so difficult to track these goals , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome these goals , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome the blocking , and do not re@@ prove to fulfil our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news about the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ speaking network of Al Jazeera for the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

next to AN@@ HR@@ I also exists in the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of Columbus and articles , which he has not on the access sites and media in Egypt .
now , the blog which he established to circum@@ vent the census of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also is native to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student prot@@ ector and recorded a video like police physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly turning to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook @-@ comment , Zi@@ ada expressed its counter@@ part through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blo@@ gs of the blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , then it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blo@@ gs blo@@ gs , as well as every other web page that I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked Him , and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) the Egyptian authorities published 133 websites from May 24th to August 06 . these are technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , amongst others orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE , also documented the distortion of providers by le@@ ver@@ ing Internet ens@@ or@@ ship and private sur@@ fers , so called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12th of June , we realized how the blocking of websites run by VP@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and to fil@@ tering the Egyptian users may have access .
the situation will also be slo@@ ped that the force decisions were taken behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using which they can proceed against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?

day for Day , in Brazil , newspapers from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of several postcard shows .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se @-@ stressed financial situation the Gew@@ al@@ tw@@ elle reached the highest stand for 10 years in Rio .
as Global Justice , Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation called for the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least take the manager of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio popular newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16th , article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world , like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to say : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to conclude that we did not close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Chief Editor of the Newspaper , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a mar@@ ru@@ ster in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
the same video explains a journalist in the newspaper that according to the data of the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when he is dist@@ orted , can also be used to interro@@ gate cru@@ is@@ ers of the police , which is fir@@ med and then asks questions to conce@@ al .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the term &quot; War &quot; become more than they profit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira . this is in their opinion according to justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult , responsible for the responsibility of the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown on the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in staff , ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ feit detection of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just his capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent city in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no such cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rate per federal state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .

this safety measures also belonged to the formation of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 whose goal is to conquer the fav@@ ela by using a massive police offering and to keep a unit permanently there .
initially , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP was actually protecting over re@@ lics and repression against the poor municipalities that should virtually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly below .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio draws war also serious consequences for people .
for this calls on the state to use means and paths which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of an &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; mis@@ erable balls . &quot;
war on or , fact , fact that the inhabitants of Fav@@ el@@ as will continue to continue in Rio .
one week it is now that the police fired up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident became head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime compared to loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir Y@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
in particular , the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack involving chemical weapons resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investig@@ ative investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre was executed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these were standing by the rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under siege , which led to the inhabitants caused by tunn@@ els and control points through tunn@@ els and control points .
through the years of lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade become traditional food products such as meat un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ action , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mia teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO Al @-@ Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria , they are only extreme rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food , however , makes her a attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direct line of the project , subscription N@@ ad , said about the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushroom because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project has been known , and pressed his relief that it now wins more and more &quot; to gain popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in agreement with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near .
it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families of knowledge to the plant@@ ation of pilgrims , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is targeted at altern@@ ators who keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally manufactured greenhouse gases are used , to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of the Mus@@ h@@ ers &quot; regions , before they checked their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards , they planted a small pan @-@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now she designed a &quot; lec@@ tu@@ bing farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms over East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute the fung@@ al breeding for several reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread of a culture of self supply by food waste ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food@@ stu@@ ffs .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to distribute this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to help people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that assi@@ mil@@ ated in the North of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which are monitored by the forest areas by satellite , in 2017 alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) October 15 , 2017

the conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able tragedy
the objective of the protests by the Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people wonder@@ ed why the civil protection was not able to em@@ ulate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did somewhere : there are dozens of open reports from open streets , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , there could happen a similar tragedy like in June , because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will take place in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ance with a high fire of fire .
a far @-@ strong proposal on the wal@@ let , which had launched the government after heavy fires in 2003 and 2005 , was attacked by the Commun@@ es , who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law en@@ forced the case of necessity when the applicant had an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , themselves , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie , according to fires of this species .
this problems will be added that the website of the civil protection from Portugal on 15th and 16th of October , sought to contact information or attempted to contact offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information regarding the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so decisive that the server pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who did not stand alone : there were more than half a million .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in one night in autumn 1994 , the Taliban began in Afghanistan by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ahu group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan was in Afghanistan to a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in G@@ haz@@ ni province , for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say so at that time , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning of grey the boy was to break .
his uncle would bring him up and bring him to the p@@ res .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly sh@@ am@@ eless .
the Taliban continued for their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ ks found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . work was heavily and made him ill .
then did he , what was left of his small wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ars which were heavier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran had influenced El@@ end and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remembered singing in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanging nylon in front of the open window , lest we do not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ ks left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ ks homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food in need of requirements .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers in Italy . however , it &apos;s true that the conditions that apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the Human Rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . there were impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an acceptance centre if they have officially adopted a request for asylum - which may draw for months after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then there are people who have no money for accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his inno@@ cence in life helped A@@ shar@@ ks to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af raised his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; after Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles .
according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , several of Afghan companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised by Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ resses and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Padua as well as behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic business and the retail and aim to get back to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ ks with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my land and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ ks also de@@ vis@@ es plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , which can sell people packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can sell their appointment on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
development as a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ ks has made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : bills of Egypt enable the order of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan since more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament checks out a bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in government authorities .
users would have to use the social networks to use the social networks , within six months after the successful legislative decision on the website of the authority as well as to register their identification number .
whoever missed this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently deb@@ ated to the D.@@ ative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy was filed , in which har@@ der pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high priest would be introduced .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President and the public facilities would already be stra@@ f@@ able . however , under the bill , such experts would have been en@@ chan@@ ted with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts at Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean to three years in prison for the convicted def@@ endants .
in addition , this would have under@@ score a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and meetings of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers while demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who used violence against the military coup d Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 members who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in jail at a court of court .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management of human rights groups had failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the court in the court .
Sha@@ w@@ cane threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ lamp load of e.g. weapons of arms , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the sentence of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also were arrested during pre @-@ mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ian activists interro@@ gated documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated to a conf@@ essed action plan . the plan is supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly adopted a controversial bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption , if this would be un@@ lawful money back .
this document released on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sets a light to look like the pre@@ sidi@@ ous plans for the support of the draft law .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the dis@@ closure of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press line , which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protection of their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case .
will China for@@ ge the users of social media to present their ID card ?
according to the new rules of the Office Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media in China require a permit before they write to news in social media .
it is also stated in the prescri@@ ption that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts agree that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments can be achieved through the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese network citizens proposed to carry out these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we see you in &quot; White Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat is to sign up in the state government as an &quot; organizer of the information pro@@ liferation . &quot;
this name is part of a Act of 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law allows the government to make use of the government responsible for removing contents and to force them on request for execution of user data .
these websites include websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ ar@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court features lock Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court had the lock Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English articles , the information , Turkey under@@ stands the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to the site because it works to &quot; a source of information that works with groups to attack a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is therefore , besides , among others China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop w@@ rest@@ ling
following this week , the Great Britain is located in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with respect to increased surveillance products that would require the internet service provider to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install the Backdoor programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
however , the government cons@@ ulted the telecommunications company and intelligence services concerning the incident , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , consultations still runs until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
