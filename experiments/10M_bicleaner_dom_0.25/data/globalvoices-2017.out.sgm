<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors, and run his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a poor profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter who had taken place with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student, the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to continue his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free according to Method Man, "I was it," it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had my admiration for the USA only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, its diversity is so inviting, that you can always be the one who you are and it's easy acceptance in a community of equally healthy people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with its narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his mind behind the mountain, as you say so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "nevertheless, people have voted for his statements and tuned to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won by the Republican elections, was the highest number ever recorded by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigma person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not know Trump and his voters in line with people who met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, trumps worldview did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced for the environment for her life long, and her husband Dave, my host family, who actually treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues, to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser was helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embored my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump transferred his way to the nominated republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the equivalent of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The meditation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either giving his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the trump-electors as a passists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people, said one of my friends, is that which led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates a ability to understand those who deal with a different way and thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this electorate, of whom most of the white have voted for Trump, because they would like to re-win control of a country that has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they may say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">But one can't forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with respect to those who look like it differently.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm).: as much as "rejection of the White against all other Ethics;" vocabulary from white in recognition to the White and whiplash, what is so much like Schleudertrauma), as did the big Van Jones, exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always have always like America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history is as he himself says, nowhere else in the world were possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise to and say: to hell with manifold, religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the Ruder, say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all these things I have to think to Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humphun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roar the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if any man, who is not like you, has a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God be thanked, Mr. Trump, is this not your American." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now this is Trumps country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people, like Mr. Khan, could not find no more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children leave their love to music not by rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music that is played at both sites, not only the life of the children, but also has a close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large landfill, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby preColombian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments, has an opportunity to overcome them in the surrounding of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the commune of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and bonds.</seg>
<seg id="77">But it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn the day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically above the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments which are produced from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with repeated instruments that consist of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled card started under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez is recalled by Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local biologist and musical teachers of the children of Cateura at the start time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same spot the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a Favista something which he had never seen before: a violin had produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of reprepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonical refuse garbage) records the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something nice.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played even before Pope Francis in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work will succeed Illegal Fisheries</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focused on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship was already held in Liberia waters of illegal fishing, before it sought to wait for other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were dispersed behind this and slightly sloped, a decree of those kind to be welcomed to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles will quickly move against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fisheries permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries which you simply refused to remembers" "", "a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authorities. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't successful to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, for pillaging the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and conservation, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by NRO stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries next to Somalia and Madagascar, which then had driven out the Premier of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are conspinned and working together. they share information and stand against illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending. this project gives FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, so because it is extremely difficult to make it extremely difficult. therefore illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate abuse of existing laws, which are to be protected by means of certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions of illegal fishing, the actions were replaced by bureaucratic hurdle, and through the snail-contempo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions nowadays occur in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There can be exchanged to the individual countries, such as lists of existing licenses, news to suspicious activities or details that could be noticed or experienced during a port spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive to move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas. also, so suspicious drivers will discover - such that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the ships involved in a fisheries, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have been a criminal offender.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information that the ships can not sell its cargo. and that they could even be forced to be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that deals with the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $20 million in lost sales, representing eight members of the HISH-i network each year, because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish species, which attracts the region's commercial catch from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices include actions, like the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifying fantasy species, the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation, and make the weaknesses of a failed-organized control system." "" "says Long." "" "it could not pass a ship illegally and a country could say 'You are not able to run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale hole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks, distributed to the fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and has found dead ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizational crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to make suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed continuously, helps to send the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fisherman use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and to hide their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Music analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also offers fishing information and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch to an example of their automated identification systems, where they can't be hired by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">So Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find a criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of it, who does what is doing - that is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and collect their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at the global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to meet the global system tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities not only detective crime, but also refresh them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously exploited without any license and had hardly to have consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i include a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since then fishing boats are selling more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 led the inspectors, found the inspectors there on board grids, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we have been subject to study project several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There will be six countries joined in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" With safety, the aim is to leave even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member of Somalia could report his first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the take of action against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="197">This is an adaptive version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was compelled by his father, the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano has now said within the context of the large La Perla Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were committed as crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the guarantor to carry the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He retained the family secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that it was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you do not notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not know that my father was a thief, Folder and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarerieofficials. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of State terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 became Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities, who had experienced as a boy in the course of years, and who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you pre scourged you with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they lead you not one day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The shortcut ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revoluckario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would become secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university graduates, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, Propagandamaterial, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'Where do the prisoners become tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he waited me to wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the car, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a blanket parked parcel and told me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clumps of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There, the prisoners become tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I go in and saw a Liege to be tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable. the other end was fixed to the body of the person who lay it up there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me for the third time, he brought me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the captives were emitted with handcuffs and were bound up.</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were sitting down with the face - all were at hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="257">I know this because my father told you at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Apart from La Cuadra, there were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck there a man there and killed him.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here were changed their names and were assigned to them as part of the process of deformation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they had survived the torture, the detainees were cast into the cuadra until the order from above came to be transferred.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a fellow in this crime. I said, no problem, they can put my burden to me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driver's license, last month of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word (coaguntensha), which means that "older drivers" means worse - maybe even with malicious backgroundbreaking & # 8212; as "fearful drivers" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads at the entrance and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, divided in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos, who was also aware of the local time for the local time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to that an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a insult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes' said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was first removed. (German: "fearful drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, although the grammatical does not have the correct name "Elder" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto prefecture debt replicated for the translation errors. furthermore, she stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had not been reviewed by translator and that the translation was not tested on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"I'm sorry that older people felt through inadequate correction (translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News continued in detail with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was refusing as an appropriate description of elderly drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents in the country.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by the elderly in 2005, representing a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens stood 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This makes her share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of deaths caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The name-mentioned reportage in the published version of article Comments on the Light which show that preliminary parts are some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="369">- "" "" "" "-" "" "isn't it wrong, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language, something that is in the case of native speakers. generally, the conviction that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Such a French native language should be translated from English to French in English - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language that could justify translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for the transfer, reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers that could learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have any foreign employees, have translations made company internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad their language skills.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The promised and traverse propositions which can arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique is not yet able to replace any human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formugs in Japan, including those who decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or not understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless. but by great companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also contributed to the recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by oppositively groups who contradict the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>

<seg id="405">Earlier replica of the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that local Internet providers can use DNA. it is a technique that answer the DNS server questions of certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), which is processed by Global Voices Latin America and re-released.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her studies at the university, she returned to the home again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">Those who have become something has become, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a large family with little money over its underage son or her underage daughter to another family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned above, that the children must pay for countless days of house work, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not raise up in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This was called Criadazgo practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected a witness, researched and refused.</seg>
<seg id="428">They attempted to name the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated by the Criaditas, guarantees a standstill in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is one part of the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their training, improve their position in society and can make something out of itself. "</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who participates the girl with faith and justify their exploitation by faith, that someone would give someone a chance that would not be an apprenticeship, otherwise it might even be hungry.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n arrived in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of fierce battles. shortly afterwards, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former army of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer during the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They felt that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply involved in the parakayan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay are Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, amongst which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want the TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to trial, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n may be landmark, if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo is coming to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour force, they are also insulated by other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farah lived in which her father worked, bankrupt, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work and began to work on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time so that you still remained for learning too.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, purified the refrigerator, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and the infected ground down the floor.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary committee recently approved a draft bill to "the regulators of usage and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When he is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt in a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would be set up for use in order to use citizens, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users need to register within the site of the site with their proper name and number of personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as "any application that will run on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is being enforced, since the draft cannot be imposed on how the Egyptian authorities are able to impose users who do not register with regard to the fact that the Egyptian government currently is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">RiyadAbdul Sattar, Parliament and member of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and users received a user name and a password to come through the firewall that blocked Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Senior Research Department") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights," told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly advise the technical capacities and the understanding of any neither agency in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion it is possible to imagine that as they are violent in physical and private spaces that could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that they will apply a powerful monitoring system to apply citizens to monitor a permit or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to take it a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically no way realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the Legislative Assembly and the constitutional committees before being debated in the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military reasoning in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating Narrative is present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "like Raza in the video shows," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining prey in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to watch a Persian Leopards in the open space is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video is that they have a recording of a great cat in the camera that leaves Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the North-East Japan have been affected by the life of those who were affected by the "Trifold disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a certain prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwns were forced evacuated, because the tsunami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had experienced a nuclear accident, but already about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shown at the local point of view which advances in progress for six years in order to re-build the life of local-resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding process and poll results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare homes (pool, child, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures. 80 percent of the planned spare homes were finished here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima happened 70 percent of its final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">While still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by the command, evacuated by the command of residence (which was evacuated by us) in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the three-way disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of Fukushima still evacuated from Fukushima still in emergencies, whereas Miyagi had been more successful in emergencies. more than 75 percent of the evacuated submercies were moved into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">"" "" "" "the stand of works and daily life in the three affected prefectures." ""</seg>
<seg id="560">How the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung could find out, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by evil, will open its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now come into operation in Fukushima, only 30 per cent of fishing ports have recovered their operations.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, bred in the three prefectures agricultural land large-area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroys farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable land of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear fire zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has continuously recovered again, but Fukushima remains unbeaten yet.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, there can be only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their lives.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared on the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated population. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also, as their empathering has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction by the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung declares:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey resulted in 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed expect that still not enough in catastrophes have been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who need to evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima was a witness of the worst, catastrophy, atomic accident, who had to experience Japan in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state, more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated areas are more than 50 years old. they must be recalled in proper destination, because the efforts made for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If one met people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences were initially larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while you often know that one more connects more than it at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they challenge our processes, and recall our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely to these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal topics that often get less attention when you earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember to a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Camarasa talks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world.

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the German university of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several factions.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated this Saturday in this Saturday and have translated him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which quickly spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the face of the police officers is also recognizable with a headstock attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After incident the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the incident recorded by the active service.</seg>

<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political power: here the activist Guilherme was murdered in secondary schools. here, the Military Police of a WhatsApp Group had been sabotaged, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen, who struck him with a blows on the face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police supergrips</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil on the last Friday of brutal police forces against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="617">Member Flavio Serafini, social and peace party (PSOL), the police implored the police on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media protector missed the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window of windows.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a crushed glass windows to illustrate with a photo of their titles.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a set-driven bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic cause, more about a broken window, than the protests of thousands, who serve the defense of a special thing to report.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognise if one is stricken against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" receives an absurd, disproportionate significance and the typical violent actions of the military police will be denied by headlines with the title "demonstrators on the frontational course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Forgotten Villages to Cuba from Entindustrates in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">The introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Municipality Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - Spanish ZuckermÃ¼hle - well, regardless of that there are no significant sugar harvested on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were driven into the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the narration, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute every day to the factories, which still should be grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo flower, who stands up every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugarcane industry can not sleep his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the eastern region of the sugar cane mill, which are back into operation after a long time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly heard that in MaÃ±alich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarcane industry resistance already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, the inefficiency, the bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for some decades ago, but the poor harvest is no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar tube industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stiff from the congregation saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the train crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price went back around a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the prize has to remain unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Landscapes" from the OECD and FAO, the Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar-export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro became the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugarcane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, about the closure of the factory, is the word which he is repeated most repeatedly, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, it formed a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first quarter of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">"" "" "" "it was officially stated that documents only concerning the parts that would be removed, addressing the address and the date." ""</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulf Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could sing every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there passed the responsibility and the letters were increasingly more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the lapping factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money in operation for the production of sugar cane factories."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, where construction it helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">Each part, which he removed, dismantled him one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important burners were wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases no alternatives were found for employment and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present people saw that it was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory ended, or better, when they began to listen to them, they also heard on paved road, this disadvantageous way for other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search out other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were too spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without any future prospects, many young people left the region once again.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014, workshop mobile sound studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop - group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop reveals that the young participants in discussions topics such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever they are in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells example the story of Highway 16, also called Highway from tears, "on the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't have to worry about the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation are recorded, the refrain will be sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a Stanza in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Stanza is available in the transcription, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to walk back my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day that you will get to our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">"" "" "" "but I think that we will rise for a day." ""</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and advance to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus they can do so what they are the Creator</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking in Mexico, the losses and those killed regularly are in statistics. however, these are not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The submission on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of Sinaloa-Kartells, complained the stories of the victims of conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident is hardly someone looking for the sadness or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each corks, behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never cure cancer.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking,") and stories of people are telling the victims of human persecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project this way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime doesn't only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is a lot of profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug hands and all congregations therefore need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear of Life") tells us exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father and two brothers and two of their nephew on one single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priest:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have made to go and go to the graves after the people who we loved to seek." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I'm now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>

<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she will not pay them out because that a death certificate ask.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state of state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from lesbians and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal polÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero, in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and Sensational journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I get over every day to newspaper kiosks and see the titelssides with pictures, which can actually come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who was wideprived or sad. it works, like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal or considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old Cousin think that he is great. and it is also not normal that people songs about the "heroic" of offenders when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is, as they would have lost to those who lost someone and those who have fear them something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to bloom numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village might be justified" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to talk to the fact that they spared from such tragedies if they don't touch themselves and still are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of pressing in the city district." in this she describes how armed criminal month was plundered for month money from their business until they had destroyed only the business, but also her family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost, and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain is never going away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because you don't know when they lead you or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these awful days, if there would be my deepest feelings feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of the designated Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he throws questions on how: who cares for the child of a mixed wife and man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his old age, whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he himself had to bite itself how to make an egg cooking, potatoes, tortillas warm, and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for one boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he had only a few blocks from his home, the bloody surrounds of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a sojourneying car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a violence through the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder by public security and government of government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor numbered 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8.5 murder per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of always new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" in 2015, Animal PolÃ­tico established the data journalism project, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in one moment, in which it comes to withdraw a rumor or fake a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years since something is dipped in the first time? content in social media, whether it or untrue, tends to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to illustrate, tragedies, which was actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about our desire to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa was neglected in the second largest country for years and devastated. the streets in the region became a dangerous path with impact holes which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Carrying out the tank car to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">By government representatives described a fireball, the dozen houses, including a cinemas near, which was full of people who illustrate the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Fold the houses distressed and stolen tents in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to incomprehension.</seg>
<seg id="831">An image with the title "This is Nigeria". from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the occurrences form the gray scenes of that day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of it.</seg>
<seg id="833">It displays rows of stolen body which rolls on the ground while they are looking forward to seeing it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was removed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but probably not related to the related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 militants of the Boko Haram attacked the indigenous towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of horrors before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and served in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count corpses," said one resident to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismantled, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite imagery, the follow-up time could be presented.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and trying to win the Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here, the image of the DR Congo appeared again, as it appears as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this miserable use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of malicious descriptions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was brought to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example will fold the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The pliers came also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who flee hits, rape and some deaths, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya, posters like the following on which these descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news, which said in 2012, the president of Myanmars Thein being said that monk and politician participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other News organizations that referred to AFP as their source, had also believed Thein his testimony, but did not have the image taken from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false declarations</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false declarations date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "retraced picture search" you can see how far beyond borders cannot exceed limits.</seg>
<seg id="862">An overturned image search with the search engine TinEye has shown 344 images under 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017) 344 images that are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="934">Sugary these mood of malice and falsehood that actual atrocities are intrue and do it seem to thaw the real grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images was already debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible pictures reader and spectator will take the ability to empt empathy (such as this study, who should teach, as violent media have to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot concerning violent representations in the media media, fact that they are indispensable for the present news coverage.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) endeavoured to offer voice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these indisputable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudi Saudi) and others that are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish soviesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard-neccesses every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, so a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were already gathered for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu sales book, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - for your parents in recognition of how to make you strive for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsel language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth, which you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In his own words in his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They decent other cultures, unveil other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the guillists on this site or show more of this "irreplaceable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an option to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices told a short story of Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and obsolete the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS had already been held since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world may be avoided if we create cities, accept diversity - secure rooms where residents do not forget to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "Listen to understand" "" "to understand," "" "listen to these events instead of" "" "listen to feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, histories form their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storycounter, their devotion and their representation is that the audiences can be attached to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and Emotions, than be the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the history of Rassidatou Konate takes also the opportunity to clarify their land and customs of narration.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the babel of the bunnies and the Pasha in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>

<seg id="1150">You have heard it!</seg>

<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is free here, contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to be structured as moves for free knowledge and what the true cost are to, with which this is connected to.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers, have worked on side to view over the nebula who gives our newsfeeds to create something sense out of our different experiences.</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of Adra in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no more information about current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice dedicated to his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, action and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>

<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temptations of extreme poverty?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been held in prison by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons as the Insider of the Assad government and presented it by an alleged death sentence against her husband on 12 November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his position and condition remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a key role in making access to the Internet and to expand public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist, and currently overly of the director of New Palmyra, a project, the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of bass-cultural prototypes were predictive as the work which he started building with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilians and there are greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not yet known that ten years after he began to work with this work, the IS would have it all of it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology, and maintenance has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Portel could not shut down this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bassist me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English good.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other inward taught English to write and to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other indoors, as they still use computers, at least in theory, without the fact that they actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption, the director of corruption returned to the post office after the release of corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosquitans reacted to a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace, after half of his sentence in the workplace, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the development of Digeoino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 with four other defendants due to failure of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza, between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In 2016, Cambaza was released for a good lead and immediately requested his re-setting into the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, relocating his old post, since the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), a local institution which sets itself for public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to set up the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and even a restep in relation to the efforts of our legal systems, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of it is that the company should have developed a disciplining of disciplines against the tradespeople.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, not adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambiance of social media, also rejects this behaviour as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would have been an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them did eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has joined the company to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm the damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Thus it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambians and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he replied it, I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already revived so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to the state and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only operated himself in the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was using the state as handele had to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man, the preloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel that a thief was in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-cutting, and - Incidentally, Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious human being is to be able to sell his own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being decriminally. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also disappointing:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and he sat for 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their Posts from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussing about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people ostinarian background or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or around the world. (in burmesan writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given an extremely valuable banknote.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists than hate Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat human language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may today usually be associated with racism, but the word at itself does not call the speech of hate.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed in doubt because of his use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burian words with fundamental different meanings, which have the same letter of letters such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(spage),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they could eat, as he could pains his back pain by making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set of ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the Questioning (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that she is going to reduce the language of Hassal nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic before it deletes all the postings suspected to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It will automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead, the post is carefully to analyze and control it by check them in the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spill age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-day nationalists, the Hassi is spreading, preserving a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">It is now time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "during the promotion, a strong signal may be sent to them that hate speech, may not keep the efficiency of this strategy long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often have a cat- and mouse game where users can simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the scenic word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his postal as he just wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "" "" "ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and me became the liken, post and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the Post" "" "Facebook Community standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of Posts from people who have no negative views or who are simply trying to show their opinion against Hassals of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with Hassing:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believed that Facebook could have more to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a well-wanted intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also appears as if they started without any local context or technical support and banned as words as "chair" or "pea curry".</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they did not have bugs, they didn't tried to read the forgery.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they have only something more respect for the 15 million benefits that had a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care for much fun under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than to take it seriously, users have fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their Posts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which did not abstain from hate language, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the pea curry and watching a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out if Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious foundations, social networks have used to have increased their voices and their influence.</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure in Hasselt of Hassans on his Burmese sites, criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just using the word 'Kalar', it would have been better, in context rather than on Code of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's Parliament unanimously decided unanimously to provide this practice, so that the married age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage there were some members of Hinduistic and muscular religious communities on practice, and in May 2016 there came to a great public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group of members of the various religious groups of the country, did not bring to the state that the state should not be convened, as it was, at age not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was impaired by the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner to the UN's Convention on Climate Change, and is defined by minors under 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 showed that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements which constrive to abolish legislation to the children, followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they are waiting for this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, all were not smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children, they should have darn to worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was sorcerated for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and some some doubts came to agree whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contributed to the House of Representatives, so where a simple majority would be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now, only the president of the country must vote and proclaim the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators on Facebook has announced a Status update which has once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children's toe was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After previously decided in the Senate, the draft must now be made to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been finally changed to children's birthday.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was appointed Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It used too much time and unnecessary tingle that spared the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's escape is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel's Jackson was, there was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was delighted that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouses has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of the spouse was decided today, 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">At the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and 35 were present at the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the best-known Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months Maharaj announced his intention to be prosecuted, the law should be adopted, and it seems to be dissolving his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, it was quite legitimately if Maharaj would like to proceed against the law, most social media users would like to approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell tends to:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion so general that we would have to use the state in our bedrooms, simply target that the state, our daughters before it protects, that they may be misused by large, hard-mocked husbands, who may be misused, "would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, if it is now too an accusation against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's children are legally legal or even the norm, although there are laws that they must say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012 at the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Day is clarified as important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques have been accustomed to use conversion tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most unusual Wikipedia users are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey closed articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has held regular blockades of the Internet since 2007, after the internet act has been adopted (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive cycensorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several Mirror pages (pages which reflect the content from Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus calculator calculator), which is based on the system of domain name and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is irrevocable despite the general prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (on the blocking of Wikipedia) we put everything to place Snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if you can't reach the www.wikipeoporg website itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also showed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only for screenshots and not live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklope.org, a Mirror from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hoursed similar Mirror to hosten when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and collaborators with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy server, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One is attacking to another URL that is not the original. that's what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents from Wikipedia itself, when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were sick with poorable motifs and dreaded colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera with yourself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar relied on the international stage at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its native town directly next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that turn attention to nepic wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook on Facebook, as it helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game of wild!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just stayed at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to knee pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar is striving of cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepalese Nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not as veneer as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood far from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be annoyed from the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately puts up immediately, we look forward to and he starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the support of Nepals Nature and Wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He was waiting for 22 days, and still lived in a tent in order to take up at Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days it took up until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content-sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women's greatest care to discuss the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a tonomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chabisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they should respect her husband's husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should consider the standard, this practice is alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Oja by a real court and redirected by her family and the village community after she had spoken a secret relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of her wives also did not act as a name, is also common among men. however, they are far better to worry if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthcare professionals and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main event theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, in which they discuss the fine arts of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian countries, is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is located in the exploitation of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas worked for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of internships, such as the pedigreate to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they also made them to the ambassadors of murders at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, showing the Rohini show in their discussion group, did women who do not call her husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject, because it wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of her husbands do not talk loud, is a brilliance to keep it guilty and never put into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Raw material mean:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't think this will be regarded as a female, as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep roots that we have never made this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the beginning, Rohini wanted to have previously named Rohini, who has never called his husband to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Raw ini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me and said I should name him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion lub with this self confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoying, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, is that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought the name of her husband on her lips," says Rohini Pai from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a century-old tradition, in which women married women's names never to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Raw ini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise only occurred before itself; another decided to leave the whole frustrations against him and his family by taking it off.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her face was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalince about it, with an ancient bread, the women decided that they actually would actually try to call her husbands during the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they had in the head: his wife did not stop to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was afraid, she was afraid, saying that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini meant I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a group of participants was less understandable and the situation was carried out in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Raw ini reports how women tries to stop other practices, such as the carving of interest of interest on the forehead, which shows the spicatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the nucleus red point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I stopped to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped doing so, but mine, they are now in a better position, but to be able to bear him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip at every discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women make sure that what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cake and cheeks and cheeks and talking about things about whom they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Raw ini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have also been talking about some things, for example how our identities have been linked to our husbands, never as honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things to say loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have driven us about the concept of honor and connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have applied only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is the okay, but some wanted to wear a salta-curta, a large shirt about a pants; they have not grown.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of the own wardrobe, the Moral connected with the Saris and much more, Muggelding Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question whether in the five months since their first discussion lub has already changed something, Rohini confirmed that things get slowly into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but they left again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are wearing Zinnoberred at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - as the feiling for more motion freedom or the own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, it is deliberately to sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is each of us to change that something is changing.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when any woman enters the club home and other people concerning it, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made until recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has taken attention to the international community that had announced his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (Staatsendometry), after having responded to the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that requested the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case as "an internal issue," and a speaker told it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still obtains calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, allowing him to allow treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, other countries are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">One speaker rejected it, however, to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable the treatment of liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Minister of Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Bringing have refused to answer questions about Lius liberation.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was moving into Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu although the Norwegian government announced that this would eventually do nothing with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to return to China, as the exports have been completely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the message that Liu was serious, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release, and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, it was not able to increase its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she took in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we are expecting to raise all limitations of Mr Lius wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">You should meet and receive all visits, which they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad shared that the Americans said to him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, as long as it was possible to help him in its genesis. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">An spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message to the Chinese authorities to allow the Chinese authorities to allow not only Liu to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The petition of the US Embassy drew a wailing response from China to itself, with the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to be united and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom like travel talks and access to the medical care of its choice, which they have received according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senate Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally free.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to allow Nobel Peace Laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally free to proceed to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">"" "the German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hoping that Liu" "" "all the medical support is that he needs" "" "and that a" "" "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the News Agency (Reuters) that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could be surpassed the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China asked to provide an appropriate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to leave his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP that Liu Ms, Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in hospital, and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to protect his international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and allow to release their rights to the exercise of this rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry asked China to allow for humanitarian reasons on June 29 to open for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be seized to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he needs, independent where, whether they want to contact his wife and his family.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news broadcaster France Info reported that the French government would be welcomed Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was known that France will not find further information if France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Festspiele in Taiwan called for China on 27 June, allowing Liu to allow a greater tolerance compared to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called for China to allow the intellectual Liu to treat himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself very careful in a statement on June 28 at Liu, and gave that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was strictly punished, would have led to a harmonious, more stable, and wealthy China, what would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and law-nationalities in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question is stupid that Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shangugam, Singapore was to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark was triggered in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the International Women's Association of the State of New York, the Minister knew that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to rotate the logic, to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, we can say that we were finally no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight prior to the responsibilities, a compulsory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanguamalgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what he appeared to be untrue.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the subject point of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritarian machestants appears to be the previous Democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final result, in the final week of Shanguamalgam, answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiative, our political system is really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions confessed it with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shancourgam to clear his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a land, but it is a city, so that the country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our werter K Shancourageous would take it to clear this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he has published his comments concerning the critics that you should start to read the full address of the conference, so that you could even understand the context of the statements of Shangugam, according to that Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the heading.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "", "he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so unimportant, even if we are looking for free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He distributed Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party of decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "No land," "" "he did not exist in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment over Shanguamalgam working as leader of a firm-growing generation, such as such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that expects me - be I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shancourgam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have no doubt and I'm not sure that he really believes that he is really associated with what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disassembled the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanguamalgam committed a mistake "or was it a Freudger spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cable, the statements of Mr. Shanggam are serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do people do more than their military service, do not defend their own city, but not their land?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The journal Journey of a Decade to the reference, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have been offended with many people...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country, especially" "", "but this is not really correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his Editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continued series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world revealed and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question, which is placed in Japan on the most, is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry for me." "" "I'm coming from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation, the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his talk partners by providing personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my claret it usually follows the standard reply: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many canadians may cook from Wut, if they are kept for Americans, but does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always borne small maple leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons in us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages are legal in Canada already since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "we obviously say very often" "" "sorry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies to ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admired a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would account for me, if one would replace me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, as "nice" to be referred to as "nice" to be to be spawless, but tragically important figure Ned Flanders of "The Simpsons" (which has a private Canadian double gÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really was a nation of people such as Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward in fact, but the actual problem exists that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which one can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, to be unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good, if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, remote from the things that around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire is free and to be one of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what can be called" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool politeness." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm-hearty, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just 'nice.' our prime minister has left Canada just right.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him who makes himself his girlfriend.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists informed the public.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial about how it is able to keep by the country under the Junta domination.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that have been committed to Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "refers to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which was given to the Commander in Chief of the army's absolute decision on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal against, whose vage and unclear regulations are often used by authorities to suspend activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, the online content monitors and persons accused of having accused of having denied the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict marriage against "Lese Majeste" (Majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, a war was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase, their decision is buying U-boats, although security experts complained that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black vans before being thrown into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they have caused the confusion of "confusion" in society and have long adherence to the monarchy, they should keep the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa" hosts migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border from Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 at the website of our Partners PRI.org and will be published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapestula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is guided by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a little woman with a cork-pink brilliantly and gold colored earring in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and has grown up there. yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, brushed walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance hall there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez also tells you people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject our own.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurache) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it is too her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston, to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States to make a normal stop in South America and then go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other wayfarers of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans are often traveling the track and that Africans were already talking to WhatsApp by Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his departure, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest for Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the required money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our mother and we never let it go," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez told that her guests will send their often text messages when they went to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that your Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know far beyond Africa, but their guests have brought to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps here very well known, but she is not the only sparks hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul de sawasse to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family visited migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the robes will be sold to many African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get an appropriate price, and he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experienced.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years since he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through tapestula comes from central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to kill him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a sole, has its roof offered to him.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the course, travelers enjoy quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of them that have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she loves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of their daughter with African hairdressers that you have made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya's fueron," repeats them every time. "they are already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on its cellphones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, built-in-end.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China are forced to install a spyware on its mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the City of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it refers to the district government called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the release of communication, the app "Connect" to obtain access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kills the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification made by the police, the app can determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic web pages, by online fraud, trojans and Phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" remote players or even hackers could be manipulating or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements concerning digital censorship in China mostly concentrated on the experience of users in major cities in the East and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures, as well as routinemate Internet downstream operations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The news based on Twitter based media outlet "Images from Mainland China" (pool-hematched), which was censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where the policemen then checked the residents, if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are interested in a checkpoint with one device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity due to the rest of the awakening technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (built-in-course) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift a Windows operating system to receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and cellphones in Xinjiang will become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the city council counseling to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government offices, authorities and the party associations, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instruction of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August, their "personal ID cards, cellphones, external drives, portable hard drives, laptops and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" and they violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million people, and gives them penalties for a full range of other verses, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political notifications.</seg>

<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has found in a list of feelings and press down, which allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when the reality brings you back and you looked behind the scenes - beyond the actors, the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters in beings from meat and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt dissolves in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth is on the axis of the storm. it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls, who have built your parents here, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have not arrested me and arrested my father three times, but that was not enough for me to form "my lesson," as the Chief of the Security Council it formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He put his power over us in proof, that even the simplest concepts that we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn out during a peaceful protests like the darnel in the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to play the town the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" -cry.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the city district is coveted, but my own not.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, rain-free, at the wrong time, even if I did not meet any high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their compliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night, things were a little calming after the power supply stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice by the silence.</seg>

<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet at the military safety building."</seg>

<seg id="2068">Your Henker enjoys a pleasure in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure of pleasure, you cannot measure you with him, and you can't return your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry fell not enough, so they exchangers the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked for earlier times as a garbage collector, or whether it was one of the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four wires in one another to present us from their sight, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them changed, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my soul in my body - and my voice is why I stopped to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling and did not take a pleasure in mind, so it was the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through all the body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-nude body, that was outstretched out on the ground, was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back there.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrifying hours he decided that he had to fulfill his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed away, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "the door opens and the morning light fills the room" "" ".Raus with you, Arschficers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBT + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib scores the majority of his time inside; let him go to his computer, and again to his couch again.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But of course you can rely on, a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips can be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib is a passionate active role that the conservative majority has been turned over against gender, sexuality and expression of expression through art and rapeside.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often continues with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poems, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these subjects are not only found in his home town in Amman, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria until all to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits, and he can feel according to their own statement with people who have among the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not open it frankly, he turns against the U.S. foreign policy a special dissolution.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in warfare, anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian Gebrance of the second generation" - so he himself describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life," stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think I am a man, while he floats in water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, she has a cup of coffee in a sensuing hot Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the strokes speak warm coffee and the scarf of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it's easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan it was to drink in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordi had canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees that support the Islamic State's Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontifier Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN says that the concert was cancelled "because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism, who poses the unproven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to be decided "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply sessed Rhetorik, but actually a clearly-crystalline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the fact that in Hdaibs's work clearly stated.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib's traditional lineage in her body, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vodeshelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidled unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan has increased the number of 'Honmormorde's "- the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to human Rights Watch the number of Honmorde in 2016 reached its zenith; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan became institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support adequate nature.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the Crime of Crime in 1954, women who are subjected to danger of inhumane violence are kept, "and for their release, often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, not to revert topics that are in its country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib suggests that his work is political, however, that he is his music, the full exponite accumulation on sexuality, freedom and expression, is not able to split politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I came into politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed', Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus again on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind market in which one can get in his words, "that can be what you want" - whether faith or unbelief, heterogencies or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan via the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBT + -individuals still heavily assaulted in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgramme Roya, in order to remember that his comments from the context was torn, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but he only became a working version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib calls open to the Arab LGBT + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals is not speaking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuer, a poets of the eighth century, which still remained in memory today because of its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: when Abu Nude, who later began to work on behalf of the calipers, in the eighth century, is open to homosexuality, why is Jordanian not this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government postponed attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive votes will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government members and members of the Teacher Association, with the reasoning, they would have been critical in favour of social media to be related to the problems that were deeply-related to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural changes in the next generation of the Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a steady and take advantage of Jordan. Mashrou'Leila is now ready for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - it is sure that these changes from day to day take place at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, were of abroad, an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreamed of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region may act with the aid of music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, spreading unitions and on artificial kind. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">So far as far as it is, Hdaib will resemble himself and therefore also afford resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting, which Aman belongs to Fellow as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually taken up in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory is that the car, the drums, and dancing for more than a thousand years have been delivered and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi in the knee.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a couple of great places, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (littl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I'm looking forward to the meguro Gajoen for a long time: two cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival offers the only true - and another stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was here and gave me the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The views of a 18-meter-high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were so important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from criminality and encourage a legitimate profession like the Hairflow.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru was experienced - as many other middle and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, and thus also the unusual hairdressers of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers in the experienced hands of hairdressers that make these elaborate hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The exceptional demand for hairdressers, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts in each other to show everyone who can see the eccentric lilies, as you can see in the following video (other videos for current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to preserve their weapons in hairdressing arts, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated from this activity and the benefits of dozens of young people saw that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in front of the school year in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the congregation and the district which we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beiter "Liebesmessage to Guerrilla fighters," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet more important, people who feel out-out, affecting to accommodate liking?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the cartas por la Reconciliation (letters to reconciliation), the young people to do with guerrilla-fought letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (deutsch: revolutionary forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the president of Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombian, however, a long way is still a long way, until they can speak of a real reconciliation and of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla-soldier, who lived for many years in illegal warehouses, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out around the clock, and have to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now support them in their ranks and support it in a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian we were convinced that the young column were to join the integration process and to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to be welcomed them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's aim is to provide 6900 letters - one of the former guerrilla fighters who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love to write in the Valentine's Day of love letters, but those who want to do much needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He bought, he told, in this year he was able to share his love with people who needed in the most urgent consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan, letters full of hope and support for the former fighter of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and to create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse from a story of war to a common history of peace." they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogotica traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members did so, as they did before, to make the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters fully supported by people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between" said the student student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I was in one of the "CamCode" (a kind of cottage, in which the guerrillas live in), I saw a guerrilla, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomegranate was a deadly weapon for the sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "What are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful roll.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before my life has been written in my life, so I answer it. "then suddenly I cried out the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, so tired of all the years of faithful companions to be this calmer, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never had something different from life as war. the FARC was one of the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of famine. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now, I know that there is a company outside, that wait for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Now I have learned to cope with weapons until now.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Students and some of the FARC leaders came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">Students were all grown up as the war, and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the Leader of the FARC declared the history of organization, their ideals and gave insight into their beliefs about the peace process: "many years long have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to develop our society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this magnitude it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never found hearing, and to recognise that people who I have seen often as monsters and even hate, just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their lives and the environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, would hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - even those who have killed and have done so much harm to us, and can give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote an example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that after the disarmament of peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest their rights and to protest their rights (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the Defenders of Peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - themselves of all those who live from a country in war dream.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford to our post and sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months about persecution of pregnant men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which depends on a Damoklist on the local LGBT community, is not only made about the night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what happened in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBT legal situation in Chechnya before several months ago conquers the international headlines, after reports that the towing, torture and slaughter of queer men in the Republic of thematic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities that suspects suspicious men and arrested them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">As early as her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown, it became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, which was why they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chechens from gender equality, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she moved to the USA last time.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helpers at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who encountered in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her to help me, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his tshechnya friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can fix this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos taken from my documents through the whole WhatsApp took the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a couple of shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a manure: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back I felt anything in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on the shattery: "how long will you honor the family, you snugget?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awakened last grandage in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get together and began to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses you have been laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there stands still my male name; but the doctor arose and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his brush, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he found himself as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They call me, wrote to me - relatives, foreign, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family has been visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They found absurd claims: some said to me that I must prove it up by the roads; others wanted me that I had not changed my sex at Grozny's official television that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she laid a cord around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and already a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My people of human rights tested the numbering pictures - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how do you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give her name, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without record, without registration, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I raised the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in safety, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you are on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you standing in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, but this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">But some traditional Caucasian elements can still be found in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I can't overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always, that, as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I give I really effort to see how the person commemorate it out of their past - so remember my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who took one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan it was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That I mean, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood genuggets.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even pregnant men captured in these secret products?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me, there wouldn't be much too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no significant relatives or dropped from their relatives to set up the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should you be converted, they will show her body in television and claim to attack them any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people don't have disappeared, but specifically dipped, to radically alize them.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mistake or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone in this prison after her beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken into account when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not introduced as band members until now, so far there were no reports yet. however, we guess that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave with these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation which took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already familiar with Grozny when I was still alive - and I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to donate us to the "civilizations" but finally rejected us into the quarry.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had coloured lashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Department of Security of the Scharia never worked with me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We never were insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often say to children if they have fun with sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed you will be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never before hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period mean?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak in television over Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not on us per se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had previously trebled and laughed at once, he looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic steadily slimitated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the U.S. not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as a activists.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetreffs, collars, I buried her to the hospital and help them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't forget any Cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves, when I cut off the refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allover.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is just the same as Chechens who want to do with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans who have the Russians also have which Russians also have them; on all planets, there are they - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, therefore it is very pleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and live during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transidy of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a trusting.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">It is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I personally become so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I myself am.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn for an increase of suicide in the verpoveraged Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi retired on August 27, the despair situation of the Arab Ahraazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he shedding himself for his own help to come up the inability for his family, like Ahraazi-human rights groups, who want to work in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video on YouTube made the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerators were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only self-committed suicide in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists say that even more men could take this life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmadazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayam Falah Moussadawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have started.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter: there were all family fathers, who felt in due to persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to pursue their families to feed and secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in most of Iran's living Arab Ahwazi-community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population to contest their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and continued in 1925 his efforts to terminate ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">There are some of the largest oil and gas areas in Iran in the Ahwaz region, as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resource, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the indigenous population will get only little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to condemn the Ahraazi-Arabs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a wide range of demics built by the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demme have led only to destroy the devastation caused by dryness caused devastation and local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Irish director of Kooperative, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who completed a work, completed an elementary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... to destroy the Spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activists in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethical discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of years in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the processing phase:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions do not prefers Arabian workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be able to access to all sectors in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their livelihood from their home to Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their way and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, because even the Arabic name may not be tolerated on the workplace, because the speaking of Arabic language or the horse-Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which have to endure the Arab Ahwazi, the human rights activates alarm, before the situation become explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world wakes up and assumes that.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, so many women - especially white women who designate themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even consider well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be Feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still remain under stringent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later encounter a glaze blanket earlier or later in various areas of life an glaze blanket, and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>

<seg id="2447">And yet: if I have to talk to skin colour, on black cis women, on black Cis women, on black women from the Diaspora; if I remember what kind we have physically, secular and verbal abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing "their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing" to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexual violence an institutional form of rampant violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spears and women are exposed to a higher risk of developing domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all women, all men and all men each neither skin colour the same rights. on the other hand, I can't connect me as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refuses to take care of both gender as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, who had become violent partner who could have been violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship has passed some time and the police said, their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further wife Balbuena was reported due to mistreatment, also the academic advertisement of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew its ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Difficult to break the Devil's threat against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are not at all time, they generally do not receive support by the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also dependent on the men that they harassed. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit to be victims of violence to participate in the prosecution of criminal authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says MycelGonzÃ¡lez, the researcher for Genderinquire at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports which show not even the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Attorney General Attorney 9600 went for domestic violence. over 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>

<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women, women and physical abuse were said, 55% of women said of mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the parakayischen Women's Minister Ana Baiardi are actually shown only a few of these criminal offences. "on every woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 counts of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2509">When I read about it in earlier, I always thought that the only women have happened to subordinate, because they can be disastrous by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and several attacks during their two years relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to show that his behaviour was a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they did so long by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mistreacts had at least a certain contributor to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you"), which consists of women all in some way victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others on their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women serious.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner managed to convince her to convince her that she was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorian advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against their former partners, who developed into an unfair legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it was mainly for money, power and the influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguayments laws: good approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The mistreacts of mistreatment is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, provides great problems with the laws of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# FÃ¼rff).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law stipulates that Feminist to become a independent pendicate and harder how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature has changed in some point to win even the MPs for the law, they were afraid that the way for decriminalization of abortions are generally prohibited in Paraguay with up to five years in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to charge the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which have to bear the victims of violence even if it just want to restore and secure accommodation to the State.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature is not liable to sufficient financial funds for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part in human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink is to take place, that violence is no longer regarded as a little ones.</seg>
<seg id="2537">In view of these facts, he pleaded not guilty, and helps the perpetrators come out.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to make this long viewing until failure is no more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was passed to the parakayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. among other things, a passage has been cancelled, which called for domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes going apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "gender," "political power" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered great setbacks.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website has been closed due to a resolution of the information Secretary" on the website of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omanic authorities have closed the independent Arabian newspaper Azamn for their coverage about corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, remains in prison, where he served a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court and returned to court later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">In 1970, Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had deposed his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans' domination is characterized by the beating efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, the public freedoms, including press freedom, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, intimidated and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restricting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically a and hindered citizens, also activists, their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closure and the detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inception in 2007 (an absolute monarchy) until it was prohibited by authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, concluded that in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, an article entitled "High-ranking Parties to the Justice" was published. in this, there went corruption in judicial decisions and the mixing of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS drew the representative of Chief Editor Yousef Al-Haj that led to Al-Maamarine as Chief Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was concluded indefinitely after the information ministers had given the statement that "the publication and spreading of the newspaper on every way, including online, as of August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial in Masgrave took place the first trial in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj, both amongst others, were sentenced to misuse of the internet, "abuse of the internet" and "undermine of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found in addition to the violation of an audience of publication and slander was found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three years of adheres and fines in the amount of 3000 omic Rial (7800 US dollars), a one-year vocational prohibition against both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he could represent the use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger to public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a damages deposit of 5000 omic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set on 22 August 2016 and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court said Al-Abri in a hearing held on 26 December 2016, condemned Al-Haj sentenced to six months "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the remainder of his six-month prison sentence in Mascat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his 18-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also abolished the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court, Azamn, the newspaper sees itself to be suspended until attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Information Minister received a statement that was extended by three months with the closure of "Azamn".</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Information Minister personally signed another statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, confirming the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was injured.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercising of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closure of Azamn and the detention of the journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to an extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj remotely discharged and unconditionally free;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure with his permission.</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need on-run medical research, there are two reasons: a lack of medications and vaccines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa widely as elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, is the development of its own research capacity in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS Epidemic showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When Postdoc researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he worked on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambarian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of media relating to these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks to be private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambarian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it enough?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who go back or move here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special scientific education, starting at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research on space, healthcare (non transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the access to scientific expertise that reflect this challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "Open Source" seed producers worldwide change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solution for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been producing salads in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company has 114 sorts, such as the example, the first plant that has been grown and cultivated by NASA astronaut in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only affected by his own ingenuity and the question as many salads have been able to get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special Rotor or Thorton or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more, more of such patents have been registered in more plants such as cereal or cartels. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and atomic facts ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of millennia of old tradition, Morton requires more salads, but now it takes longer, because his work is increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is better than that, in a river, there would be a boulders, in order to get the gondolas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a breach of the growing tradition, "he says." I think that these patents will go to salads too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the Court, no one can breed no new salad-sorb because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to figure out those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also has been connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" rebreeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman salat in the "glasshouses" the station farmed and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as it would come from the IT range and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspiring from the motion for free "Open Source" software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and animals are not protected as a intellectual property and are therefore durable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, Ossi is called Ossi, US breeders could also commit that others can use the seed-free seed for them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to make shops and sell it. "open source" Breeders allow only to cross their seeds to cross it as their own varieties, and not immediately stop them - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant materials.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scissful prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little to use with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not to buy food products in the global farm industry, whose most recent examples are offered to farmers in the global agriculture industry, as it is said for example in farmers markets, it should also know that the way is bred to themselves, like that vegetables are bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition superiority without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other seeds still free to provide their seed in contrast to seed, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous mental intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted, unparalleled shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has worked in its doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all cartographs have been protected as a intellectual property, making it either not even more usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby brave that massaging large plants as wheat in even larger style are coated as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted attributes - from such a way through which their taste or their color improves up to such, because of them flourish in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patients on plant properties indicates that the available plant material for breeders with more patents decreases. genetic diversity is currently more than ever before, because the changing conditions are much worse than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four interbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the company has held the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property include other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varied innovations promote". "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method on the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is inhibited as innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton considers the different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, surely no innovations will be.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long for plants to be adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the fight would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton requires that genetic resources always have been a general public and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monocular incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers doing their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it's impossible to use it if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton considers the concept to be patented, plant features: "we are creating the characteristics not really self.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form themselves, and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who cultivate a variety, also breeding his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes on industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures are needed for which cultivation of herbicides are needed, breeding in his varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, the majority of smaller seed companies, also without having patents - either rests they or keep it too expensive and therefore not remunching or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders by the Avoid of plant patients innovatively: "it looks as if I was able to produce new, more potent as a company that is patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself, "says he." with a patent you will be protected for 20 years before competition, so it is easy to make it very nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India the centre for sustainable agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, supporting a "open-source" seed shops. the farmers work together with farmers, helping them to breeding new varieties to fulfill the specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "Open Source" seeds and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Emcol works on an "open-source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breaches differ from land to land, no one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. this means that they are allowed against the current practice of the European Patent Office, based on conventional crops.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, based on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards reorientation of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for" Open Source "" "" Program for "Open Source" "" "for" Open Source "" "," that the organization is currently providing a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" "" "for the scheduled next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database to seed seed and biodiversity worldwide, to publish the Seed map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essential - a combination of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represents a report that farmers must have the opportunity to improve seeds and improve seed policy, making it a stable supply with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods is mainly stuffed where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly ever played a role," "" "Luby." "" "we try now to clear the people even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">The Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government closed the website of the "Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network released a statement on Facebook where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The World Network for Human Rights Information Continuous despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution, which is never so difficult to track these goals, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome these goals, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome the blocking, and do not reprove to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news about the Huffington Post and Qatar-speaking network of Al Jazeera for the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights organisation of the shaft of the shaft rescements to the victims. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZOOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Next to ANHRI also exists in the blog of the columnists and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of Columbus and articles, which he has not on the access sites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog which he established to circumvent the census of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also is native to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protector and recorded a video like police physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly turning to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook-comment, Ziada expressed its counterpart through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blogs of the blogs may not be meaningless for the world, then it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is succeeded to convey the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blogs blogs, as well as every other web page that I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked Him, and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) the Egyptian authorities published 133 websites from May 24th to August 06. these are technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), amongst others orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE, also documented the distortion of providers by levering Internet ensorship and private surfers, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12th of June, we realized how the blocking of websites run by VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and to filtering the Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will also be sloped that the force decisions were taken behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using which they can proceed against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are struggling.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for Day, in Brazil, newspapers from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home of several postcard shows.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14-year-old shot at school" "" "Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered," "" "thieves pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air afee to Rio." ""</seg>

<seg id="2757">As Global Justice, Brazilian non-governmental organisation called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least take the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio popular newspaper "Extra" on August 16th, article "This is not normal," in which they announced, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world, like murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything that happens in Rio, will be published in the "War" "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to say: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to conclude that we did not close our eyes in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the Chief Editor of the Newspaper, declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a marruster in a country that doesn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video explains a journalist in the newspaper that according to the data of the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when he is distorted, can also be used to interrogate cruisers of the police, which is firmed and then asks questions to conceal.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "War" become more than they profit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in CecÃ­lia Oliveira. this is in their opinion according to justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult, responsible for the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown on the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff, lightenment and a historical and self-counterfeit detection of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">Initially, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP was actually protecting over relics and repression against the poor municipalities that should virtually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly below.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio draws war also serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state to use means and paths which are typical for a war. this is the intrusion into the territory of an "enemy" where a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and to the object for "collateral damages" and "miserable balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or, fact, fact that the inhabitants of Favelas will continue to continue in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At this time, Asharaf Barati was a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in Ghazni province, for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharks found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort. work was heavily and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then did he, what was left of his small wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing sacks with mortars which were heavier than he himself to earn his life.</seg>

<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharks left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharks homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food in need of requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers in Italy. however, it's true that the conditions that apply asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes the system "suffers under a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special recording centers. there were improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to an acceptance centre if they have officially adopted a request for asylum - which may draw for months after the registration of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who have no money for accommodation, either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocence in life helped Asharks to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf raised his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, several of Afghan companies, including tailor, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised by Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waitresses and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp in Padua as well as behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals are far beyond the Italian gastronomic business and the retail and aim to get back to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharks with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land and I can't live happy if I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharks also devises plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, which can sell people packaging and preservatives. "so they can sell their appointment on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Development as a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt but at the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bills of Egypt enable the order of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan since more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photograph of @ Cilina27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot, challenges, victories, and upcoming trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks out a bill, which stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to use the social networks to use the social networks, within six months after the successful legislative decision on the website of the authority as well as to register their identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Whoever missed this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently debated to the D.ative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and will be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another deputy was filed, in which harder penalties for the insult of the President or a high priest would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and the public facilities would already be strafable. however, under the bill, such experts would have been enchanted with prison and fines, legal experts at Tahrir Institute for Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean to three years in prison for the convicted defendants.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would have underscore a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and meetings of freedom has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who used violence against the military coup d Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 members who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in jail at a court of court.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison management of human rights groups had failed to bring the defendants from prison to the court in the court.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawcane threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headlamp load of e.g. weapons of arms, illegitimate assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke of two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage for pro-Morsi seat blockade at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentence of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly, who also were arrested during pre-mentioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunesian activists interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a confessed action plan. the plan is supported by the President of the Republic, according to the plan expressly adopted a controversial bill, the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if this would be unlawful money back.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document released on 21 April at Nawaat's website, sets a light to look like the presidious plans for the support of the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the disclosure of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian press line, which journalists secures the right to protection of their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China forge the users of social media to present their ID card?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Office Council of the People's Republic of China, social media in China require a permit before they write to news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the prescription that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts agree that the elimination of anonymous comments can be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is now unclear how the authorities apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese network citizens proposed to carry out these regulations only selectively in order to protect" "" "citizens" "" "and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Will we see you in "White Chat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat is to sign up in the state government as an "organizer of the information proliferation."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This name is part of a Act of 2014, thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services, which allows the "publication of information." the law allows the government to make use of the government responsible for removing contents and to force them on request for execution of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites like Vcontacts and Odnoarniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court features lock Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court had the lock Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to erase two English articles, the information, Turkey understands the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, maritime affairs and communication gave to the site because it works to "a source of information that works with groups to attack a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is therefore, besides, among others China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can not stop wrestling</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week, the Great Britain is located in the midst of a deliberate consultation with respect to increased surveillance products that would require the internet service provider to monitor communications in real-time and to install the Backdoor programs to decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">However, the government consulted the telecommunications company and intelligence services concerning the incident, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, consultations still runs until 19 May. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
