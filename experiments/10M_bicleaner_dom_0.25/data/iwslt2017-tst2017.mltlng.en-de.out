that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that N@@ SA &apos;s illegal teleph@@ ones have heard from Americans .
it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret operation in which the CIA delivered Iran &apos;s official designs for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , who did not know the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against R@@ isen and called him to name his alleged sources .
in this train it became the symbol for the design of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to occupy journalists .
according to the First Constitu@@ ency , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media are not able to protect this information and if they can not protect identity of the mud , which they give .
so when the government drew near R@@ isen , he did something what many cour@@ ageous rep@@ ortage came before him : he refused , and said he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , though they were without doubt that it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : during the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide in less .
instead of failure and R@@ isen , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without being compreh@@ ended , rel@@ ying his phone @-@ wise secret ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and band information , its credit card , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn the CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her job as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of being a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so , we put the press work on the game that shall be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has always expanded more possibilities to attract all .
but just as technology of the government permits to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ or@@ kers , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can get from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the subsequent , in the testimony .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen , his book , and it is much more saf@@ er than normal emails or telephone calls .
a such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet most famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
you can upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant News Agency has access .
so , the government may not cure more information secretly , and many of the information that would like it would be not available .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop new sp@@ ying technologies all over the world , all of which are to end@@ anger ourselves .
it is necessary to ensure that not only technology numbers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to put abuse . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the over abuse during the supply of soldiers would like to know and reported by over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals , the alarm to the f@@ aded water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ paper insi@@ der , which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data spot of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; This week , we were asked by news about a l@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will get an impression of how clients , banks and lawyers like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , such as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland prime minister has come back .
also , there are reports that a ban of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad station@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , with a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait , wait to wait for the next publication , and to expos@@ e to the next publication .
now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it seems that cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets under tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few people are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discus@@ sing and un@@ veil for ten years .
I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I place it always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ger .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really , which thing is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no major Americans so far that occurred in these revel@@ ations in this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who store their property in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a bit of data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed to handle school children to school children .
it allows you to re@@ boot especially vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behaviour that all concerns us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a secret investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister , the susp@@ icious money in the US to buy a yacht , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it , that everyone could make a lawyer to our investigations such as he could transfer@@ able his money .
all these lawyers were all pre@@ valent . no one of the lawyers participated in our client as a client , and of course there was no one of the eman@@ cip@@ ation of money . however , this problem shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single attor@@ ney , who submitted proposals to our secret investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ cian , wound up in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this is very harsh , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has changed ever , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born , I see quite pretty much to change a lot .
over the last few years , we have seen more transparency to see what the owners of firms concerns .
the topic found political attention through the British prime minister David Cameron in 2013 at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has hit central stops at national level , who actually is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US left here .
representatives of both parties have launched a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this is not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closures , this huge insight into the world of control phases as a means is used to ensure more transparency in the USA and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who will see how others can see how other people can hide their true identity behind tim@@ ings companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need senior managers in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ tox@@ icity is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end through the laws of this type of transparency .
together we can finish the in@@ transparency , which now still enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I once was kidn@@ apped and had landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sales .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked forward to my stuff .
he bought one of my art pieces .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ journey across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the error to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he got worse and worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I &apos;m not ab@@ duc@@ ted in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small car boot !
then I heard me : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I built to myself ?
a wild sleep in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , to the door pointed to the door , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork which he purchased from me depends on today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye angle .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers have been sold , actually friends who were waiting waiting for it ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
do we make a time of time , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ t , my ro@@ omm@@ ates come out and rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think , creativity is able to transform it into a lot of fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn anything . our apartment will stay with an designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ett completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door was to the castle , Brian and I tried to join us .
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time ?
things came to roll .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website dedicated to people publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next great thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile might be ign@@ ited .
but did she not .
no one who is yet in comfort would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned as children , that strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , it is thought of things that can be well done . we were designed to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , between people who never had taken before .
can I aff@@ ord design so something ?
is it possible to create trust with design trust ?
I would like to give you a sample , which de@@ cent confidence we t@@ oned .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your company .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet location of panic , which you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a fore@@ igner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like this , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you please declare on Twitter that he di@@ pped for the post of President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail at this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been introduced once again with his name ; if he could tell whence he comes , as his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments who say everyone : &quot; he can hold fast very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust decisive .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest ass@@ ess@@ ments before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we tested a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are at age and home .
little surprising we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find the more we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ gen@@ ome .
exciting will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation among common simil@@ ar@@ ities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much to get from itself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are too little told , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one gets no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just tell how for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal level of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing so with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree to op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which things you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces over strangers .
with what we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these alleg@@ ations .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a requirement that was not covered in advance .
for us the shop is just very good .
of course there are times , if not everything goes smooth .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed part@@ ys or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came right on my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence has broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . I &apos;m already wo@@ e , when I think it &apos;s just about it .
the dis@@ appointment which you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there were only one fraction of the 123 million booked overnight stays .
for people confi@@ ded to each other .
when confidence works , the mar@@ vel can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protection gel that can save life even though they don &apos;t know anything .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to be lon@@ ely , they will get books .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is , of course , not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money supply are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
when I came to this concept for the first time , I asked :
how does the idea of partial transactions fit together with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about an economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the thing is not just right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trading post that human relationships promises .
people put a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if one travels nowadays , it is convenient to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , if travelling a rich buffet from local influences ?
what would be , if in every place you have visited a group there would wait to place a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and a K@@ nei@@ pent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to split flats of reason to inter@@ connecting ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have to adopt the thought of common share ?
I place myself towns , which allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and fir@@ ing .
in Seoul , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking that belonged to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead was ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved . incub@@ ators were started ,
to finance new start@@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be hosting a stranger or self by a stranger .
so the idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome pro@@ found@@ ly @-@ roots .
I think the amazing ,
just overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da drive to me .
we know , of course , that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask for what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think , if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ress , under@@ going a brain la@@ under@@ wear , a terrorist cat ?
or simply a delay at the airport of security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
for instance , the media represent , that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage regarding Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans know my , most would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people do not talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great , you know .
I say you who am I .
I am a mother , a coffee house -- double Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra .
I have for@@ ged you ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ ower @-@ Fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ve me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual human being , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you afflicted yourself ? &quot;
the funny one was : at that time , a femin@@ ist declaration of independence was to me , and compared with the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old feeling me to adapt to a perfect and un@@ ri@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only been passi@@ vely accepted by the faith of my parents .
I have with the Quran .
I read it , I thought that , in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , which are deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm is sometimes bringing me to wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feeling the feeling that someone under@@ takes you completely , and somehow he loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career in engineering .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the valley of Egyptian dream @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came this terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , I had breakfast in late , looked at the screen and looked the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ ats in buildings , people from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock is turned into indign@@ ation quickly .
why should you do so ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam ... &quot; ... , ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; st@@ icky Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my land att@@ acking , but in N@@ u turned me the acts of others from a human being into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember as I went speaking -- as soon as we went silent - so deep it went to my seat , and I feared the first time as Muslim .
we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be careful , &quot; Sei@@ d c@@ auti@@ ous , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lighted , &quot; &quot; assemblies are not deceived . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I looked the extensive coverage .
the feelings were severely damaged , and I heard from attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims in order to break in free , and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but I didn &apos;t feel right .
cause the people who attacked this land , have attacked our land .
I have thrown the rage of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today we can indeed say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want to use Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my congregation as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question is : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or dis@@ closed ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are as all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ s@@ thel@@ e@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ques .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America Make sure saf@@ er ?
there may be a few parking spaces free but do not stop the terror .
regular visit of a mosque leads to illustr@@ ate people &apos;s other faith toler@@ ant , and greater participation .
and as a head of the police in Washington , D.C. recently told : people will actually not be ra@@ dic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you are ra@@ dic@@ alised in their cell@@ ars or in bed before a computer .
with the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it is established that it will start online . as first , the person is cut off from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
when we want to stop ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must keep people to go to the mosque .
some are still asser@@ ted , Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group such as the IS creates its brood @-@ ality with the Quran .
as Muslim , as mother , as a man , I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to the environment when you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you cast a look at her , she does not move in what they are in their &quot; holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is its brood @-@ ality that they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
the Ima@@ m told me recently a amazing history :
a girl came to him because she was trying to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was just the opposite . every spirit , with whom she spoke , brought them to silence , and told her that their wrath , their sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had been given its wake , it was the main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization of extrem@@ ists who spoke to it a solution .
this im@@ m introduced the connection to God and their church .
rather than to acc@@ use them for her rage , he showed her construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what happened in the mosque , they kept it to join the IS .
that was an insight like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family concerned .
but how does it work on normal American ?
how does it work on each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day bring on our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we do not accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows : if you study test persons messages written in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ oss against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it was in advance of the war in Iraq and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation to the public in order to expand the foundation of a free society which has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims must be an early warning sign .
we may feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts to us all .
in the assignment of collective facts it is not only to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , a great man who knew her .
she visited him there and he showed her his cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was amazing and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man made of my breasts ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , as did the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had to visit in the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or t@@ arri@@ ed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision : for what America we wanted to leave our children , one of us would control us through fear , or one where we can ex@@ ert our religion .
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I looked , he left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m had an announcement , and was called our guests welcome , because half of the gathered Christians were Jews , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ cred@@ itors who came not to attack us , but to join us .
in that moment , I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had the courage and compassion of panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what are you interested in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go to the number ?
or become attached to those whom my : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what are you saying that you might say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mem@@ o@@ ist with dr@@ au@@ ght , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you &apos;re not . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so ordinary as it is allowed .
if one look@@ up for Muslims in the whole world , and I did it with the largest according to the survey conducted by Muslims in the whole world , people want normal things .
they want to do prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m an exception in any respect .
if humans appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a one billion .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air p@@ act in our social consciousness , a aut@@ onic fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with arrows .
by connecting terminals , flight devices can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build self @-@ resistant structures as well .
they have learned to carry loads with tur@@ mo@@ il and to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flight in autonomous flight .
in order to work a system aut@@ on@@ om , it needs to know collective dam@@ sel@@ d , where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new local transmission technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest compartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient , efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can h@@ over , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of hed@@ ging is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind b@@ lows .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that are due to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts known to viol@@ ate you .
for decades ago , pilots were able to fly mot@@ orized flying units , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear @-@ ru@@ der .
un@@ long , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote device . it was invented recently .
it has only an event@@ ful part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ders , no further tu@@ g@@ ation or control surfaces , just a propeller .
although mechanically simple is , in the interior live so much that it can fly stable , and can move in space in the room .
nevertheless it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm of the tail @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it just right when I see all , is slim , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in gen@@ ome , this machine is here , the om@@ ni@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ation , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is equivalent in its orientation .
this means that he gets the first ordinary skill ,
in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated , or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some is visible in models , the rest is learned directly in the fly .
let us see that .
if tra@@ ilers are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ propeller @-@ tra@@ ilers .
this revol@@ ves in clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine as well .
we will now demonstrate that , we will make a half f@@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ warming .
the largest number of autonomous , coordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression .
we took retail Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , your demonstrations take care of thinking about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ on wants to become a flyer screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the production act .
it serves as a memory , like wonderful and enchanting our universe , and that it allows creative , wise stories to form them to a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the dot on the i .
thank you .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ving each other in a very far away galaxy , so the mass of three would be in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
this short moment , brigh@@ tly brigh@@ tly brigh@@ ter than all stars in the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very large dum@@ b .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was entered into space @-@ time encoder and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
then we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then the Earth has brought out a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand against us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser system to look after gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by colored black holes .
most of them they stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a mad Gen@@ ies so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometric Gra@@ vit@@ ational Gra@@ vit@@ ational Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was significantly increased , significantly improved the detection performance .
therefore you are now called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor , hard @-@ round problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes led through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and even through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye of my to@@ d@@ k@@ ill father .
basically , the fruit of my life .
all that , for what I had worked , is not longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tically physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their ob@@ servat@@ ories as L@@ IG@@ O signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation shaft is an forces in the area of space and time .
when tigh@@ tening the shaft , the space and its entire content will expand into one direction , and into the other ones .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ tur@@ ers lead to the theory of rel@@ ativity often as often a true dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous , are .
on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched out by us during the gathering of the waves , and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . this was the L@@ IG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear power . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of its classical text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunt the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction such detectors are massive .
but physi@@ cists are inv@@ enting and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott compl@@ ements , L@@ IG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things about us : fac@@ ial features , the size of your cell phone .
that &apos;s quite convenient . for example , you can justi@@ fy an image or a map of things by doing that of several points coming light around you .
the sounds is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things , which means you very much :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties such as ton@@ ing and -@@ height , rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind .
&quot; now she speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob she interrup@@ ts it . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
we can &apos;t produce any simple images of objects in all .
but by having regard to Am@@ pl@@ itude and Frequ@@ ency of waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can literally hear all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation is able to listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already busy very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , layers simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@
it is a kind of movement , expressed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Hear@@ ken L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des odo@@ urs &#93; No one , the knows what he needs to hear , recognize them as noise from -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turns around as fast as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : we are superior to us what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they colon@@ ists .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it never was possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
much in all , we can see -- practically or basically - do not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ac@@ red stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them , we have learned much about all .
the thr@@ illing physical processes happen , but in the core , which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon hi@@ des .
we will never see where these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation shafts hardened iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the ur@@ ge covers all its own neigh@@ bor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O did not find the first start of things that we were not expected .
my colleague on the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that observed black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ bles for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to introduce a completely different angle of view on the events of all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and circulation of cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new servat@@ ories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the ur@@ ge ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
I tried a experiment before some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long would I say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it was anno@@ ying me to say in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
wanted to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the schau@@ spiel ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly that , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , I removed my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life . it started an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called all &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; for unknown reasons . &quot;
then she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ ak cas@@ hier . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was straight on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I listened to me always to play with them . no matter what I &apos;m going to do , or where I go , I say always yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired of that .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood it completely that the &quot; Yes &quot; s@@ ages to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things I &apos;ve contempl@@ ate to live .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in large style .
in this TV season I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously production .
each programme provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV group can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode every nine days and four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars on television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programs simultaneously , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Bird , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series passed succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sol@@ ete . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans to bon@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who makes it yet ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard work if you are now a company , a country or a class@@ room , so that I &apos;m not only going to run around the computer and fant@@ as@@ iere , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that it does not work with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
if I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always a country out of nowhere .
it is , when I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
so as a dre@@ aming man a high tone , a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love to work it .
it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mad@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum .
there is so a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on her .
many people participate if I try to give them the sum@@ s that I talked to you , that the writing is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started with television production , when I began to work and to work and to build up , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ ms is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t aim at any other than according to size .
the feeling not otherwise to aim than to achieve , no matter what price .
this is how you call the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means a work@@ ing@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , more wor@@ ship@@ ments , more work more , the more work there , the more things the same time , the more things me , the more write I history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I run , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ hau@@ led , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burned down .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ um is a sole title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells you people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours day , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do , if what you do , work , which one loves , suddenly hated ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author &apos;s author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you are doing , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a teacher , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you knew the sum@@ s already when the sum@@ s stopped , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South America wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; pos@@ es me a question .
I am on the way outside , late in turn and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say than me two things :
fir@@ stly , I must say Yes to everything and second , they didn &apos;t call me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they call no longer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I guess it if I am Titan and my sum@@ s stun@@ ted , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
nothing is special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can do nothing , save out .
I am focusing on .
I am quiet .
the land , which I run , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists are st@@ icky finger and dam@@ p k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax pen and the song in which it goes to Los@@ ses , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ berg &quot; leaves .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me ce@@ ases .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and this is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium convertible , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are , if I say you , who am I , if I do full of programs and TV hours and how working my brain , I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the living .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ awareness and peace .
real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , the tasks for the tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me the wrong words , for what God said to me , that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I usually do this as a fixed rule , so that I can release me as a work@@ ings of any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I don &apos;t have any choice . I don &apos;t have any choice if I want to listen to the sum@@ s .
I wish it was so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me not at me , as they work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace than at home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a man would rather than to be a house ?
well , yes , I am .
again frank@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too bad is none of it .
we v@@ ases in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ amped soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly boo@@ sting , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always hold on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can do it too ! tell Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
there you may be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones would like to play at most 15 minutes with me until they are affected that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ le or cookie can be replaced .
and speak my Teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my feeling , my world . it must not be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul @-@ peace .
it &apos;s not all playing with her own children . it is about joy ,
around the &quot; games &quot; generally .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m not more tired and I &apos;ll meet friends , books , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she &apos;s short for everything I got when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to go more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in the piece , why not g@@ lowing a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s appears then if I don &apos;t work .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months it opens a door , the energy is coming in , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it satis@@ fies me and my soul . you se@@ duc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my job again .
I like this sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... not anymore .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is me to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I still have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel good as a good mother .
the more I play , the more it is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country that I run , the marathon which I run , the tro@@ ups , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the real sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , self @-@ lasting , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . fewer titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things I &apos;ve contempl@@ ated to live .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ ad@@ ful .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I &apos;m Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very small ability to become self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures .
they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Deep Purple stim@@ ulation . &quot; it is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s , who suffered severe pain and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was gui@@ ding High doctor and worked in the emergency relief day and night .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that using skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain injury and the cran@@ ial pressure is rising .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this , sometimes one has to be removed a part of the cran@@ berry mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen cran@@ ial mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
that is not a light task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece , it is similar to all small children who will be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and surroundings in order to flour@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François did .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the bi@@ ology classes that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organis@@ m .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a more fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided up slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they ensure the break of the brain .
but why do they remain to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury .
but that is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells are exactly as cul@@ tured as Jean François did
and they then select colour @-@ colour to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ sp@@ lan@@ tation .
one of our first questions : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in weak@@ ened brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so disappear .
in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence showing them are these small points . these are the cells that we moved in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual winding task .
you had to take food pellets of a tray .
they made it very well .
when they had reached a stabili@@ zed level of business , we have lost the mot@@ oc@@ ori@@ k area in the motor Cort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it happened in people , they re@@ covering spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , that recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after maturity .
I can tell you that we were very exciting results too .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ ropath@@ ology models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it in humans .
I really hope to show you soon , how to heal the human brain the means to cure yourself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question , which are the biggest obstacles , before you start clinical trials involving human subjects .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the highest obst@@ acle are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone may come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it has already been a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to use a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we are making a big mistake in the west as of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant which she is in reality , but as Invent@@ ory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changeable ear .
we believe that capitalism is forced to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his grand im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing showed that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy over us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous by me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not aff@@ ecting the savings programmes , which were realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my getting @-@ up friends who would repeat me if they would change anything if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of error , we could save our democracy , but that we might need a perceived and rein@@ forcing democracy .
because without democracy our societies are in common , our future dark , and our great , new technologies .
on the topic of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threatened our inn .
I call it the &quot; Twin @-@ summit @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long sh@@ adows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the school @-@ den@@ berg ,
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of unused currency , which belongs to the real savings and corporations that could be in@@ timi@@ dated , where it could be productive and revenues , with which you could produce the debt and also all these things might need to produce mankind , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the euro zone it invested 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion US dollars still sounds after a lot of money until reaching the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not affect the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low demand for investors who could not invest in which they cannot invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father who could not invest in which they would kill him if his son would kill him if he grow up ,
invol@@ unt@@ arily , the circumstances are leading to the fact that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
his extremely rare art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continued : what do we understand under Democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy decided , of course , too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would be a mistake to reduce the place of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these out@@ casts .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave them the working arms , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vote in questions of state labor .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy did not have been held long --
like a candle , which sh@@ ines very bright , it is burned quickly .
however , our today Liber@@ al demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy strengthened itself on the free citizens , and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy based on the assets of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy first came up when a full separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was occupied by the policy , while the economy was the world of the corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ itary battle between the two and the economy gradually emigrated to politics and de@@ pri@@ ve them .
do you wonder why the politicians are not like that ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is true that one can be in the government today , and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is ab@@ used and the areas separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in such a way as a herd of prey that is so lasting the animals of which it is nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry afterward .
similar to the economy , which has so far can@@ ni@@ fied by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grow to political goods , the ine@@ quality is rising , the overall economic demand , and the managing director of corporations are to be sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful of capitalism is the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we must meet the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves the control as in the Anci@@ ent Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very special .
the law from the de@@ acon in the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position as in the Anci@@ ent Athens without creating new species of brood @-@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : manage the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low wages by automation and rob@@ otic systems .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin peaks are higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon , as I do believe -- in countries such as China will come .
we must unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics again , and consider that we are democr@@ atically deleg@@ ate the re@@ united area , otherwise we will be able to show the film matrix as a documentation .
the question is not that capitalism has resulted in the technical achievements that he has resulted . --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ opia , similar to those of the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in the machines serving people and to put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the Anci@@ ent Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I think we are to be optim@@ istic .
so what do it mean , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ opy ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you brief , some examples will be mentioned .
in the area of the company : ask a capital market in which you earn money , while you are working and in your capital to you from a job place to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and income from funds and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but the company does not hear . no di@@ stra@@ ction more between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and don@@ or , and ultimately doesn &apos;t asc@@ end up @-@ up tw@@ ins .
in the area of the global political economy : imagine that our national currencies could have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that it was not possible to implement the technical funds at that time .
today we have them , especially in front of a restored politics and economy .
the world , which I be@@ g you , is also liberal , in which they preferred privileged users , and mar@@ x@@ ious because it is buried the separation of capital and work in a tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all others , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we &apos;re doing it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said about , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do this , the technological development will generate such a massive reduction in overall economic demand , what Larry Sum@@ mer is called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth on the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democracy but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy .
when this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are good .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical declaration -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Red@@ ner you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West in China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy plays , -- the area of economy -- a fully democracy @-@ free zone is .
in a certain respec@@ ts when I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically viewed .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can watch in China , similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece &apos;s beginning at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal sight , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ counter@@ feit , and ongoing den@@ ying that a massive failure line was passed through the Eurozone , and continues to be threatened with the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek fore@@ arms -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal this denied --
unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the Euro Area , have not denied the denied boarding .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries an economic system that is not over@@ able to get out through political will and authority @-@ mil@@ itar@@ ism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but if the change goes , he de@@ ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroy it .
BG : what change you see before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harvest ...
if there is an Minister of Finance , or some minister , that after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ stressed situation , he claims to have no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in the financial position to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring out our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with ship@@ ments , which ran through the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to conce@@ de that she had been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program for Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika of the Bank@@ ers , who has imposed on this policy , stamped and said : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ ano@@ inting error . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a European @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive .
for if they did not survive , the released tile forces will be D@@ ä@@ mon@@ astic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in that point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for having been at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
with Roy Price , most of them never heard , although it probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an ion cure and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , it is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
it must find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , it must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation ratio of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after having seen a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average explo@@ iting , the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they do not insp@@ ire .
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon is something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needed a guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition .
it takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will display them online where you can watch them for free .
and if Amazon is free for nothing , you are att@@ acking correctly ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed during watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that would receive everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ p or check again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence emer@@ ges : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show may remember because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- by the meaning of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 -- and Alpha House remains at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time when another company has set up a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and it uses data for it , but it does something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then use these data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows them , what producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a venture and decided to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competent , data experienced companies .
they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that mean ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with all .
if you g@@ athers millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized through very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is a good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , this is something terri@@ fying because we are living in a time that we want more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if anyone asks here in the US and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that &apos;s not what a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems knows not how to use data .
data se@@ di@@ versi@@ fied companies do not lie wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes too .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predic@@ t out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , predic@@ ts -- by data analysis of the Google search .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news station . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year , until it did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the publication of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data se@@ di@@ versi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understood something .
despite all these errors , the decisions have been made in decisions of life -- at the workplace , on the workplace , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ supported gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use in@@ conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern on the difference between successful choices on the basis of data and not successful choices . this pattern should be widespread .
to solve a complex problem , you need mainly two things :
as the first dis@@ assem@@ bling this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze the single parts ; as a second , set up the single parts to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , there are parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , then , especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you use data to understand their audience better , wher@@ eto you would not have been able . but the decision to put together all these parts , set up again and a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they were a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all its decisions , first as they wake up TV ideas , then as they selected &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and that it is not forgotten , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a J@@ ua or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to wi@@ pe it later with a technique demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a little more exclusion , such as data analysis to make better choices .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . finally , it is on us to make decisions if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message , that it still pays out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data still to meet decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks that you will land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
