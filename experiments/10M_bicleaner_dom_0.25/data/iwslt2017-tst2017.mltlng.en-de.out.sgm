<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that NSA's illegal telephones have heard from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret operation in which the CIA delivered Iran's official designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, who did not know the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been determined against Risen and called him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train it became the symbol for the design of the government to condemn Whistleblower and to occupy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constituency, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media are not able to protect this information and if they can not protect identity of the mud, which they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government drew near Risen, he did something what many courageous reportage came before him: he refused, and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they were without doubt that it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide in less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and Risen, they could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without being comprehended, relying his phone-wise secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and band information, its credit card, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn the CIA-Whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her job as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of being a Whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press work on the game that shall be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has always expanded more possibilities to attract all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government permits to circumvent the rights of reporkers, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can get from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the subsequent, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen, his book, and it is much more safer than normal emails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">A such technology is a SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet most famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant News Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government may not cure more information secretly, and many of the information that would like it would be not available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop new spying technologies all over the world, all of which are to endanger ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is necessary to ensure that not only technology numbers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to put abuse. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over abuse during the supply of soldiers would like to know and reported by overcrowded hospitals, the alarm to the faded water of Flint. or a Wallpaper insider, which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data spot of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] This week, we were asked by news about a leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of how clients, banks and lawyers like Mossack Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, such as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland prime minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ban of brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad stationed companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, with a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait, wait to wait for the next publication, and to expose to the next publication.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems that cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets under tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few people are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will be very confusing this whole world and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I place it always like a Matrjoschkapuger.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really, which thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no major Americans so far that occurred in these revelations in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who store their property in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a bit of data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed to handle school children to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It allows you to reboot especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a secret investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African Minister, the suspicious money in the US to buy a yacht, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it, that everyone could make a lawyer to our investigations such as he could transferable his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">All these lawyers were all prevalent. no one of the lawyers participated in our client as a client, and of course there was no one of the emancipation of money. however, this problem shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single attorney, who submitted proposals to our secret investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician, wound up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This is very harsh, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has changed ever, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born, I see quite pretty much to change a lot.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last few years, we have seen more transparency to see what the owners of firms concerns.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through the British prime minister David Cameron in 2013 at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has hit central stops at national level, who actually is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US left here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have launched a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this is not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosures, this huge insight into the world of control phases as a means is used to ensure more transparency in the USA and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will see how others can see how other people can hide their true identity behind timings companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need senior managers in the economy that arise and say:" "" "intoxicity is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end through the laws of this type of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the intransparency, which now still enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I once was kidnapped and had landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked forward to my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art pieces.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadjourney across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the error to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He got worse and worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I'm not abducted in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I built to myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, to the door pointed to the door, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork which he purchased from me depends on today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers have been sold, actually friends who were waiting waiting for it?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I went to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Do we make a time of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plet, my roommates come out and rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity is able to transform it into a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn anything. our apartment will stay with an designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelett completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door was to the castle, Brian and I tried to join us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website dedicated to people publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next great thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile might be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did she not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet in comfort would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children, that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, it is thought of things that can be well done. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, between people who never had taken before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can I afford design so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which decent confidence we toned.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your company.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet location of panic, which you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like this, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he dipped for the post of President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been introduced once again with his name; if he could tell whence he comes, as his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments who say everyone: "he can hold fast very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest assessments before we ordered them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We tested a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are at age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the more we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pregenome.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation among common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much to get from itself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you are too little told, for example" "" "Hi!" "", "one gets no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">Just tell how for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "Great art works in your apartment! I'm doing so with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree to openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which things you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices over strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these allegations.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a requirement that was not covered in advance.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything goes smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed partys or have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came right on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence has broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. I'm already woe, when I think it's just about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which you hear in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there were only one fraction of the 123 million booked overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, the marvel can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection gel that can save life even though they don't know anything.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to be lonely, they will get books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money supply are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I came to this concept for the first time, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of partial transactions fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just a" "" "rental industry" "" "now, the thing is not just right." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trading post that human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels nowadays, it is convenient to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if travelling a rich buffet from local influences?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if in every place you have visited a group there would wait to place a thoroughly replenish and a Kneipentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to split flats of reason to interconnecting?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to adopt the thought of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I place myself towns, which allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and firing.</seg>
<seg id="239">In Seoul, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead was,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new startups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be hosting a stranger or self by a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profoundly-roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think the amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda drive to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask for what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppress, undergoing a brain launderwear, a terrorist cat?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport of security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">For instance, the media represent, that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage regarding Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans know my, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say you who am I.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee house -- double Espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I have forged you,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtower-Fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to ouve me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual human being, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why are you afflicted yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny one was: at that time, a feminist declaration of independence was to me, and compared with the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old feeling me to adapt to a perfect and unriable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only been passively accepted by the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, I thought that, in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, which are deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm is sometimes bringing me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feeling the feeling that someone undertakes you completely, and somehow he loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career in engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the valley of Egyptian dream-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came this terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, I had breakfast in late, looked at the screen and looked the word "Eileen."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes floats in buildings, people from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock is turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "In the name of Islam..."...,... "Jihadist..."... "..." sticky Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my land attacking, but in Nu turned me the acts of others from a human being into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as I went speaking -- as soon as we went silent - so deep it went to my seat, and I feared the first time as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went to our apartment in this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be careful," Seid cautious, "" Stay in well lighted, "" assemblies are not deceived. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were severely damaged, and I heard from attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims in order to break in free, and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandances on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But I didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Cause the people who attacked this land, have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have thrown the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">The allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can indeed say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to use Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my congregation as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question is: are we malignant or disclosed?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are as all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelefer and Olympioniques.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America Make sure safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces free but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to illustrate people's other faith tolerant, and greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in Washington, D.C. recently told: people will actually not be radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You are radicalised in their cellars or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">With the radicalization process, it is established that it will start online. as first, the person is cut off from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhor their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to stop radicalization, we must keep people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still asserted, Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group such as the IS creates its brood-ality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as mother, as a man, I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">"" "" "" "but we would add to the environment when you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers." ""</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you cast a look at her, she does not move in what they are in their "holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brood-ality that they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Imam told me recently a amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she was trying to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was just the opposite. every spirit, with whom she spoke, brought them to silence, and told her that their wrath, their sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had been given its wake, it was the main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who spoke to it a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imm introduced the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to accuse them for her rage, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What happened in the mosque, they kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight like the Islamophobia me and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal American?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day bring on our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you study test persons messages written in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swoss against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in advance of the war in Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation to the public in order to expand the foundation of a free society which has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims must be an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts to us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective facts it is not only to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, a great man who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his curriculum. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a young man made of my breasts?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, was murdered, as did the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had to visit in the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatiism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or tarried at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision: for what America we wanted to leave our children, one of us would control us through fear, or one where we can exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I looked, he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam had an announcement, and was called our guests welcome, because half of the gathered Christians were Jews, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-creditors who came not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you interested in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go to the number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become attached to those whom my: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what are you saying that you might say that you are a TEDTalk, a memoist with draught, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you're not. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one lookup for Muslims in the whole world, and I did it with the largest according to the survey conducted by Muslims in the whole world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to do prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists, is about to become a one billion.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pact in our social consciousness, a autonic fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with arrows.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting terminals, flight devices can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resistant structures as well.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turmoil and to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flight in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work a system autonom, it needs to know collective damseld, where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new local transmission technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest compartment." "" "and" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters it is efficient, efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can hover, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedging is that they react sensitively to turmoil as wind blows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that are due to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts known to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago, pilots were able to fly motorized flying units, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear-ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only an eventful part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross-ruders, no further tugation or control surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although mechanically simple is, in the interior live so much that it can fly stable, and can move in space in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm of the tail-starters. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it just right when I see all, is slim, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a exercise in genome, this machine is here, the omniter with its eight propellation, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is equivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">This means that he gets the first ordinary skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated, or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is visible in models, the rest is learned directly in the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If trailers are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propeller-trailers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine as well.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that, we will make a half fairworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The largest number of autonomous, coordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took retail Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, your demonstrations take care of thinking about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as dron wants to become a flyer screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the production act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, like wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it allows creative, wise stories to form them to a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolving each other in a very far away galaxy, so the mass of three would be in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, brightly brightly brighter than all stars in the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very large dumb.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was entered into space-time encoder and the universe exploded in gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="475">Then we arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought out a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand against us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser system to look after gravitational waves, which are formed by colored black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them they stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a mad Genies so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometric Gravitational Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, significantly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you are now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, hard-round problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes led through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And even through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye of my todkill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruit of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that, for what I had worked, is not longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretically physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories as LIGO signals. what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation shaft is an forces in the area of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When tightening the shaft, the space and its entire content will expand into one direction, and into the other ones.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers lead to the theory of relativity often as often a true dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretching and dust, stretching and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched out by us during the gathering of the waves, and the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the Comma, followed by a 1. this was the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandths of a nuclear power. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of its classical text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunt the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties when construction such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventing and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott complements, LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things about us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite convenient. for example, you can justify an image or a map of things by doing that of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">The sounds is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things, which means you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as toning and -height, rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now she speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob she interrupts it."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by having regard to Amplitude and Frequency of waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are in the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can literally hear all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation is able to listen to us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, layers simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, expressed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Hearken LIGO: [Surrendes odours] No one, the knows what he needs to hear, recognize them as noise from -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which turns around as fast as the sticks of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other with a mass of 36 Suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they colonists.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it never was possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can see -- practically or basically - do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massacred stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them, we have learned much about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes happen, but in the core, which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hides.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see where these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation shafts hardened iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urge covers all its own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO did not find the first start of things that we were not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that observed black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sauerknobles for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to introduce a completely different angle of view on the events of all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and circulation of cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new servatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urge?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">I tried a experiment before some time.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long would I say to everything" Yes! "" "" I feared. "" "</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it was annoying me to say in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the schauspiel?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly that, wovor I feared, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life. it started an unexpectedly art. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, called all "estimation" for unknown reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="570">Then she would be a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beak cashier."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was straight on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I listened to me always to play with them. no matter what I'm going to do, or where I go, I say always yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired of that.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood it completely that the "Yes" sages to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things I've contemplate to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV group can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days and four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars on television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programs simultaneously, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: show To Get Away With Bird, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series passed successively on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obsolete. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans to bonfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it, because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard work if you are now a company, a country or a classroom, so that I'm not only going to run around the computer and fantasiere, and it's true if I say: I understand that it does not work with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a dreaming man a high tone, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and madly, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate if I try to give them the sums that I talked to you, that the writing is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started with television production, when I began to work and to work and to build up, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summs is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a sums, you can't aim at any other than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not otherwise to aim than to achieve, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is how you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means a workingolic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, more worshipments, more work more, the more work there, the more things the same time, the more things me, the more write I history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I run, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overhauled, exaggerated, burned down.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a sole title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells you people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours day, continuous weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what you do, work, which one loves, suddenly hated?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some like" "" "Heul you out, the author's author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you are doing, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a teacher, and knows how to feel the sums when you knew the sums already when the sums stopped, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stop, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South America waitress" poses me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way outside, late in turn and she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say than me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">Firstly, I must say Yes to everything and second, they didn't call me. "</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "they call no longer" "" "estimation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I guess it if I am Titan and my sums stunted, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing is special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters stumble, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sums, I can do nothing, save out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I run, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and damp kisses, delicate voices, wax pen and the song in which it goes to Losses, or whatever the girl in "Die Eisberg" leaves.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that me.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me ceases.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium convertible, which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are, if I say you, who am I, if I do full of programs and TV hours and how working my brain, I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the living.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks for the tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me the wrong words, for what God said to me, that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually do this as a fixed rule, so that I can release me as a workings of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I don't have any choice. I don't have any choice if I want to listen to the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not at me, as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man would rather than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Again frankly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too bad is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We vases in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cramped soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly boosting, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always hold on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why did we ever listen to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! tell Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll keep me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you may be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones would like to play at most 15 minutes with me until they are affected that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladle or cookie can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my Teenie daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no deposit.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeling, my world. it must not be the children. it applies to feel the sums to have a place for his soul-peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not all playing with her own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" generally.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm not more tired and I'll meet friends, books, books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "if you want to play?" "" "she's short for everything I got when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to go more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece, why not glowing a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums appears then if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months it opens a door, the energy is coming in, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it satisfies me and my soul. you seducts me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like this sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not I... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I still have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel good as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more it is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I run, the marathon which I run, the troups, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the real sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, self-lasting, naked and new life-feeling in me wide. fewer titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think things I've contemplated to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I'm Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very small ability to become self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have one of the most well-known, the "Deep Purple stimulation." it is implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's, who suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was guiding High doctor and worked in the emergency relief day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that using skull-brain traumata brain injury and the cranial pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes one has to be removed a part of the cranberry mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen cranial mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">That is not a light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece, it is similar to all small children who will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and surroundings in order to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology classes that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a more fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided up slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the Fötus, they ensure the break of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area and then the cells are exactly as cultured as Jean François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then select colour-colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in weakened brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence showing them are these small points. these are the cells that we moved in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual winding task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stabilized level of business, we have lost the motocorik area in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it happened in people, they recovering spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting results too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathology models, for example in Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon, how to heal the human brain the means to cure yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question, which are the biggest obstacles, before you start clinical trials involving human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the highest obstacle are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone may come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has already been a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to use a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We are making a big mistake in the west as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant which she is in reality, but as Inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable ear.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is forced to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his grand imitators in Beijing showed that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy over us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous by me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not affecting the savings programmes, which were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my getting-up friends who would repeat me if they would change anything if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of error, we could save our democracy, but that we might need a perceived and reinforcing democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are in common, our future dark, and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatened our inn.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin-summit-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schodenberg, who throws his long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the school-denberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused currency, which belongs to the real savings and corporations that could be intimidated, where it could be productive and revenues, with which you could produce the debt and also all these things might need to produce mankind, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the euro zone it invested 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars still sounds after a lot of money until reaching the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that do not affect the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low demand for investors who could not invest in which they cannot invest. just like Oedipus father who could not invest in which they would kill him if his son would kill him if he grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances are leading to the fact that Ödipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely rare art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continued: what do we understand under Democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form, in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy decided, of course, too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would be a mistake to reduce the place of athenian democracy due to these outcasts.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that they gave them the working arms, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal vote in questions of state labor.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenic democracy did not have been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today Liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy strengthened itself on the free citizens, and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy based on the assets of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first came up when a full separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was occupied by the policy, while the economy was the world of the corporations -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an unitary battle between the two and the economy gradually emigrated to politics and deprive them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are not like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is true that one can be in the government today, and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is abused and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in such a way as a herd of prey that is so lasting the animals of which it is nourished, decimated that they are hungry afterward.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similar to the economy, which has so far cannified by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grow to political goods, the inequality is rising, the overall economic demand, and the managing director of corporations are to be scared to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism is the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we must meet the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves the control as in the Ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn't very special.</seg>
<seg id="952">The law from the deacon in the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position as in the Ancient Athens without creating new species of brood-ality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: manage the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low wages by automation and robotic systems.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin peaks are higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon, as I do believe -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics again, and consider that we are democratically delegate the reunited area, otherwise we will be able to show the film matrix as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not that capitalism has resulted in the technical achievements that he has resulted. --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a Dystopia, similar to those of the society in "Star Trek," in the machines serving people and to put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the Ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we are to be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what do it mean, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you brief, some examples will be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: ask a capital market in which you earn money, while you are working and in your capital to you from a job place to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income from funds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but the company does not hear. no distraction more between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and donor, and ultimately doesn't ascend up-up twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of the global political economy: imagine that our national currencies could have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not possible to implement the technical funds at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of a restored politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I beg you, is also liberal, in which they preferred privileged users, and marxious because it is buried the separation of capital and work in a trash of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink in a "matrix" - similar Dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we're doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said about, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do this, the technological development will generate such a massive reduction in overall economic demand, what Larry Summer is called" long-term stagnation "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth on the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracy but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">When this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are good.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical declaration -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Redner you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big level of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy plays, -- the area of economy -- a fully democracy-free zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain respects when I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China, similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece's beginning at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal sight, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the self-counterfeit, and ongoing denying that a massive failure line was passed through the Eurozone, and continues to be threatened with the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek forearms -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denied --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, within the Euro Area, have not denied the denied boarding.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries an economic system that is not overable to get out through political will and authority-militarism in life, it may be delayed for a while, but if the change goes, he deabruptly and destroy it.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change you see before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is an Minister of Finance, or some minister, that after 6 months in office, especially in a so-stressed situation, he claims to have no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in the financial position to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring out our government, only because they didn't want to deal with shipments, which ran through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to concede that she had been a catastrophic program for Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika of the Bankers, who has imposed on this policy, stamped and said: "that was a colosanointing error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite a European-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the released tile forces will be Dämonastic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose the way of a post-modern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">With Roy Price, most of them never heard, although it probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an ion cure and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, it is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">It must find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation ratio of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after having seen a season, your brain asks, "Where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to undertake "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average exploiting, the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is something like that, so Roy Price doesn't risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needed a guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">It takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will display them online where you can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free for nothing, you are attacking correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed during watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that would receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you paused, which parts you skip or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and hence emerges: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show may remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- by the meaning of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 -- and Alpha House remains at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time when another company has set up a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and it uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix spectators, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows them, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a venture and decided to make a Sitcom over four Senators but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that mean?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gathers millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is a good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work so, this is something terrifying because we are living in a time that we want more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the US and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not what a company like Multi-Health Systems knows not how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Data sediversified companies do not lie wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes too.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, predicts -- by data analysis of the Google search.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year, until it did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the publication of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sediversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understood something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, the decisions have been made in decisions of life -- at the workplace, on the workplace, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-supported genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern on the difference between successful choices on the basis of data and not successful choices. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">To solve a complex problem, you need mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As the first disassembling this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze the single parts; as a second, set up the single parts to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, there are parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then, especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You use data to understand their audience better, whereto you would not have been able. but the decision to put together all these parts, set up again and a show such as "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they were a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all its decisions, first as they wake up TV ideas, then as they selected "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and that it is not forgotten, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic "" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions with a Jua or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "highly likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'm going to wipe it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, and I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a little more exclusion, such as data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball klüger and klüger and klüger. finally, it is on us to make decisions if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message, that it still pays out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data still to meet decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks that you will land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
